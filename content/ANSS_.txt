 item 1a risk factors 

the following are important factors we have identified that could affect our future results and an investment in our securities although the risks are organized by headings and each risk is described separately many of the risks are interrelated 

you should not interpret the disclosure of any risk factor to imply that the risk has not already materialized while we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect our business prospects financial condition results of operations or cash flows in the future in addition from time to time we provide information including information contained in this annual report on form 10k that contains forwardlooking statements concerning among other things projected financial performance total addressable market market and industry sector growth product development and commercialization or other aspects of future operations such statements are based on the assumptions and expectations of our management at the time such statements are made we caution investors that our performance and any forwardlooking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties including but not limited to the following 

global operational risks 

adverse economic and geopolitical conditions may impact our operations and financial performance 

our operations and performance depend significantly on global macroeconomic specific foreign country and us domestic economic conditions recently inflation rates in the us have increased adverse conditions in the macroeconomic environment including high inflation may result in decreased demand for our products and services constrained credit and liquidity reduced government spending and volatility in equity and foreign exchange markets in addition significant downturns and volatility in the global economy expose us to impairments of certain assets if their values deteriorate tighter credit due to economic conditions may diminish our future borrowing ability and increase borrowing costs under our existing credit facilities customers ability to pay for our products and services may also be impaired which could lead to an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts and writeoffs of accounts receivable 

a significant portion of our business comes from outside the us and our customers supply a wide array of goods and services to most of the worlds major economic regions international revenue represented 545 538 and 579 of our total revenue 

table of contents 

for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively in fiscal year 2021 our largest geographic revenue bases were the us japan and germany 

when the significant economies in which we do business deteriorate or suffer a period of uncertainty our business and financial performance may be impacted through reduced customer and government spending changes in purchasing cycles or timing and reduced access to credit for our customers among other events furthermore customer spending levels in any foreign jurisdiction may be adversely impacted by changes in domestic policies including tax and trade policies a substantial portion of our license and maintenance revenue is derived from annual lease and maintenance contracts which typically have a high rate of customer renewal when the rate of renewal for these contracts is adversely affected by economic or other factors our lease license and maintenance growth is adversely affected 

if we are unable to attract and retain key talent our business could be adversely affected 

the market for talent in the technology industry has become increasingly competitive in the wake of covid19 because of the highly technical nature of our products and services we must continue to attract and retain skilled personnel these skilled roles are challenging to fill given the recent job market dynamics including wage inflation and our talent has been the subject of recruitment by our competitors while we have noncompetition and nonsolicitation agreements with many of these individuals the enforceability of these agreements may be limited by the courts 

in addition our success depends upon the continued service of our senior executives and our key technical and sales employees most of these individuals could terminate their relationship with us at any time the loss of any of them for which there has not been adequate knowledgesharing and transfer might significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives and could materially harm our business and customer relationships 

while we have historically recruited globally for positions in the us in recent years our ability to do so has been curbed by more restrictive domestic immigration laws if the immigration laws become even stricter or the processing of immigration requests becomes even more cumbersome or less efficient or if we have less success in recruiting and retaining key personnel our business reputation and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 

we are subject to trade restrictions that could impact our ability to sell to customers and result in liability for violations 

due to the global nature of our business we are subject to domestic and international trade protection laws policies sanctions and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment for example we are subject to import and export restrictions and regulations that prohibit the shipment or provision of certain products and services to certain countries regions and persons targeted by the us including the export administration regulations administered by the us bureau of industry and security bis economic and trade sanctions administered by the us treasury departments office of foreign assets control ofac and international traffic in arms regulations itar administered by the department of state’s directorate of defense trade controls ddtc in 2021 bis continued to add more companies including existing customers to its entity list and ofac continued to increase the number of companies subject to its sanctions which continues to limit the companies with which we can do business 

the entity list and ofac restrictions limit our ability to deliver products and services to these customers and in the absence of a license our ability to sell products and services to these customers in the future in addition restrictions implemented by ofac restrict our ability to sell to or transact with restricted individuals entities or countries the inclusion of companies on the entity list and subjecting companies to the heightened restrictions may encourage them to seek substitute products from competitors whose products are not subject to these restrictions or to develop their own products we cannot predict whether or when any changes will be made that eliminate or decrease these limitations on our ability to sell products and provide services to these customers additionally other existing and prospective customers may be added to the entity list andor be subjected to trade restrictions in the future and such actions may result in other indirect impacts that cannot be quantified including the imposition of additional trade restrictions on our business by the us china or other countries restrictions on our ability to sell and ship to customers could have a significant adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial statements 

our products could also be shipped to restricted parties by third parties including our channel partners even though we take measures to ensure that our channel partners comply with all applicable trade restrictions any failure by channel partners to comply with such restrictions could have negative consequences for us violators of trade restrictions may be subject to significant penalties which may include considerable monetary fines criminal proceedings against them and their officers and employees a denial of export privileges and suspension or debarment from selling products or services to the federal government any such penalties could have a significant adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial statements in addition the political and media scrutiny surrounding any governmental investigation could cause significant expense and reputational harm and distract senior executives from managing normal daytoday operations

the covid19 pandemic has had and is expected to continue to have an effect on our business employees and consolidated financial statements 

the health and safety of our employees and their families our partners and our other constituents around the world is a high priority at the onset of the covid19 pandemic we took action to enable our employees to work from home we closed our offices including our corporate headquarters transitioned to a remote work environment and implemented certain travel restrictions each of which has changed how we operate our business we continue to monitor and manage the situation but as of now remote access remains the primary means of work for most of our workforce we previously announced our plans for postpandemic work arrangements these plans include options for our employees to work from home in the office or on a flexible basis where they can alternate between the office and home the adoption of the arrangements is subject to evolving local guidelines on precautions to be taken to mitigate covid19 risk to our employees and customers 

requirements related to covid19 safety precautions including covid19 vaccine mandates of varying scope and applicability such as us executive order 14042 may apply to operations in the us or other jurisdictions in which our business operates failure to comply with the applicable requirements could create the risk of potential loss of business including with respect to our us government contracts or agreements with customers who contract with the us government which could have an adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial statements our implementation of various mandatory vaccination testing or other requirements related to covid19 safety may result in a reduction in productivity of our workforce attrition of management personnel or technical talent or in a reduction in employee morale which could have an adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial statements 

the covid19 outbreak continues to cause business slowdowns and shutdowns in affected areas while inperson meetings have started to resume as well as live attendance at trade events a majority of our customer events and those of our channel partners remain virtual only experiences virtual events may not be as successful as customer events prior to covid19 because among other reasons the limited number of such events the varying attendance levels and virtual event fatigue 

an extended period of remote work arrangements may negatively impact the sales pipeline due to reduced delayed or altered sales and marketing interactions with customers and potential customers expose us to increased risk of cyber incidents delay or alter product roadmaps or research and development due to reduced or limited access to technologies equipment or services and delay or disrupt recruitment efforts limitations on availability ease of use or increased cost related to the use of our products in our customers remote work environments could also result in a decline in demand for our products 

the situation surrounding the covid19 pandemic remains fluid and given its inherent uncertainty we expect the pandemic will continue to have an impact on our business and consolidated financial statements in the near term the duration and extent of the impact from the covid19 pandemic depends on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time such as the timing and effectiveness of vaccination efforts in the markets where we do business transmission rates of the virus and the development of virus mutations and variants the nature and scope of government economic recovery measures and the extent and effectiveness of containment actions the impact of the covid19 pandemic may also have the effect of heightening many other risks and uncertainties described in this risk factors section 

failure to comply with global data privacy laws could give rise to regulatory enforcement action monetary penalties loss of the ability to do business in certain jurisdictions or reputational harm 

we are subject to global data privacy laws and regulations addressing the processing of personal data as the global focus on data privacy regulation continues to increase standards governing the processing of personal data continue to become more strict conflicting and numerous as a result potential risks may intensify as our global business pursues data privacy compliance 

the general data protection regulation european union the data protection act united kingdom the personal information protection and electronic documents act canada the personal information protection law china the law concerning the protection of personal information japan the personal information protection act south korea many state and federal privacy laws within the us and other similar global laws in locations in which we do business collectively privacy laws govern our global data privacy practices additionally privacy laws impose abundant compliance obligations related to our processing of personal data arising from i the delivery of our products and services to our customers and ii our business operations involving employee data 

compliance with privacy laws has and will continue to require the deployment of substantial resources and increased costs as the global data privacy landscape continues to change including i new and varying restrictions on the transfer of personal data across borders ii the growing list of privacy rights afforded to individuals of certain jurisdictions iii data minimization requirements and iv the growing number of governmental agencies dedicated to the preservation of data privacy rights we may be required to make significant changes to our software applications or business operations such changes may increase 

table of contents 

the cost and complexity of delivering our products and services in some markets require an investment in additional resources or tools to manage our data privacy compliance give rise to operational interruption in the performance of services for customers or adversely affect the internal processing of employee information 

failure to comply with privacy laws may lead to regulatory enforcement actions loss of the ability to do business in certain jurisdictions or inquiries and investigations into our activities all of which could result in monetary penalties reputational damage lawsuits extensive and prescriptive consent decrees or judgments additional software resources increased workforce or added expenses may be required to return the company to a compliant data privacy status 

failure to comply with laws and regulations could harm our business 

we develop and sell software and consulting services and maintain support operations in various countries whose laws and practices differ from one another and are subject to unexpected changes furthermore our business is subject to regulation by various global governmental agencies including agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing employment and labor laws workplace safety environmental laws consumer protection laws antibribery laws importexport controls securities laws and tax laws and regulations in certain jurisdictions these regulatory requirements may be more stringent than those in the us managing these geographically diverse operations requires significant attention and resources to ensure compliance 

our global reach includes countries considered highrisk environments for public corruption this exposes us to risks associated with violations of anticorruption laws and regulations such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act to promote compliance we forbid our agents and employees from engaging in corrupt behavior and have implemented a compliance program to prevent and detect violations of anticorruption laws there remains however a risk that illegal conduct could occur thereby exposing us to the financial and reputational risks associated with a violation of anticorruption laws 

noncompliance with applicable regulations or requirements could subject us to investigations sanctions enforcement actions disgorgement of profits fines damages civil and criminal penalties or injunctions and may result in our inability to provide certain products and services to existing or prospective customers if any governmental sanctions are imposed or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation or if customers make claims against us for compensation our business and consolidated financial statements could be harmed in addition responding to any action will likely result in a significant diversion of management’s attention and resources and an increase in professional fees and costs enforcement actions and sanctions could have a significant adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial statements 

a catastrophic event or infrastructure failure could result in the loss of business and adverse financial consequences 

a significant portion of our personnel source code and computer equipment is located in the us canada india japan and throughout europe a natural disaster including significant disruptions in weather as a result of global climate change cyberattack terrorist act pandemic or other unforeseen catastrophe in any of these areas or a breakdown in our business infrastructure such as an interruption in power supply telephone system or information technology systems could cause disruptions to our sales operations services and product development activities as our sales are generally greater at the end of a quarter the potential adverse effects resulting from any of these events would be accentuated if they occurred at quarter end 

effective business continuity disaster recovery and crisis management plans are critical to minimizing the impact of such unplanned or unexpected events we also face increasing customer certification requirements with respect to such systems failure to establish plans that effectively mitigate the impacts of these disruptions or meet customer certification requirements could have a significant adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial statements 

see the covid19 pandemic has had and is expected to continue to have an effect on our business employees and consolidated financial statements portion of this risk factors section for a description of the risk associated with the pandemic 

industry operational risks 

our industry is highly competitive which could result in downward pressure on our prices 

we continue to experience competition across all markets for our products and services some of our current and potential competitors have greater financial technical marketing and other resources than we do and some have wellestablished relationships with our current and potential customers our current and potential competitors also include firms that have competed or may in the future compete by means of open source licensing companies we have or could have strategic alliances with could reduce or discontinue technical software development and marketing relationships with us for competitive purposes 

table of contents 

if our competitors offer deep discounts on certain products or services or develop products that the marketplace considers more valuable we may lower prices or offer discounts or other favorable terms to compete successfully our maintenance products which include software license updates and product support fees are generally priced as a percentage of new software license fees our competitors may offer lower percentage pricing on product updates and support some competitors may bundle software products for promotional purposes or as a longterm pricing strategy or provide guarantees of prices product implementations or wider geographical license usage provisions any of these practices could over time significantly constrain the prices that we can charge for certain products 

furthermore if we do not adapt pricing models to reflect changes in customer usage of our products or changes in customer demand our software license revenues could decrease additionally increased distribution of applications through application service providers including softwareasaservice providers may reduce the average price of our products or adversely affect other sales of our products reducing new software license revenues unless we can offset price reductions with volume increases 

these competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes price reductions andor increased operating costs and could result in lower revenues margins and net income 

we may not be successful in developing and marketing new products to adequately address the rapidly changing technology industry 

we operate in an industry generally characterized by rapidly changing technology and frequent new product introductions a major factor in our future success will be our ability to anticipate technological changes and to develop and introduce in a timely manner new products and new ways to deliver them to meet those changes our ability to grow revenue will be dependent on our ability to respond to customer needs in the areas of among others 5g autonomous vehicles iiot and electrification and to leverage cloud computing and new computing platforms in addition our future success may depend on our ability to continue to develop a systems integrator ecosystem able to handle integrations and process and application development to address the challenge of the increasingly complex integration of our products different functionalities to address customers requirements in addition for those customers who authorize a thirdparty technology partner to access their data we do not provide any warranty related to the functionality security and integrity of the data transmission or processing despite contract provisions to protect us customers may look to us to support and provide warranties for the thirdparty applications integrations data and content even though not developed or sold by us which may expose us to potential claims liabilities and obligations all of which could harm our business 

we devote substantial resources to research and development which could cause our operating results to decline 

we devote substantial resources to research and development new competitors technological advances in the software development industry by us or our competitors acquisitions entry into new markets or other competitive factors may require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated if we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated without a corresponding increase in revenue operating results could decline in addition our periodic research and development expenses may be independent of our level of revenue which could negatively impact financial results 

there can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing and marketing on a timely basis new products or product enhancements or that the new products will adequately address the changing needs of the marketplace or that we will successfully manage the transition from existing products software products as complex as those we offer may contain undetected errors defects or vulnerabilities when first introduced or as new versions are released and the likelihood of errors defects or vulnerabilities is increased as a result of our commitment to the frequency of product releases 

there can be no assurance that errors defects or vulnerabilities will not be found in any new or enhanced products after the commencement of commercial shipments the occurrence of any defects or errors in our products could result in lost or delayed market acceptance and sales of our products delays in payment to us by customers loss of customers or market share product returns damage to our reputation diversion of our resources increased service and warranty expenses or financial concessions increased insurance costs and liability for damages 

company operational risks 

we are dependent upon our channel partners for a significant percentage of our revenue and usage of channel partners presents certain heightened compliance risks 

we distribute our products through a global network of independent channel partners which accounted for 237 222 and 229 of our revenue during the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively channel partners sell our software products to new and existing customers expand installations within the existing customer base offer consulting 

table of contents 

services and provide the first line of technical support in the apac and emea regions we are highly dependent upon our channel partners difficulties in ongoing relationships with channel partners such as failure to meet performance criteria and differences in handling customer relationships could adversely affect our performance additionally the loss of any major channel partner including a channel partners decision to sell competing products rather than ours could result in reduced revenue moreover our future success will depend substantially on the ability and willingness of our channel partners to dedicate the resources necessary to understand and promote our expanding portfolio of products and to support a larger installed base within each of our geographic regions if the channel partners are unable or unwilling to do so we may be unable to sustain revenue growth 

we have been increasing the number of our channel partners particularly in international locations the business relationships with many of our channel partners are recently established and could result in additional compliance burdens for us in addition these new channel partners have a lessestablished payment history and revenue from these channel partners could come with a higher rate of bad debt expense where channel partners operate on our behalf to collect and process personal data of customer contacts failure to comply with relevant data privacy laws in the handling of such personal data could result in liability to us for any fines civil suits or nonfinancial performance obligations imposed by regulatory authorities on these partners with respect to our customer data 

certain products require a higher level of sales and support expertise failure of our sales channel particularly the independent channel partners to obtain this expertise and to sell the new product offerings effectively could have an adverse impact on our sales in future periods any of these problems may result in the loss of or delay in customer acceptance diversion of development resources damage to our reputation or increased service and warranty costs any of which could have a significant adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial statements 

we may not be able to realize the potential benefit of our acquisitions and such acquisitions could pose risks to our business 

we acquire businesses and technology to support our longterm strategic direction 

each acquisition that we complete may present risks including difficulty in integrating the management teams strategies cultures and operations of the companies or businesses failing to achieve anticipated synergies revenue increases or cost savings difficulty incorporating and integrating the acquired technologies or products with our existing product lines difficulty with coordinating and integrating sales distribution and marketing functions failure to develop new products and services that utilize the technologies and resources of the companies disruption of our ongoing business and diversion of managements attention to transition or integration issues liabilities that were not identified during the acquisition process the loss of our key employees customers partners and channel partners or those of the acquired companies or businesses and cybersecurity and data privacy risks 

future acquisitions may involve the expenditure of significant cash resources the incurrence of debt which increases our interest expense and leverage or the issuance of equity which is dilutive to stockholders and may decrease earnings per share 

we allocate a portion of the purchase price to goodwill and intangible assets if we do not realize all the economic benefits of an acquisition there could be an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets furthermore impairment charges are generally not taxdeductible and will result in an increased effective income tax rate in the period the impairment is recorded 

if we do not achieve the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by our management or the financial and industry analysts there could be a significant adverse effect on our stock price business and consolidated financial statements 

table of contents 

the ongoing digital transformation of our operational processes may not achieve the benefits identified 

we are in the process of implementing new tools and technology to digitally transform our business while these systems are anticipated to automate and deliver efficiencies across multiple commercial and operational processes within the business there is a risk that the benefits could be substantially delayed there is also a risk that we will have to write off previously capitalized expenditures if the projects are not successful or if implementation decisions regarding the project are modified factors that could further delay the timing of benefits realization include 

• changes in leadership and project objectives 

• additional needs for technical expertise and manpower and 

• longer than anticipated time horizon for employee adoption and mastery 

any of the above could divert efforts of key operational management away from other aspects of the business including the maintenance of current commercial and business platforms and result in increased consulting and software costs these factors could have a significant negative impact on our business and consolidated financial statements 

we may be subject to proceedings that could harm our business 

we are subject to various investigations claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business including commercial disputes labor and employment matters tax audits and litigation alleged infringement of intellectual property rights and other matters use or distribution of our products could generate product liability regulatory infraction or similar claims by our customers end users channel partners government entities or other third parties sales and marketing activities that impact processing of personal data as well as measures taken to ensure license compliance may also result in claims by customers and individual employees of customers each of these matters is subject to various uncertainties and it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could have a significant adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements as well as cause reputational damage 

we may suffer reputational or financial harm if we have product standard or quality issues 

we have separate quality systems and registrations under the iso 90012015 standard in addition to other governmental and industrial regulations our continued compliance with quality standards and favorable outcomes in periodic examinations is important to retain current customers and vital to procure new sales if it was determined that we were not in compliance with various regulatory or iso 9001 standards our certificates of registration could be suspended requiring remedial action and a timeconsuming reregistration process product quality issues or failures could result in our reputation becoming diminished resulting in a material adverse impact on our business and consolidated financial statements 

our shortterm and longterm sales forecast may not be accurate which could result in an adverse impact on our business and consolidated financial statements 

the software business is generally characterized by long sales cycles these long sales cycles increase the difficulty of predicting sales for any particular quarter many operational and strategic decisions are based upon short and longterm sales forecasts our sales personnel continually monitor the status of proposals including the estimated closing date and the value of the sale in order to forecast quarterly sales these forecasts are subject to significant estimation and are impacted by many external factors including global economic conditions and the performance of our customers the heightened uncertainty resulting from the covid19 pandemic results in greater ranges and variability of these forecasts 

a variation in actual sales activity from that forecasted could cause us to plan or budget incorrectly and therefore could have a significant adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial statements management also forecasts macroeconomic trends and developments and integrates them through longrange planning into budgets research and development strategies and a wide variety of general management duties global economic conditions and the effect those conditions and any disruptions in global markets have on our customers may have a significant impact on the accuracy of our sales forecasts these conditions may increase the likelihood or the magnitude of variations between actual sales activity and our sales forecasts and as a result our performance may be hindered because of a failure to properly match corporate strategy with economic conditions this in turn could have a significant adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial statements to the extent our forecasts are incorrect and as a result we fail to meet analyst expectations regarding financial performance or miss or reduce the financial guidance we give to investors our share price may be adversely impacted

intellectual property risks 

our success is highly dependent upon the legal protection of our proprietary technology 

we primarily rely upon contracts copyright patent trademark and trade secrets laws to protect our technology we maintain intellectual property programs including applying for patents registering trademarks and copyrights protecting trade secrets entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees customers and partners and limiting access to and distribution of our software documentation and other proprietary information however software programs are particularly prone to piracy which is a global phenomenon and as a result we may lose revenue from piracy or usage and distribution of unlicensed software additionally patent copyright trademark and trade secret protection do not provide the same coverage in every country in which we sell our products and services and some forms of contractual protections including limited licenses “clickwrapped” licenses and online agreement may not be adequately enforced policing the unauthorized distribution and use of our products is difficult and software piracy including online piracy is a persistent problem while we continue to develop better mechanisms to detect and report or investigate unauthorized use of our software we are also constrained by data privacy laws that restrict our ability to collect data about unlawful usage in some countries we cannot assure that the steps we take to protect our proprietary technology are adequate to prevent misappropriation of our software by third parties or that third parties will not copy our technology or develop similar technology independently to compete with our products despite our efforts to prevent such activities we may nonetheless lose significant revenue due to illegal use of our software or technology 

in the event of a misappropriation of our intellectual property costly and timeconsuming litigation may be necessary to enforce our rights in addition third parties may subject us to infringement claims with respect to their intellectual property rights any such litigation could be costly to defend damage our reputation and distract our employees from their daily work any successful infringement claims asserted against us could require us to develop technology workarounds for the impacted technologies products or solutions which could be costly disrupt product development and delay gotomarket activities such disruption and delay could negatively impact our financial results 

we may not be able to continue to obtain licenses to thirdparty software and intellectual property on reasonable terms or at all which may disrupt our business and harm our financial results 

we license thirdparty software and other intellectual property for use in product research and development and in some instances for inclusion in our products we also license thirdparty software including the software of our competitors to test the interoperability of our products with other industry products and in connection with our solutions and professional services these licenses may need to be renegotiated or renewed from time to time or we may need to obtain new licenses in the future third parties may stop adequately supporting or maintaining their technology or they or their technology may be acquired by our competitors who elect to terminate our contractual relationship we may additionally acquire companies that license thirdparty software from our competitors or others who may elect to terminate the contractual relationship once the acquisition is announced if we are unable to obtain licenses to such thirdparty software and intellectual property on reasonable terms or at all we may not be able to sell the affected products our customers usage of the products may be interrupted or our product development processes and professional services offerings may be disrupted which could in turn harm our financial results our customers ability to utilize our software and our reputation 

cybersecurity risks 

cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue increased costs liability claims or harm to our reputation 

while we undertake commercially reasonable efforts to maintain and improve the security and integrity of our products source code computer systems and data with respect to the relative sensitivity of such software systems and data the number of computer hackers developing and deploying destructive software programs that attack our products and computer systems continues to increase we have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs to enhance our cybersecurity efforts because the tactics and tools used to obtain unauthorized access to networks or to sabotage systems are constantly evolving we may be unable to implement adequate preventive measures such an attack could disrupt the proper functioning of our products cause errors in the output of our customers work or allow unauthorized access to and disclosure of our sensitive proprietary or confidential information or that of our customers and employees in the event of a serious breach of our products or systems or where a breach occurs due to our failure to implement reasonable and appropriate safeguards our reputation may suffer customers may stop buying products or may terminate current services we could face lawsuits and potential civil liability as well as regulatory fines and nonfinancial penalties for any personal data breach and our financial performance could be negatively impacted 

there is also a danger of industrial espionage cyberattacks including statesponsored attacks misuse theft of information or assets including source code or damage to assets by people who have gained unauthorized access to our facilities systems or information we have in the past and may in the future experience such attacks this includes access to systems or information through email phishing attacks on our employees which has become a very prevalent technique used against companies often 

table of contents 

delaying detection through increasingly complex practices the objective of these attacks is often to acquire user account credentials in order to access other computer systems through linked accounts or where users have recycled passwords across systems the attack against solarwinds in 2020 in which hackers inserted malware into a solarwinds software update highlights the growing risk from the infection of software while it is under assembly known as a supply chain attack as a software provider we could become a vector for a similar style attack or could ourselves become the subject of a significant network breach through our usage of compromised thirdparty software similarly subversion of popular opensource modules such as the recently exploited log4j vulnerability represents a widespread and ongoing risk across the software development sector 

inadequate security practices or inadvertent acts or omissions by our employees and partners may also result in unauthorized access to our data employees or third parties may also intentionally compromise our or our customers security or systems such cybersecurity breaches misuse of data or other disruptions could lead to loss of or unauthorized disclosure of our source code or other confidential information unlicensed use and distribution of our products without compensation illegal use of our products that could jeopardize the security of customer information stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and theft manipulation and destruction of proprietary data resulting in defective products performance downtimes and possible violation of export laws and other regulatory compliance requirements although we actively employ measures to combat such activities preventing unauthorized access to our systems and data is inherently difficult in addition litigation to either pursue our legal rights or defend any claims against us could be costly and timeconsuming and may divert managements attention and adversely affect the markets perception of us and our products 

we have experienced targeted and nontargeted cybersecurity attacks and incidents in the past that have resulted in unauthorized persons gaining access to our information and systems and we could in the future experience similar attacks to date no cybersecurity incident or attack described herein has had a material impact on our business or consolidated financial statements 

a number of our core processes such as software development sales and marketing customer service and financial transactions rely on it infrastructure and applications we also rely on thirdparty service providers and products which are exposed to various security vulnerabilities outside of our control malicious software sabotage and other cybersecurity breaches of the types discussed above could cause an outage of our infrastructure which could cause shortterm disruption in operations or in the event of a longer disruption lead to a substantial denial of service to our customers and ultimately to production downtime recovery costs and customer claims for breach of contract as well as reputational damage and impact to employee morale and productivity 

we rely on service providers for infrastructure and cloudbased products 

we use a number of thirdparty service providers which we do not control for key components of our infrastructure particularly with respect to development and delivery of our cloudbased products the utilization of these service providers gives us greater flexibility in efficiently delivering a more tailored scalable customer experience but also exposes us to additional risks and vulnerabilities thirdparty service providers operate their own platforms that we access and we are therefore vulnerable to their service interruptions we may experience interruptions delays and outages in service and availability from time to time as a result of problems with our thirdparty service providers infrastructure lack of availability of this infrastructure could be due to a number of potential causes including technical failures natural disasters including significant disruptions in weather as a result of global climate change fraud or security attacks that we cannot predict or prevent such outages could lead to the triggering of our service level agreements and the issuance of credits to our cloudbased product customers which may impact our business and consolidated financial statements in addition those of our products and services that depend upon hosted components are vulnerable to security risks inherent in webbased technologies including greater risk of unauthorized access to or use of customers protected data interception of data transmission misappropriation or modification of data corruption of data and attacks by bad actors against our service providers may also adversely affect our products or product and service delivery malicious code viruses or vulnerabilities that are undetected by our service providers may disrupt our business operations generally and may have a disproportionate effect on those of our products that are developed and delivered in the cloud environment if our security or that of any of our thirdparty service providers is compromised our software is unavailable or our customers are unable to use our software within a reasonable amount of time or at all then our business and financial statements could be adversely affected 

these risks though largely outside our control may impact customer perception of our products service and support and may damage our brand while we devote resources to maintaining the security and integrity of our products and systems as well as ensuring adequate due diligence for our thirdparty service providers cloud security and reliability is inherently challenging in the event of a material breach of data hosted by our service providers or a serious security incident on behalf of caused by or experienced by a service provider we may experience significant operational and technical difficulties loss of data including customer data diminished competitive position or reputation and loss of customer engagement which could result in civil 

table of contents 

liabilities and a negative impact to financial performance it is also possible that our customers and potential customers would hold us accountable for any breach of security affecting a thirdparty service providers infrastructure and we may incur significant liability from those customers and from third parties with respect to any breach affecting these systems we may not be able to recover a material portion of our liabilities to our customers and third parties from a thirdparty cloud provider 

financial risks 

foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect our consolidated financial statements 

as a result of our significant international presence we have revenue expenses cash accounts receivable and payment obligations denominated in foreign currencies most notably the euro and japanese yen our operating results are adversely affected when the us dollar strengthens relative to foreign currencies and are positively affected when the us dollar weakens relative to foreign currencies when the us dollar strengthens relative to other currencies certain channel partners who pay us in us dollars may have trouble paying on time or may have trouble distributing our products due to the impact of the currency exchange fluctuation on their cash flows this may impact our ability to distribute our products into certain regions and markets 

we seek to reduce our currency exchange transaction risks primarily through our normal operating and treasury activities including derivative instruments but there can be no assurance that these activities will be successful in reducing these risks in addition we incur transaction fees in the usage of such derivative instruments changes in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our consolidated financial statements 

changes to tax laws variable tax estimates and tax authority audits could impact our financial results and operations 

our operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the us and in multiple foreign jurisdictions a change in the tax law in the jurisdictions in which we do business including an increase in tax rates an adverse change in the treatment of an item of income or expense or a decrease in tax rates in a jurisdiction in which we have significant deferred tax assets could result in a material increase in tax expense furthermore we have recorded significant deferred tax liabilities related to acquired intangible assets that are not deductible for tax purposes these deferred tax liabilities are based on future statutory tax rates in the locations in which the intangible assets are recorded any future changes in statutory tax rates would be recorded as an adjustment to the deferred tax liabilities in the period the change is announced and could have a material impact on our effective tax rate during that period additionally changes in tax laws could impact operating cash flow due to changes in timing of payments required as well as the overall rate we are required to pay 

we also make significant estimates in determining our worldwide income tax provision these estimates involve complex tax regulations in many jurisdictions and are subject to many transactions and calculations in which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain the outcome of tax matters could be different than the estimates reflected in the historical income tax provision and related accruals such differences could have a material impact on income tax expense and net income in the periods in which such determinations are made 

the amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities these audits can result in additional assessments including interest and penalties our estimates for liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions are highly judgmental and actual future outcomes may result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities including estimates for uncertain tax positions in the period the assessments are made or resolved audits are closed or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire as a result our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly or annual basis 

our indebtedness could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in connection with our acquisitions of agi and lst we have outstanding borrowings of 3560 million and 3990 million respectively under term loan facilities which mature on november 1 2024 we also have access to a 5000 million revolving credit facility which includes a 500 million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit the credit agreements governing these loans contain customary representations and warranties affirmative and negative covenants and events of default the credit agreements also contain a financial covenant requiring us to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of indebtedness to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization not exceeding 350 to 100 as of the end of any fiscal quarter for the fourquarter period ending on such date with an opportunity for a temporary increase in such consolidated leverage ratio to 400 to 100 upon the consummation of certain qualified acquisitions for which the aggregate consideration is at least 2500 million 

notwithstanding the limits contained in the credit agreements governing our term loan facilities and credit facility we may be able to incur substantial additional debt from time to time to finance working capital capital expenditures share repurchases 

table of contents 

investments or acquisitions or for other purposes if we do so the risks related to our level of debt could intensify specifically our level of debt could 

• make it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations and other ongoing business obligations which may result in defaults 

• result in an event of default if we fail to comply with the financial and other covenants contained in the agreement governing our debt which could result in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable or require us to negotiate an amendment to financial or other covenants that could cause us to incur additional fees and expenses 

• limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or other general corporate requirements 

• reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and other general corporate purposes 

• increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions 

• expose us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings including borrowings under the credit facility are at variable rates of interest 

• limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to and increasing our vulnerability to changes in our business the industries in which we operate and the overall economy 

• place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to other less leveraged competitors 

• increase our cost of borrowing and 

• increase our effective tax rate as interest expense could become nondeductible 

any of the abovelisted factors could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt agreements 

furthermore borrowings under the credit agreement use the london interbank offering rate libor as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate libor has been the subject of national international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform and the financial industry is currently transitioning away from libor as a benchmark for the interbank lending market on march 5 2021 the intercontinental exchange benchmark administration the uk financial conduct authority fca regulated and authorized administrator of libor announced and the fca confirmed that the us dollar libor panel for all tenors will cease on june 30 2023 when libor is eliminated our borrowings will default to the base rate that is historically higher and we may not be able to renegotiate to a more favorable rate that more closely approximates libor and could experience an increase in the cost of our variable rate indebtedness

overall gaap and nongaap results 

this section includes a discussion of gaap and nongaap results for reconciliations of nongaap results to gaap results see the section titled nongaap results herein 

the nongaap results exclude the income statement effects of the acquisition accounting adjustments to deferred revenue stockbased compensation excess payroll taxes related to stockbased compensation amortization of acquired intangible assets transaction expenses related to business combinations and adjustments for the income tax effect of the excluded items 

this section also includes a discussion of constant currency results which we use for financial and operational decisionmaking and as a means to evaluate periodtoperiod comparisons by excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on the reported results constant currency is a nongaap measure all constant currency results presented in this item 7 exclude the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on the reported results to present this information the 2021 results for entities whose functional currency is a currency other than the us dollar were converted to us dollars at rates that were in effect for the 2020 comparable period rather than the actual exchange rates in effect for 2021 constant currency growth rates are calculated by adjusting the 2021 reported revenue and operating income amounts by the 2021 currency fluctuation impacts and comparing to the 2020 comparable period reported revenue and operating income amounts 

our gaap and nongaap results for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 reflected the following variances 



our results reflect an increase in revenue during the year ended december 31 2021 due to growth across all revenue streams driven by strong execution acquisitions and by the improving global economic environment in 2021 as compared to 2020 we 

table of contents 

also experienced increased operating expenses during the year ended december 31 2021 primarily due to increased personnel costs additional operating expenses related to acquisitions and higher stockbased compensation the covid19 pandemic did not have a material impact on our operating expenses during the year ended december 31 2021 

impact of foreign currency 

our comparative financial results were impacted by fluctuations in the us dollar during the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 the impacts on our gaap and nongaap revenue and operating income as a result of the fluctuations of the us dollar when measured against our primary foreign currencies are reflected in the table below amounts in brackets indicate an adverse impact from currency fluctuations 



although exchange rates had a favorable impact on revenue for the year the impact on operating income was negative driven primarily by the significant strengthening in the fourth quarter of the us dollar against the euro as compared to the same quarter in the prior year the currency impacts were further amplified in operating income as the fourth quarter also represents the emea regions most significant sales period and correspondingly its largest margin 

in constant currency our variances were as follows 



other key business metric 

annual contract value acv is one of our key performance metrics and is useful to investors in assessing the strength and trajectory of our business given that revenue is more volatile due to the upfront revenue recognition of perpetual licenses and multiyear lease license sales we provide acv as a supplemental metric to help evaluate the annual performance of the business summed over the long term acv and revenue are equal however there will be years in which acv growth lags revenue growth and other years in which acv growth leads revenue growth it is used by management in financial and operational decisionmaking and in setting sales targets used for compensation acv should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue as acv is a performance metric and is not intended to be combined with any of these items there is no gaap measure comparable to acv acv is composed of the following 

• the annualized value of maintenance and lease contracts with start dates or anniversary dates during the period plus 

• the value of perpetual license contracts with start dates during the period plus 

• the annualized value of fixedterm services contracts with start dates or anniversary dates during the period plus 

• the value of work performed during the period on fixeddeliverable services contracts 

our acv was as follows 



recurring acv includes both lease licenses and maintenance contracts the reduction as a percentage of total acv in 2021 as compared to 2020 was driven by an increase in perpetual licensing due to lower perpetual sales during the pandemic in 2020 

table of contents 

industry commentary 

for 2021 acv growth was broad based across core industries hightech aerospace and defense ad and automotive our three largest industries experienced strong growth in 2021 as companies continued investing in simulation to reduce costs and development time the hightech industry growth was driven by 5g increasingly complex electronics systems and chip designs and highperformance computing demands spurred by remote work requirements despite the ad industry continuing to feel impacts from the pandemic demand for our core and new and emerging technology segments including simulation data management safetycritcal embedded controls and mission planning contributed to growth in the industry our continued growth in the automotive industry illustrates the industry’s need for a complete multiphysics simulation portfolio to overcome complex engineering challenges while electrification autonomous technology and connectivity serve as strong tailwinds sustainability engineering digitalization and electrification initiatives are driving growth in the industrial equipment and energy industries we also saw robust growth in the healthcare space as insilico medicine becomes more prevalent  

geographic trends 

the following table presents our gaap and nongaap geographic revenue variances using actual and constant currency rates during the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 



to drive growth we continue to focus on a number of sales improvement activities across the geographic regions including sales hiring pipeline building productivity initiatives and customer engagement activities 

despite the overall strong performance in the broader asiapacific region continued trade restrictions between the us and china have had an impact on and in the future may further restrict our ability to sell and distribute our products to certain customers as a result this as well as other potential trade restrictions with other countries could continue to have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition refer to additional details in risk factors under part i item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

acquisitions 

we make targeted acquisitions in order to support our longterm strategic direction accelerate innovation provide increased capabilities to our existing products supply new products and services expand our customer base and enhance our distribution channels our recent acquisitions included the following

year ended december 31 2021 compared to year ended december 31 2020 

revenue 



revenue for the year ended december 31 2021 increased 134 compared to the year ended december 31 2020 or 132 in constant currency the growth rate was favorably impacted by our continued investments in our global sales support and marketing organizations the timing and duration of our multiyear lease contracts strong perpetual license sales off a relatively lower 2020 compare sales to our small and mediumsized businesses and our recent acquisitions lease license revenue increased 235 or 249 in constant currency as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 perpetual license revenue which is derived from new sales during the year ended december 31 2021 increased 169 or 163 in constant currency as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 service revenue increased 84 or 74 in constant currency as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 annual maintenance contracts that were sold with new perpetual licenses maintenance contracts for new perpetual licenses sold in previous years maintenance renewals and the maintenance portion of lease license contracts collectively contributed to maintenance revenue growth of 66 or 56 in constant currency 

with respect to revenue on average for the year ended december 31 2021 the us dollar was 04 weaker when measured against our primary foreign currencies than for the year ended december 31 2020 the table below presents the net impacts of currency fluctuations on revenue for the year ended december 31 2021 amounts in brackets indicate a net adverse impact from currency fluctuations 



the impacts from currency fluctuations resulted in decreased operating income of 107 million for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 

table of contents 

as a percentage of revenue our international and domestic revenues and our direct and indirect revenues were as follows 



in valuing deferred revenue on the balance sheets of our recent acquisitions as of their respective acquisition dates we applied the fair value provisions applicable to the accounting for business combinations resulting in a reduction of deferred revenue as compared to the historical carrying amount as a result our postacquisition revenue will be less than the sum of what would have otherwise been reported by us and each acquiree absent the acquisitions the impacts on reported revenue were 248 million and 142 million for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively the expected impacts on reported revenue are 34 million and 74 million for the quarter ending march 31 2022 and the year ending december 31 2022 respectively 

cost of sales and operating expenses 

the tables below reflect our operating results on both a gaap and constant currency basis amounts included in the discussions that follow each table are provided in constant currency and are inclusive of costs related to our acquisitions the impact of foreign exchange translation is discussed separately where material 



software licenses the increase in the cost of software licenses was primarily due to increased thirdparty royalties of 72 million 

amortization the increase in amortization expense was primarily due to the amortization of newly acquired intangible assets 

maintenance and service the net increase in maintenance and service costs was primarily due to the following 

• increased salaries and incentive compensation of 31 million 

• increased costs related to foreign exchange translation of 23 million due to a weaker us dollar 

• increased it maintenance and software hosting costs of 16 million 

• decreased thirdparty technical support of 18 million 

the improvement in gross profit was a result of the increase in revenue partially offset by the increase in the cost of 

sales 

table of contents 



selling general and administrative the net increase in selling general and administrative costs was primarily due to the following 

• increased salaries incentive compensation and other headcountrelated costs of 892 million 

• increased stockbased compensation of 183 million 

• increased consulting costs of 90 million 

• increased it maintenance and software hosting costs of 72 million 

• increased costs related to foreign exchange translation of 61 million due to a weaker us dollar 

• decreased bad debt expense of 54 million 

we anticipate that we will continue to make targeted investments in our global sales and marketing organizations and our global business infrastructure to enhance and support our revenuegenerating activities 

research and development the increase in research and development costs was primarily due to the following 

• increased salaries incentive compensation and other headcountrelated costs of 316 million 

• increased it maintenance and software hosting costs of 55 million 

• increased costs related to foreign exchange translation of 50 million due to a weaker us dollar 

• increased stockbased compensation of 37 million 

amortization the net decrease in amortization expense was primarily due to a decrease in the amortization of customer lists due to assets that became fully amortized which was partially offset by the amortization of newly acquired intangible assets 

we have traditionally invested significant resources in research and development activities and intend to continue to make investments in expanding the ease of use and capabilities of our broad portfolio of simulation software products 

interest income interest income for the year ended december 31 2021 was 21 million as compared to 51 million for the year ended december 31 2020 interest income decreased as a result of a lower interest rate environment and the related decrease in the average rate of return on invested cash balances 

interest expense interest expense for the year ended december 31 2021 was 124 million as compared to 110 million for the year ended december 31 2020 interest expense increased as a result of interest incurred on debt financing obtained in connection with the acquisition of agi in the fourth quarter of 2020 partially offset by a lower interest rate environment 

table of contents 

other income net our other income consisted of the following 



income tax provision our income before income tax provision income tax provision and effective tax rate were as follows 



the decrease in the effective tax rate from the prior year was primarily due to increased tax benefits of 79 million related to stockbased compensation deductions and 70 million related to foreignderived intangible income fdii deductions these benefits were partially offset by an increase in nondeductible compensation of 110 million 

when compared to the federal and state combined statutory rate for each respective period the effective tax rates for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 were favorably impacted by tax benefits from stockbased compensation the fdii deduction and research and development credits partially offset by the impact of nondeductible compensation

we use nongaap financial measures a to evaluate our historical and prospective financial performance as well as our performance relative to our competitors b to set internal sales targets and spending budgets c to allocate resources d to measure operational profitability and the accuracy of forecasting e to assess financial discipline over operational expenditures and f as an important factor in determining variable compensation for management and employees in addition many financial analysts that follow us focus on and publish both historical results and future projections based on nongaap financial measures we believe that it is in the best interest of our investors to provide this information to analysts so that they accurately report the nongaap financial information moreover investors have historically requested and we have historically reported these nongaap financial measures as a means of providing consistent and comparable information with past reports of financial results 

while we believe that these nongaap financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors there are limitations associated with the use of these nongaap financial measures these nongaap financial measures are not prepared in accordance with gaap are not reported by all our competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of our competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation we compensate for these limitations by using these nongaap financial measures as supplements to gaap financial measures and by reviewing the reconciliations of the nongaap financial measures to their most comparable gaap financial measures 

the adjustments to these nongaap financial measures and the basis for such adjustments are outlined below 

acquisition accounting for deferred revenue historically we have consummated acquisitions in order to support our strategic and other business objectives in accordance with the fair value provisions applicable to the accounting for business combinations acquired deferred revenue is often recorded on the opening balance sheet at an amount that is lower than the historical carrying value although this acquisition accounting requirement has no impact on our business or cash flow it adversely impacts our reported gaap revenue in the reporting periods following an acquisition in order to provide investors with financial information that facilitates comparison of both historical and future results we provide nongaap financial measures which exclude the impact of the acquisition accounting adjustment we believe that this nongaap financial adjustment is useful to investors because it allows investors to a evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by us in our financial and operational decisionmaking and b compare our past and future reports of financial results as the revenue reduction related to acquired deferred revenue will not recur when related lease licenses and software maintenance contracts are renewed in future periods 

amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions we incur amortization of intangible assets included in our gaap presentation of amortization expense related to various acquisitions we have made we exclude these expenses for the purpose of calculating nongaap gross profit nongaap gross profit margin nongaap operating income nongaap operating profit margin nongaap net income and nongaap diluted earnings per share when we evaluate our continuing operational performance because these costs are fixed at the time of an acquisition are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by us after the acquisition accordingly we do not consider these expenses for purposes of evaluating our performance during the applicable time period after the acquisition and we exclude such expenses when making decisions to allocate resources we believe that these nongaap financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to a evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by us in our financial and operational decisionmaking and b compare our past reports of financial results as we have historically reported these nongaap financial measures 

stockbased compensation expense  we incur expense related to stockbased compensation included in our gaap presentation of cost of maintenance and service research and development expense and selling general and administrative expense this nongaap adjustment also includes excess payroll tax expense related to stockbased compensation stockbased compensation expense benefit incurred in connection with our deferred compensation plan held in a rabbi trust includes an offsetting benefit charge recorded in other income expense although stockbased compensation is an expense and viewed as a form of compensation we exclude these expenses for the purpose of calculating nongaap gross profit nongaap gross profit margin nongaap operating income nongaap operating profit margin nongaap net income and nongaap diluted earnings per share when we evaluate our continuing operational performance we similarly exclude income expense related to assets held in a rabbi trust in connection with our deferred compensation plan specifically we exclude stockbased compensation and income expense related to assets held in the deferred compensation plan rabbi trust during our annual budgeting process and our quarterly and annual assessments of our performance the annual budgeting process is the primary mechanism whereby we allocate resources to various initiatives and operational requirements additionally the annual review by our board of directors during which it compares our historical business model and profitability to the planned business model and profitability for the forthcoming year excludes the impact of stockbased compensation in evaluating the performance of our senior management and department managers charges related to stockbased compensation are excluded from expenditure and profitability results in fact we record stockbased compensation expense into a standalone cost center for which no single operational manager is responsible or accountable in this way we can review on a periodtoperiod basis

transaction expenses related to business combinations we incur expenses for professional services rendered in connection with business combinations which are included in our gaap presentation of selling general and administrative expense these expenses are generally not taxdeductible we exclude these acquisitionrelated transaction expenses derived from announced acquisitions for the purpose of calculating nongaap operating income nongaap operating profit margin nongaap net income and nongaap diluted earnings per share when we evaluate our continuing operational performance as we generally would not have otherwise incurred these expenses in the periods presented as a part of our operations we believe that these nongaap financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to a evaluate our operating results and the effectiveness of the methodology used by us to review our operating results and b review historical comparability in our financial reporting as well as comparability with competitors operating results 

nongaap tax provision we utilize a normalized nongaap annual effective tax rate aetr to calculate nongaap measures this methodology provides better consistency across interim reporting periods by eliminating the effects of nonrecurring items and aligning the nongaap tax rate with our expected geographic earnings mix to project this rate we analyzed our historic and projected nongaap earnings mix by geography along with other factors such as our current tax structure recurring tax credits and incentives and expected tax positions on an annual basis we will reevaluate this rate for significant items that may materially affect our projections 

nongaap financial measures are not in accordance with or an alternative for gaap our nongaap financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable gaap financial measures and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap 

we have provided a reconciliation of the nongaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures as listed below 



constant currency in addition to the nongaap financial measures detailed above we use constant currency results for financial and operational decisionmaking and as a means to evaluate periodtoperiod comparisons by excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on the reported results to present this information the 2021 results for entities whose functional currency is a currency other than the us dollar were converted to us dollars at rates that were in effect for the 2020 comparable period rather than the actual exchange rates in effect for 2021 constant currency growth rates are calculated by adjusting the 2021 reported amounts by the 2021 currency fluctuation impacts and comparing the adjusted amounts to the 2020 comparable period reported amounts we believe that these nongaap financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to a evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by us in our financial and operational decisionmaking and b compare our reported results to our past reports of financial results without the effects of foreign currency fluctuations

liquidity and capital resources 



cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of highly liquid investments such as money market funds and deposits held at major banks shortterm investments consist primarily of deposits held by certain of our foreign subsidiaries with original maturities of three months to one year the following table presents our foreign and domestic holdings of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments 



in general it is our intention to permanently reinvest all earnings in excess of previously taxed amounts substantially all of the pre2018 earnings of our nonus subsidiaries were taxed through the transition tax and post2018 current earnings are taxed as part of global intangible lowtaxed income tax expense these taxes increase our previously taxed earnings and allow for the repatriation of the majority of our foreign earnings without any residual us federal tax while we believe that the financial reporting bases may be greater than the tax bases of investments in foreign subsidiaries for any earnings in excess of previously taxed amounts such amounts are considered permanently reinvested the cumulative temporary difference related to such permanently reinvested earnings is 700 million and we would anticipate the tax effect on those earnings to be immaterial 

the amount of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments held by foreign subsidiaries is subject to translation adjustments caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period the offset to which is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet 

cash flows from operating activities 



net cash provided by operating activities increased during the current fiscal year due to increased net income net of noncash operating adjustments of 407 million partially offset by decreased net cash flows from operating assets and liabilities of 385 million 

cash flows from investing activities 



net cash used in investing activities decreased during the current fiscal year due primarily to decreased acquisitionrelated net cash outlays of 615 million and decreased capital expenditures of 124 million we currently plan capital spending of 250 million to 350 million during fiscal year 2022 as compared to the 230 million that was spent in fiscal year 2021 the level of spending will depend on various factors including the growth of the business and general economic conditions 

table of contents 

cash flows from financing activities 



net cash used in financing activities increased during the current fiscal year due primarily to 3750 million in proceeds from longterm debt obtained in fiscal year 2020 related to the agi acquisition and increased restricted stock withholding taxes paid in lieu of issuing shares of 260 million partially offset by decreased principal payments on longterm debt of 300 million and decreased stock repurchases of 264 million 

other cash flow information 

as of december 31 2021 the carrying value of our term loans was 7536 million with no principal payments due in the next twelve months borrowings under the term loans accrue interest at the eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin or at the base rate at our election the base rate is the applicable margin plus the highest of i the federal funds rate plus 0500 ii the bank of america prime rate and iii the eurodollar rate plus 1000 the applicable margin for these borrowings is a percentage per annum based on the lower of 1 a pricing level determined by our thencurrent consolidated leverage ratio and 2 a pricing level determined by our debt ratings if such debt ratings exist 

we previously entered into operating lease commitments primarily for our domestic and international offices the commitments related to these operating leases is 1418 million of which 259 million is due in the next twelve months 

we believe that existing cash and cash equivalent balances together with cash generated from operations and access to the 5000 million revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements through the next twelve months our cash requirements in the future may also be financed through additional equity or debt financings however future disruptions in the capital markets could make financing more challenging and there can be no assurance that such financing can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

under our stock repurchase program we repurchased shares as follows 



as of december 31 2021 25 million shares remained available for repurchase under the program 

the authorized repurchase program does not have an expiration date and the pace of the repurchase activity will depend on factors such as working capital needs cash requirements for acquisitions our stock price and economic and market conditions our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases or pursuant to a rule 10b51 plan 

we continue to generate positive cash flows from operating activities and believe that the best uses of our excess cash are to invest in the business acquire or make investments in complementary companies products services and technologies and make payments on our outstanding debt balances any future acquisitions may be funded by available cash and investments cash generated from operations debt financing or the issuance of additional securities additionally we have in the past and expect in the future to repurchase stock in order to both offset dilution and return capital in excess of our requirements to stockholders with the goal of increasing stockholder value

contractual and other obligations 

our significant contractual and other obligations as of december 31 2021 are summarized below 



1 borrowings under the longterm debt accrue interest at the eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin or at the base rate at our election the base rate is the applicable margin plus the highest of i the federal funds rate plus 0500 ii the bank of america prime rate and iii the eurodollar rate plus 1000 the applicable margin for these borrowings is a percentage per annum based on the lower of 1 a pricing level determined by our thencurrent consolidated leverage ratio and 2 a pricing level determined by our debt ratings if such debt ratings exist as the interest rate is variable interest on the longterm debt is estimated using the interest rate as of december 31 2021 for additional information see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k 

2 we previously entered into a lease agreement for 186000 square feet of rentable space located in an office facility in canonsburg pennsylvania which serves as our headquarters the term of the lease is 183 months beginning on october 1 2014 and expiring on december 31 2029 we have a onetime right to terminate the lease on december 31 2025 by providing the landlord with at least 18 months prior written notice of such termination 

3 other operating leases primarily include lease commitments for our other domestic and international offices as well as certain operating equipment 

4 unconditional purchase obligations primarily include minimum royalty contracts software licenses and support and network services which are unrecorded as of december 31 2021 the unconditional purchase obligations are in addition to the current and longterm liabilities recorded on our december 31 2021 consolidated balance sheet 

5 we have 498 million of unrecognized tax benefits including estimated interest and penalties that have been recorded as liabilities in accordance with income tax accounting guidance for which we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled as a result such amounts are excluded from the table above

critical accounting estimates 

we have prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap in preparing our consolidated financial statements we make assumptions judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations these estimates assumptions and judgments are made based on our historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could materially differ from any of our estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

the accounting policies methods and estimates used to prepare our consolidated financial statements are described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k the most critical accounting judgments and estimates that we made in preparing our consolidated financial statements involved 

• revenue recognition 

• valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations and 

• income taxes 

revenue recognition 

description 

our revenue is derived principally from the licensing of computer software products and from related maintenance contracts we enter into contracts that include combinations of products maintenance and services which are accounted for as separate performance obligations with differing revenue recognition patterns 

judgments and estimates 

our contracts with customers typically include promises to transfer licenses and services to a customer judgment is required to determine if the promises are separate performance obligations and if so to allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation we use the estimated standalone selling price method to allocate the transaction price for each performance obligation the estimated standalone selling price is determined using all information reasonably available to us including market conditions and other observable inputs the corresponding revenues are recognized as the related performance obligations are satisfied 

our timebased lease tbl license contracts with customers are sold as a bundled arrangement that includes the rights to a term software license as well as postcontract support pcs revenue is recognized up front at the commencement of the lease for the term software license and recognized ratably over the term of the contract for the pcs in the arrangement utilizing observable inputs we determined that 50 of the estimated standalone selling price of the tbl is attributable to the term software license while 50 is attributable to pcs this determination involved judgment particularly as it relates to the value relationship between our pcs and tbls the value relationship between pcs and our perpetual licenses and its linkage to the shortened term of a tbl the average economic life of our software renewal rates of our customers and the price of the bundled arrangement in relation to the perpetual licensing approach 

changes in these estimates could significantly impact the recognition of revenue in a given period 

valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations 

description 

in accordance with business combination accounting we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date based upon their estimated fair values the excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired if any is recorded as goodwill intangible assets are recognized apart from goodwill whenever an acquired intangible asset arises from contractual or other legal rights or whenever it is capable of being separated or divided from the acquired entity and sold transferred licensed rented or exchanged either individually or in combination with a related contract asset or liability 

table of contents 

judgments and estimates 

determining these fair values requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions particularly with respect to acquired intangible assets we determined the fair value of our intangible assets using various valuation techniques including the relieffromroyalty method and the multiperiod excess earnings method these models utilize certain unobservable inputs classified as level 3 measurements as defined by asc 820 fair value measurements and disclosures  the determination of fair value requires considerable judgment and is sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions estimates and market factors estimating fair value requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans as well as industry and economic conditions these assumptions and estimates include but are not limited to royalty rate discount rate and customer attrition rate the fair values of the intangible assets will be amortized over their useful lives 

if actual results are materially different than the assumptions we used to determine fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed through a business combination it is possible that adjustments to the carrying values of such assets and liabilities will have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations see note 4 to to the consolidated financial statements included in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for information regarding our business acquisitions 

income taxes 

description 

our income tax expense reflects managements best estimate of current and future taxes to be paid we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period of the enactment date 

additionally as part of our accounting for income taxes tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a morelikelythannot threshold otherwise these tax benefits are recorded when a tax position has been effectively settled which means that the statute of limitations has expired or the appropriate taxing authority has completed its examination even though the statute of limitations remains open 

judgments and estimates 

we are subject to tax in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgements and estimates are required in the determination of consolidated income tax expense we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized in making such determination we consider all available positive and negative evidence including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and recent financial operations the assumptions about future taxable income require the use of significant judgement and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business in the event we determine that we will be able to realize deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance was used to reduce their carrying value the adjustment to the valuation allowance will be recorded as a reduction to the provision for income taxes in the period such determination is made 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations significant judgment is required in the identification and measurement of uncertain tax positions our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because we are required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions we adjust the liabilities when our judgement changes as a result of new information not previously available 

although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material to the extent actual results differ from estimated amounts recorded such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which the determination is made

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk  changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest income that is generated from our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments and the interest expense that is generated from our outstanding borrowings for the year ended december 31 2021 interest income was 21 million and interest expense was 124 million 

cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of highly liquid investments such as money market funds and deposits held at major banks shortterm investments consist primarily of deposits held by certain foreign subsidiaries with original maturities of three months to one year a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates on these holdings would have an immaterial impact on our interest income 

our outstanding borrowings of 7550 million as of december 31 2021 accrue interest at the eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin or at the base rate at our election the base rate is the applicable margin plus the highest of i the federal funds rate plus 0500 ii the bank of america prime rate and iii the eurodollar rate plus 1000 the applicable margin for these borrowings is a percentage per annum based on the lower of 1 a pricing level determined by our thencurrent consolidated leverage ratio and 2 a pricing level determined by our debt ratings if such debt ratings exist this results in a margin ranging from 1125 to 1750 and 0125 to 0750 for the eurodollar rate and base rate respectively because interest rates applicable to the outstanding borrowings are variable we are exposed to interest rate risk from changes in the underlying index rates which affects our interest expense a hypothetical increase of 100 basis points in interest rates would result in an increase in interest expense and a corresponding decrease in cash flows of 76 million over the next twelve months based on outstanding borrowings at december 31 2021 

foreign currency transaction risk as we operate in international regions a portion of our revenue expenses cash accounts receivable and payment obligations are denominated in foreign currencies as a result changes in currency exchange rates will affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

with respect to revenue on average for the year ended december 31 2021 the us dollar was 04 weaker when measured against our primary foreign currencies than for the year ended december 31 2020 the table below presents the net impacts of currency fluctuations on revenue for the year ended december 31 2021 amounts in brackets indicate a net adverse impact from currency fluctuations 



the impacts from currency fluctuations resulted in decreased operating income of 107 million for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 

a hypothetical 10 strengthening in the us dollar against other currencies would have decreased our revenue by 803 million and decreased our operating income by 363 million for the year ended december 31 2021 we seek to reduce our currency exchange transaction risks primarily through our normal operating and treasury activities including the use of derivative instruments

proprietary rights and licenses 

we regard our software as proprietary and rely on a combination of trade secret copyright patent and trademark laws license agreements nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights in our products we distribute our software products under software license agreements that predominantly grant customers nonexclusive licenses which are typically nontransferable for the use of our products license agreements for our products are generally directly between us and end users use of the licensed software product is restricted to specified sites unless the customer obtains a multisite license for its use of the software product or the software product is by its nature a multisite use product software security measures are also employed to prevent unauthorized use of our software products and the licensed software is subject to terms and conditions prohibiting unauthorized use distribution or reproduction for most products customers may purchase a perpetual license of the technology with the right to annually purchase ongoing maintenance technical support and upgrades or may lease the product on a fixedterm basis for a fee that includes the license maintenance technical support and upgrades for some products customers purchase an annual subscription for a certain number of named users that includes the license maintenance technical support and upgrades or purchase elastic units which enable the use of any supported product at any time until their licensed volume is met 

we license our software products utilizing a combination of webbased and hardcopy license terms and forms for certain software products we primarily rely on clickwrapped licenses ie online agreements where the website provider posts terms and conditions and the user clicks on the accept button the enforceability of these types of agreements under the laws of some jurisdictions is uncertain 

we also seek to protect the source code of our software as a trade secret and as registered unpublished copyrighted work we have obtained federal trademark registration protection for ansys and other marks in the us and foreign countries additionally we were awarded numerous patents by the us patent and trademark office or equivalent offices in other jurisdictions and have a number of patent applications pending to the extent we do not choose to seek patent protection for our intellectual property we primarily rely on the protection of our source code as a trade secret 

our employees have signed agreements under which they have agreed not to disclose trade secrets or confidential information these agreements where legally permitted restrict engagement in or connection with any business that is competitive with us anywhere in the world while employed by us and in some cases for specified periods thereafter and state that any products or technology created by employees during their term of employment are our property in addition we require all channel partners to enter into agreements not to disclose our trade secrets and other proprietary information 

despite these precautions there can be no assurance that misappropriation of our technology and proprietary information including source code will be prevented further there can be no assurance that copyright trademark patent and trade secret protection will be available for our products in certain jurisdictions or that restrictions on the ability of employees and channel partners to engage in activities competitive with us will be enforceable costly and timeconsuming litigation could be necessary in the future to enforce our rights to our trade secrets and proprietary information or to enforce our patent rights and copyrights and it is possible that in the future our competitors may be able to obtain our trade secrets or to independently develop similar technology 

the software development industry is characterized by rapid technological change therefore we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel new product developments frequent product enhancements name recognition and reliable product maintenance are also important to establishing and maintaining technology leadership in addition to the various available legal protections of our technology 

we do not believe that any of our products infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties there can be no assurance however that third parties will not claim such infringement by us or our licensors or licensees with respect to current or future products in addition there are nonpracticing entities npes and patent assertion entities paes whose business models are built on not producing any products but rather extracting payments from revenuegenerating companies through patent infringement assertions andor litigation we expect that software suppliers will increasingly be subject to the risk of such claims as the number of products and suppliers continues to expand and the functionality of products continues to increase any such claims with or without merit could be time consuming result in costly litigation cause product release delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements such royalty or licensing agreements if required may not be available on terms acceptable to us

employee recruitment development and retention 

our talent strategy is focused on i attracting diverse highquality talent ii continually developing and engaging our employee base and iii retaining our people by recognizing and rewarding performance our commitment to recruiting diverse talent is evidenced in the united states through our dedication to increasing recruiting efforts at historically black colleges and universities as well as our involvement with minority engineering societies women in technology groups veterans’ organizations and lgbtqa organizations in addition to targeted outreach we recruit talent through i attending career and networking events aimed towards recruiting diverse audiences ii hiring internally through our ansys internshipcoop programs for current students and iii value partnerships that promote our programs to diverse audiences our academic product suite is also widely used in research and teaching settings which allows students to become familiar with ansys simulation software and creates opportunities to strengthen our university ties and recruit fresh talent 

we support the development of our employees by providing professional development and tuition assistance conducting annual individual assessments and encouraging feedback on performance we also drive a variety of focused initiatives specifically designed to support employee development these include our annual talent reviews and succession planning emotional intelligence trainings and companysponsored education programs such as management essentials to develop frontline leaders in foundational people management skills 

developing our employees helps keep employees engaged and excited about their future at ansys it also helps mitigate risks associated with employee loss and keeping up with rapid technological and social change for the year ended december 31 2020 our annual turnover rate was 6 and of this 4 was voluntary 

compensation and benefits program 

our compensation programs provide an opportunity for employees to earn higher compensation by aligning their performance which may include contributions to our environmental social and governance objectives with the overall financial and operational success of ansys the program includes three key elements i competitive annual salaries ii annual cash incentives and sales commission programs with a majority of our employees eligible to earn more or less than the target opportunities based on both ansys’ and the employee’s performance and iii longterm equity incentives with over half of

employees receiving equity grants each year in the form of timebased restricted stock units and in the case of senior leadership timebased restricted stock units and performance stock units that vest if at all based on our financial performance and shareholder returns these grants align the longterm financial interests of our employees with those of our stockholders 

health and welfare benefit programs include marketcompetitive benefits comprised of a mix of companyprovided and other benefits including those for medical dental and vision insurance life and disability insurance defined contribution retirement plans and many different employee assistance programs such as financial legal emotional and social wellbeing employee assistance programs our investments in health and welfare benefits focus on providing choice and value to our employees so they can select marketcompetitive benefits that support their personal needs 

local regulations are considered when developing our compensation and benefits packages for employees across the globe 

safety and health 

the health and safety of our employees and their families our partners and our broad ansys community around the world continues to be a high priority at the onset of the covid19 pandemic we took action to enable our employees to work from home we closed our offices including our corporate headquarters transitioned to a remote work environment and implemented certain travel restrictions each of which has changed how we operate our business while a number of our offices have since reopened most of our locations have limited access or have few employees working on site we are continuing to monitor and manage the situation but as of now remote access remains the primary means of work for the vast majority of our workforce 

we utilize a number of technology platforms to facilitate remote working most of these tools were implemented prior to the covid19 pandemic and have proven to be instrumental in enabling us to work effectively in this environment we have also provided our employees with support including stipends and in some cases needed hardware and equipment in addition we have implemented many protocols in our offices to keep our employees safe 

employee satisfaction and engagement 

employee feedback and engagement is critical to our success we conduct global employee engagement surveys with the goal of using the feedback to improve the work environment and employee satisfaction in 2020 this feedback was critical to understand as nearly all our employees were required to work remotely due to the covid19 pandemic 

survey results showed that our executive team provided outstanding management and leadership during the pandemic 96 of employees indicated that they were satisfied with our response to the covid19 pandemic and 93 reported feeling supported by their immediate manager and their efforts to adapt to the rapidly changing environment related to the covid19 pandemic 

employee feedback is important in the areas of future vision recognition communication leadership growth and development managers communicate results of the survey to their teams and involve employees in the action planning process the findings from these surveys help us to continually improve performance and engagement our 2020 global engagement survey demonstrated that our employees are highly engaged our engagement score results indicated that we improved against past performance and also exceeded external benchmarks

 item 1a risk factors 

the following are important factors we have identified that could affect our future results and an investment in our securities in addition from time to time we provide information including information contained in this annual report on form 10k that contains forwardlooking statements concerning among other things projected financial performance total addressable market market and industry sector growth product development and commercialization or other aspects of future operations such statements are based on the assumptions and expectations of our management at the time such statements are made we caution investors that our performance and any forwardlooking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties including but not limited to the following 

covid19 pandemic risks 

the covid19 pandemic has had and is expected to continue to have an effect on our business employees and consolidated financial statements the uncertainty surrounding the remaining duration and impact of the covid19 pandemic limits our ability to accurately forecast expected business results in the near term 

the health and safety of our employees and their families our partners and our other constituents around the world is a high priority at the onset of the covid19 pandemic we took action to enable our employees to work from home we closed our offices including our corporate headquarters transitioned to a remote work environment and implemented certain travel restrictions each of which has changed how we operate our business while a number of our offices have since reopened most of our locations have limited access and few employees working on site we continue to monitor and manage the situation but as of now remote access remains the primary means of work for most of our workforce 

the covid19 outbreak and preventative measures taken to contain the covid19 outbreak continue to cause business slowdowns and shutdowns in affected areas a majority of our customer events and those of our channel partners are virtual only experiences these events may not be as successful as customer events prior to covid19 because among other reasons the limited number of such events the varying attendance levels and virtual event fatigue 

an extended period of remote work arrangements negatively impacts the sales pipeline due to reduced delayed or altered sales and marketing interactions with customers and potential customers expose us to increased risk of cyber incidents delay or alter product roadmaps or research and development due to reduced or limited access to technologies equipment or services and delay or disrupt recruitment efforts limitations on availability ease of use or increased cost related to the use of our products in our customers’ remote work environments could also result in a decline in demand for our products 

we have experienced and continue to expect that our larger customer accounts will perform more strongly than the small and mediumsized businesses during the pandemic in addition the shifting preference from perpetual licenses to timebased licenses was and is expected to continue to be elevated as a result of the impacts of covid19 there may also be continued lower activity levels in the end markets we service or declining financial performance of our customers and channel partners which could result in lower rates of renewal which have historically been stable and high and cancellations reductions or delays for our products and services due to our subscriptionbased business model the effect of the pandemic may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods and could impact future growth rates 

the situation surrounding covid19 remains fluid and given its inherent uncertainty we expect the pandemic will continue to have an impact on our business and consolidated financial statements in the near term the duration and extent of the impact from the covid19 pandemic depends on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time such as the timing and effectiveness of vaccination efforts in the markets where we do business transmission rates of the virus and the development of virus mutations and variants the nature and scope of government economic recovery measures and the extent and effectiveness of containment actions the impact of the covid19 pandemic may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks and uncertainties described in this “risk factors” section

global operational risks 

we are subject to trade restrictions that could impact our ability to sell to customers and result in liability for violations 

due to the global nature of our business we are subject to trade protection laws policies sanctions and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment for example we are subject to import and export restrictions and regulations that prohibit the shipment or provision of certain products and services to certain countries regions and persons targeted by the us including the export administration regulations administered by the us bureau of industry and security bis and economic and trade sanctions administered by the us treasury department’s office of foreign assets control ofac during the second quarter of 2019 the bis placed certain entities on its entity list certain of our existing and prospective customers including huawei were included in this list at the end of the second quarter of 2020 bis heightened restrictions relating to certain military end uses impacting the use of our semiconductor and electronics software in china russia and venezuela 

the entity list and ofac restrictions limit our ability to deliver products and services to these customers and in the absence of a license our ability to sell products and services to these customers in the future in addition restrictions implemented by ofac restrict our ability to sell to or transact with restricted individuals entities or countries the inclusion of companies on the entity list and subjecting companies to the heightened restrictions may encourage them to seek substitute products from competitors whose products are not subject to these restrictions or to develop their own products we cannot predict whether or when any changes will be made that eliminate or decrease these limitations on our ability to sell products and provide services to these customers additionally other existing and prospective customers may be added to the entity list andor be subjected to trade restrictions in the future and such actions may result in other indirect impacts that cannot be quantified including the imposition of additional trade restrictions on our business by the us china or other countries restrictions on our ability to sell and ship to customers could have a significant adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial statements 

our products could be shipped to restricted parties by third parties including our channel partners even though we take measures to ensure that our channel partners comply with all applicable trade restrictions any failure by channel partners to comply with such restrictions could have negative consequences for us violators of trade restrictions may be subject to significant penalties which may include considerable monetary fines criminal proceedings against them and their officers and employees a denial of export privileges and suspension or debarment from selling products or services to the federal government any such penalties could have a significant adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial statements in addition the political and media scrutiny surrounding any governmental investigation could cause significant expense and reputational harm and distract senior executives from managing normal daytoday operations 

failure to comply with laws and regulations could harm our business 

we develop and sell software and consulting services and maintain support operations in more than 40 countries whose laws and practices differ from one another and are subject to unexpected changes furthermore our business is subject to regulation by various global governmental agencies including agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing employment and labor laws workplace safety environmental laws consumer protection laws antibribery laws importexport controls securities laws and tax laws and regulations in certain jurisdictions these regulatory requirements may be more stringent than those in the united states managing these geographically diverse operations requires significant attention and resources to ensure compliance 

our global reach includes countries considered highrisk environments for public corruption this exposes us to risks associated with violations of anticorruption laws and regulations such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act to promote compliance we forbid our agents and employees from engaging in corrupt behavior and have implemented a compliance program to prevent and detect violations of anticorruption laws there remains however a risk that illegal conduct could occur thereby exposing us to the financial and reputational risks associated with a violation of anticorruption laws 

noncompliance with applicable regulations or requirements could subject us to investigations sanctions enforcement actions disgorgement of profits fines damages civil and criminal penalties or injunctions and may result in our inability to provide certain products and services to existing or prospective customers if any governmental sanctions are imposed or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation or if customers make claims against us for compensation our business and consolidated financial statements could be harmed in addition responding to any action will likely result in a significant diversion of management’s attention and resources and an increase in professional fees and costs enforcement actions and sanctions could have a significant adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial statements

our business practices with respect to the collection use and management of personal information could give rise to operational interruption liabilities or reputational harm as a result of governmental regulation legal requirements or industry standards relating to consumer privacy and data protection 

we are subject to the laws and regulations of numerous jurisdictions worldwide regarding accessing processing sharing using storing transmitting disclosing and protecting personal data as regulatory focus on privacy data and security issues continues to increase and evolve and as worldwide laws and regulations concerning the handling of personal data expand and become more complex data protection standards continue to become more strict and potential risks related to data processing within our business may intensify 

the general data protection regulation gdpr which went into effect in may 2018 and governs data privacy practices within the european economic area eea applies to our data processing activities within the eea as well as the processing of eea citizen data globally and imposes various compliance obligations related to the handling of personal data in the delivery of our products and services and to business operations involving employee data compliance with the gdpr has and will continue to require deployment of substantial resources and increased costs if we fail to comply with the gdpr it may lead to regulatory enforcement actions which can result in monetary penalties of up to 4 of annual worldwide revenue private lawsuits extensive and prescriptive consent decrees or judgments that may require additional resources or expenses for compliance and may cause reputational damage as a result of the expiration of the brexit transition period on december 24 2020 the uk and the european union reached a provisional agreement temporarily permitting the continued flow of personal data between the regions anticipated further evolution of european union regulations on this topic including the impact of brexit on these regulations in the uk and any related changes to the regulatory framework in the uk may increase substantially the penalties to which we could be subject in the event of any noncompliance we may incur substantial expense in complying with the new obligations to be imposed by new regulations and we may be required to make significant changes to our software applications and expanding business operations all of which may adversely affect our results of operations 

the gdpr restricts transfers of personal data outside of the eea to third countries deemed to lack adequate privacy protections including the us unless an appropriate safeguard specified by the gdpr is implemented such as the standard contractual clauses “sccs” approved by the european commission binding corporate rules and until july 16 2020 the privacy shield for euus data transfers in july 2020 the court of justice of the eu invalidated privacy shield and also opined on compliance obligations for companies relying upon sccs as their valid basis of transferring personal data outside of the eu this decision led to uncertainty about the legal basis for personal data transfers out of the eu to the us potential new rules and restrictions on the transfer of data across borders could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our products and services in some markets this decision could also give rise to operational interruption in the performance of services for customers and internal processing of employee information regulatory liabilities or reputational harm 

in addition california implemented the california consumer privacy act ccpa as of january 2020 which requires compliance measures similar to those of the gdpr and establishes the first state standard for a comprehensive set of data privacy rights the ccpa among other things gives california residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used in november 2020 california voters passed the california privacy rights act cpra the cpra which is expected to take effect on january 1 2023 significantly expands the ccpa including by introducing additional obligations such as data minimization and storage limitations granting additional rights to consumers such as correction of personal information and additional optout rights and creates a new agency to implement and enforce the law several other states have proposed data privacy laws that would impose obligations on us with respect to how we collect and use personal data including customer data to comply with us state laws and any data breach notification laws that vary across states we may be required to invest in additional resources or tools to manage our data processing activities if we fail to comply with the requirements of us data privacy and data breach notification laws we may be subject to state monetary fines consent decrees issued by the federal trade commission or other regulatory enforcement agencies and possible reputational damage 

adverse economic and geopolitical conditions may impact our operations and financial performance 

our operations and performance depend significantly on global macroeconomic specific foreign country and us domestic economic conditions adverse conditions in the macroeconomic environment may result in a decreased demand for our products and services constrained credit and liquidity reduced government spending and volatility in equity and foreign exchange markets in addition significant downturns and volatility in the global economy expose us to impairments of certain assets if their values deteriorate tighter credit due to economic conditions may diminish our future borrowing ability and increase borrowing costs under our existing credit facilities customers ability to pay for our products and services may also be impaired which could lead to an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts and writeoffs of accounts receivable

a majority of our business comes from outside the us and our customers supply a wide array of goods and services to most of the world’s major economic regions international revenue represented 538 579 and 609 of our total revenue for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively in fiscal year 2020 our largest geographic revenue bases were the us japan and germany 

when the significant economies in which we do business deteriorate or suffer a period of uncertainty our business and financial performance may be impacted through reduced customer and government spending changes in purchasing cycles or timing and reduced access to credit for our customers among other events furthermore customer spending levels in any foreign jurisdiction may be adversely impacted by changes in domestic policies including tax and trade policies 

a substantial portion of our license and maintenance revenue is derived from annual lease and maintenance contracts which typically have a high rate of customer renewal when the rate of renewal for these contracts is adversely affected by economic or other factors our lease license and maintenance growth is adversely affected 

foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect our consolidated financial statements 

as a result of our significant international presence we have revenue expenses cash accounts receivable and payment obligations denominated in foreign currencies most notably the euro and japanese yen our operating results are adversely affected when the us dollar strengthens relative to foreign currencies and are positively affected when the us dollar weakens relative to foreign currencies when the us dollar strengthens relative to other currencies certain channel partners who pay us in us dollars may have trouble paying on time or may have trouble distributing our products due to the impact of the currency exchange fluctuation on their cash flows this may impact our ability to distribute our products into certain regions and markets 

we seek to reduce our currency exchange transaction risks primarily through our normal operating and treasury activities including derivative instruments but there can be no assurance that these activities will be successful in reducing these risks in addition we incur transaction fees in the usage of such derivative instruments changes in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our consolidated financial statements 

a catastrophic event or infrastructure failure could result in the loss of business and adverse financial consequences 

a significant portion of our personnel source code and computer equipment is located in each of california pennsylvania british columbia india japan and throughout europe a natural disaster cyberattack terrorist act pandemic or other unforeseen catastrophe in any of these areas or a breakdown in our business infrastructure such as an interruption in power supply telephone system or information technology systems could cause disruptions to our sales operations services and product development activities as our sales are generally greater at the end of a quarter the potential adverse effects resulting from any of these events would be accentuated if they occurred at quarter end 

effective business continuity disaster recovery and crisis management plans are critical to minimizing the impact of such unplanned or unexpected events we also face increasing customer certification requirements with respect to such systems failure to establish plans that effectively mitigate the impacts of these disruptions or meet customer certification requirements could have a significant adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial statements 

see “the covid19 pandemic” portion of this “risk factors” section for a description of the impact of the pandemic on us 

industry operational risks 

our industry is highly competitive which could result in downward pressure on our prices 

we continue to experience competition across all markets for our products and services some of our current and potential competitors have greater financial technical marketing and other resources than we do and some have wellestablished relationships with our current and potential customers our current and potential competitors also include firms that have competed or may in the future compete by means of open source licensing companies we have or could have strategic alliances with could reduce or discontinue technical software development and marketing relationships with us for competitive purposes 

if our competitors offer deep discounts on certain products or services or develop products that the marketplace considers more valuable we may lower prices or offer discounts or other favorable terms to compete successfully our maintenance products which include software license updates and product support fees are generally priced as a percentage of new software license fees our competitors may offer lower percentage pricing on product updates and support some competitors may bundle software products for promotional purposes or as a longterm pricing strategy or provide guarantees of prices product 

table of content s 

implementations or wider geographical license usage provisions any of these practices could over time significantly constrain the prices that we can charge for certain products 

furthermore if we do not adapt pricing models to reflect changes in customer usage of our products or changes in customer demand our software license revenues could decrease additionally increased distribution of applications through application service providers including softwareasaservice providers may reduce the average price of our products or adversely affect other sales of our products reducing new software license revenues unless we can offset price reductions with volume increases 

these competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes price reductions andor increased operating costs and could result in lower revenues margins and net income 

we may not be successful in developing and marketing new products to adequately address the rapidly changing technology industry 

we operate in an industry generally characterized by rapidly changing technology and frequent new product introductions which can render existing products obsolete or unmarketable a major factor in our future success will be our ability to anticipate technological changes and to develop and introduce in a timely manner new products to meet those changes our ability to grow revenue will be dependent on our ability to respond to customer needs in the areas of among others 5g autonomous vehicles iiot and electrification and to leverage cloud computing and new computing platforms in addition our future success may depend on our ability to continue to develop a systems integrator ecosystem able to handle integrations and process and application development to address the challenge of the increasingly complex integration of our products’ different functionalities to address customers’ requirements in addition for those customers who authorize a thirdparty technology partner to access their data we do not provide any warranty related to the functionality security and integrity of the data transmission or processing despite contract provisions to protect us customers may look to us to support and provide warranties for the thirdparty applications integrations data and content even though not developed or sold by us which may expose us to potential claims liabilities and obligations all of which could harm our business 

we devote substantial resources to research and development which could cause our operating results to decline 

we devote substantial resources to research and development new competitors technological advances in the software development industry by us or our competitors acquisitions entry into new markets or other competitive factors may require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated if we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated without a corresponding increase in revenue operating results could decline in addition our periodic research and development expenses may be independent of our level of revenue which could negatively impact financial results 

there can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing and marketing on a timely basis new products or product enhancements or that the new products will adequately address the changing needs of the marketplace or that we will successfully manage the transition from existing products software products as complex as those we offer may contain undetected errors defects or vulnerabilities when first introduced or as new versions are released and the likelihood of errors defects or vulnerabilities is increased as a result of our commitment to the frequency of product releases there can be no assurance that errors defects or vulnerabilities will not be found in any new or enhanced products after the commencement of commercial shipments the occurrence of any defects or errors in our products could result in lost or delayed market acceptance and sales of our products delays in payment to us by customers loss of customers or market share product returns damage to our reputation diversion of our resources increased service and warranty expenses or financial concessions increased insurance costs and liability for damages 

the price of our common stock is subject to volatility 

the market price of securities of software companies is subject to significant fluctuations for example our common stock price ranged from 20007 to 36982 per share during 2020 the valuation and trading price of our common stock may not be predictable factors that may adversely impact our share price include our failure to meet analyst expectations reduced expectations regarding financial outlook increases in our debt levels changes in management or our material announcements or those of our competitors in addition volatility could result from causes that are unrelated to our operating performance such as conditions in the financial markets or the software industry generally

company operational risks 

we are dependent upon our channel partners for a significant percentage of our revenue and usage of channel partners presents certain heightened compliance risks 

we distribute our products through a global network of independent channel partners which accounted for 222 229 and 224 of our revenue during the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively channel partners sell our software products to new and existing customers expand installations within the existing customer base offer consulting services and provide the first line of technical support in the apac and emea regions we are highly dependent upon our channel partners difficulties in ongoing relationships with channel partners such as failure to meet performance criteria and differences in handling customer relationships could adversely affect our performance additionally the loss of any major channel partner including a channel partners decision to sell competing products rather than ours could result in reduced revenue moreover our future success will depend substantially on the ability and willingness of our channel partners to dedicate the resources necessary to understand and promote our expanding portfolio of products and to support a larger installed base within each of our geographic regions if the channel partners are unable or unwilling to do so we may be unable to sustain revenue growth 

we have been increasing the number of our channel partners particularly in international locations the business relationships with many of our channel partners are recently established and could result in additional compliance burdens for us in addition these new channel partners have a lessestablished payment history and revenue from these channel partners could come with a higher rate of bad debt expense where channel partners operate on our behalf to collect and process personal data of customer contacts failure to comply with relevant data privacy laws in the handling of such personal data could result in liability to us for any fines civil suits or nonfinancial performance obligations imposed by regulatory authorities on these partners with respect to our customer data 

certain products require a higher level of sales and support expertise failure of our sales channel particularly the independent channel partners to obtain this expertise and to sell the new product offerings effectively could have an adverse impact on our sales in future periods any of these problems may result in the loss of or delay in customer acceptance diversion of development resources damage to our reputation or increased service and warranty costs any of which could have a significant adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial statements 

we may not be able to realize the potential benefit of our acquisitions and such acquisitions could pose risks to our business 

we consummate acquisitions to support our longterm strategic direction our 2020 acquisitions included lumerical and agi and our 2019 acquisitions included granta design helic dfr solutions lst and dynardo 

each acquisition that we complete may present risks including difficulty in integrating the management teams strategies cultures and operations of the companies or businesses failing to achieve anticipated synergies revenue increases or cost savings difficulty incorporating and integrating the acquired technologies or products with our existing product lines difficulty with sales distribution and marketing functions failure to develop new products and services that utilize the technologies and resources of the companies disruption of our ongoing business and diversion of managements attention to transition or integration issues liabilities that were not identified during the acquisition process the loss of our key employees customers partners and channel partners or those of the acquired companies or businesses and cybersecurity and data privacy risks 

where customer contacts and leads are a significant consideration in the purchase price or expected financial outcome of an acquisition failure to identify or mitigate data privacy concerns with the collection use and retention of personal data may adversely impact our ability to use this information as anticipated and regulatory obligations may require that we delete all or a portion of the database or take additional remediation measures before use this may impact the value of the acquisition or reduce forecasted sales 

future acquisitions may involve the expenditure of significant cash resources the incurrence of debt which increases our interest expense and leverage or the issuance of equity which is dilutive to stockholders and may decrease earnings per share 

we allocate a portion of the purchase price to goodwill and intangible assets if we do not realize all the economic benefits of an acquisition there could be an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets furthermore impairment charges are generally not taxdeductible and will result in an increased effective income tax rate in the period the impairment is recorded 

if we do not achieve the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by our management or the financial and industry analysts there could be a significant adverse effect on our stock price business and consolidated financial statements

the ongoing implementation of a new functionality to the existing customer relationship management crm system may not achieve the corporate benefits identified 

we are in the process of implementing new functionality in our existing crm system while this system is anticipated to automate and deliver operational efficiencies across the demand generation sales cycle order processing and customer service phases of the customer journey to date this project has not achieved the anticipated benefits and there is a risk that the benefits could be further substantially delayed there is also a risk that we will have to write off previously capitalized expenditures if the project is not successful or if implementation decisions regarding the project are modified factors that could further delay the timing of benefits realization include 

• changes in leadership and project objectives 

• additional needs for technical expertise and manpower and 

• longer than anticipated time horizon for employee adoption and mastery 

any of the above could divert efforts of key operational management away from other aspects of the business including the maintenance of the current crm platform and result in increased consulting and software costs these factors could have a significant negative impact on our business and consolidated financial statements 

if we are unable to attract and retain key talent our business could be adversely affected 

our success depends upon the continued service of our senior executives and our key technical and sales employees most of these individuals could terminate their relationship with us at any time the loss of any of them for which there has not been adequate knowledgesharing and transfer might significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives and could materially harm our business and customer relationships 

in addition because of the highly technical nature of our products and services we must attract and retain highly skilled engineering and development personnel the market for this talent is highly competitive we have difficulty filling these roles and our talent has been the subject of recruitment by our competitors while we have noncompetition and nonsolicitation agreements with many of these individuals the enforceability of these agreements may be limited by courts 

while we have historically recruited globally for positions in the us in recent years our ability to do so has been curbed by more restrictive domestic immigration laws if the immigration laws become even stricter or the processing of immigration requests becomes even more cumbersome or less efficient or if we have less success in recruiting and retaining key personnel our business reputation and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 

we may be subject to proceedings that could harm our business 

we are subject to various investigations claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business including commercial disputes labor and employment matters tax audits and litigations alleged infringement of intellectual property rights and other matters use or distribution of our products could generate product liability regulatory infraction or similar claims by our customers end users channel partners government entities or other third parties sales and marketing activities that impact processing of personal data as well as measures taken to ensure license compliance may also result in claims by customers and individual employees of customers each of these matters is subject to various uncertainties and it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could have a significant adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements as well as cause reputational damage 

we may suffer reputational or financial harm if we have product standard or quality issues 

we have separate quality systems and registrations under the iso 90012015 standard in addition to other governmental and industrial regulations our continued compliance with quality standards and favorable outcomes in periodic examinations is important to retain current customers and vital to procure new sales if it was determined that we were not in compliance with various regulatory or iso 9001 standards our certificates of registration could be suspended requiring remedial action and a timeconsuming reregistration process product quality issues or failures could result in our reputation becoming diminished resulting in a material adverse impact on our business and consolidated financial statements 

our shortterm and longterm sales forecast may not be accurate which could result in an adverse impact on our business and consolidated financial statements 

the software business is generally characterized by long sales cycles these long sales cycles increase the difficulty of predicting sales for any particular quarter many operational and strategic decisions are based upon short and longterm sales 

table of content s 

forecasts our sales personnel continually monitor the status of proposals including the estimated closing date and the value of the sale in order to forecast quarterly sales these forecasts are subject to significant estimation and are impacted by many external factors including global economic conditions and the performance of our customers the heightened uncertainty resulting from the covid19 pandemic results in greater ranges and variability of these forecasts 

a variation in actual sales activity from that forecasted could cause us to plan or budget incorrectly and therefore could have a significant adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial statements management also forecasts macroeconomic trends and developments and integrates them through longrange planning into budgets research and development strategies and a wide variety of general management duties global economic conditions and the effect those conditions and any disruptions in global markets have on our customers may have a significant impact on the accuracy of our sales forecasts these conditions may increase the likelihood or the magnitude of variations between actual sales activity and our sales forecasts and as a result our performance may be hindered because of a failure to properly match corporate strategy with economic conditions this in turn could have a significant adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial statements to the extent our forecasts are incorrect and as a result we fail to meet analyst expectations regarding financial performance or miss or reduce the financial guidance we give to investors our share price may be adversely impacted 

intellectual property risks 

our success is highly dependent upon the legal protection of our proprietary technology 

we primarily rely upon contracts copyright patent trademark and trade secrets laws to protect our technology we maintain intellectual property programs including applying for patents registering trademarks and copyrights protecting trade secrets entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees and channel partners and limiting access to and distribution of our software documentation and other proprietary information however software programs are particularly prone to piracy which is a global phenomenon and as a result we may lose revenue from piracy or usage and distribution of unlicensed software additionally patent copyright trademark and trade secret protection do not provide the same coverage in every country in which we sell our products and services policing the unauthorized distribution and use of our products is difficult and software piracy including online piracy is a persistent problem while we continue to develop better mechanisms to detect and report or investigate unauthorized use of our software we are also constrained by data privacy laws that restrict our ability to collect data about unlawful usage in some countries we cannot assure that the steps we take to protect our proprietary technology are adequate to prevent misappropriation of our software by third parties or that third parties will not copy our technology or develop similar technology independently to compete with our products despite our efforts to prevent such activities we may nonetheless lose significant revenue due to illegal use of our software or technology 

costly and timeconsuming litigation would be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of trade secret rights and related confidentiality and nondisclosure provisions across our contractual agreements and partnerships in addition third parties may subject us to infringement claims with respect to their intellectual property rights any such litigation could be costly to defend damage our reputation and distract our employees from their daily work any successful infringement claims asserted against us could require us to develop technology workarounds for the impacted technologies products or solutions which could be costly disrupt product development and delay gotomarket activities such disruption and delay could negatively impact our financial results 

we may not be able to continue to obtain licenses to thirdparty software and intellectual property on reasonable terms or at all which may disrupt our business and harm our financial results 

we license thirdparty software and other intellectual property for use in product research and development and in several instances for inclusion in our products we also license thirdparty software including the software of our competitors to test the interoperability of our products with other industry products and in connection with our solutions and professional services these licenses may need to be renegotiated or renewed from time to time or we may need to obtain new licenses in the future third parties may stop adequately supporting or maintaining their technology or they or their technology may be acquired by our competitors who elect to terminate our contractual relationship if we are unable to obtain licenses to such thirdparty software and intellectual property on reasonable terms or at all we may not be able to sell the affected products our customers’ usage of the products may be interrupted or our product development processes and professional services offerings may be disrupted which could in turn harm our financial results our customers ability to utilize our software and our reputation

cybersecurity risks 

cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue increased costs liability claims or harm to our reputation 

while we undertake commercially reasonable efforts to maintain and improve the security and integrity of our products source code computer systems and data with respect to the relative sensitivity of such software systems and data the number of computer “hackers” developing and deploying destructive software programs that attack our products and computer systems continues to increase we have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs to enhance our cybersecurity efforts because the tactics and tools used to obtain unauthorized access to networks or to sabotage systems are constantly evolving we may be unable to implement adequate preventive measures such an attack could disrupt the proper functioning of our products cause errors in the output of our customers work or allow unauthorized access to and disclosure of our sensitive proprietary or confidential information or that of our customers and employees in the event of a serious breach of our products or systems or where a breach occurs due to our failure to implement reasonable and appropriate safeguards our reputation may suffer customers may stop buying products or may terminate current services we could face lawsuits and potential civil liability as well as regulatory fines and nonfinancial penalties for any personal data breach and our financial performance could be negatively impacted 

there is also a danger of industrial espionage cyberattacks misuse theft of information or assets including source code or damage to assets by people who have gained unauthorized access to our facilities systems or information this includes access to systems or information through email phishing attacks on our employees which has become a very prevalent technique used against companies often delaying detection through increasingly complex practices the objective of these attacks is often to acquire user account credentials in order to access other computer systems through linked accounts or where users have recycled passwords across systems additionally the recent attack against solarwinds in which hackers inserted malware into a solarwinds software update highlights the growing risk from the infection of software while it is under assembly known as a supply chain attack as a software provider we could become a vector for a similar style attack or could become the subject of one through a supply chain compromise 

inadequate security practices or inadvertent acts or omissions by our employees and partners may also result in unauthorized access to our data employees or third parties may also intentionally compromise our or our customers’ security or systems such cybersecurity breaches misuse of data or other disruptions could lead to loss of or unauthorized disclosure of our source code or other confidential information unlicensed use and distribution of our products without compensation illegal use of our products that could jeopardize the security of customer information stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and theft manipulation and destruction of proprietary data resulting in defective products performance downtimes and possible violation of export laws and other regulatory compliance requirements although we actively employ measures to combat such activities preventing unauthorized access to our systems and data is inherently difficult in addition litigation to either pursue our legal rights or defend any claims against us could be costly and timeconsuming and may divert managements attention and adversely affect the markets perception of us and our products 

we have experienced targeted and nontargeted cybersecurity attacks and incidents in the past that have resulted in unauthorized persons gaining access to our information and systems and we could in the future experience similar attacks to date no cybersecurity incident or attack has had a material impact on our business or consolidated financial statements 

a number of our core processes such as software development sales and marketing customer service and financial transactions rely on it infrastructure and applications we also rely on thirdparty service providers and products which are exposed to various security vulnerabilities outside of our control malicious software sabotage and other cybersecurity breaches of the types discussed above could cause an outage of our infrastructure which could cause shortterm disruption in operations or in the event of a longer disruption lead to a substantial denial of service to our customers and ultimately to production downtime recovery costs and customer claims for breach of contract as well as reputational damage and impact to employee morale and productivity 

we rely on service providers for infrastructure and cloudbased products 

we use a number of thirdparty service providers which we do not control for key components of our infrastructure particularly with respect to development and delivery of our cloudbased products the utilization of these service providers gives us greater flexibility in efficiently delivering a more tailored scalable customer experience but also exposes us to additional risks and vulnerabilities thirdparty service providers operate their own platforms that we access and we are therefore vulnerable to their service interruptions we may experience interruptions delays and outages in service and availability from time to time as a result of problems with our thirdparty service providers’ infrastructure lack of availability of this infrastructure could be due to a number of potential causes including technical failures natural disasters fraud or security attacks that we cannot predict or prevent such outages could lead to the triggering of our service level agreements and 

table of content s 

the issuance of credits to our cloudbased product customers which may impact our business and consolidated financial statements in addition those of our products and services that depend upon hosted components are vulnerable to security risks inherent in webbased technologies including greater risk of unauthorized access to or use of customers’ protected data interception of data transmission misappropriation or modification of data corruption of data and attacks by bad actors against our service providers may also adversely affect our products or product and service delivery malicious code viruses or vulnerabilities that are undetected by our service providers may disrupt our business operations generally and may have a disproportionate effect on those of our products that are developed and delivered in the cloud environment if our security or that of any of our thirdparty service providers is compromised our software is unavailable or our customers are unable to use our software within a reasonable amount of time or at all then our business and financial statements could be adversely affected 

these risks though largely outside our control may impact customer perception of our products service and support and may damage our brand while we devote resources to maintaining the security and integrity of our products and systems as well as ensuring adequate due diligence for our thirdparty service providers cloud security and reliability is inherently challenging in the event of a material breach of data hosted by our service providers or a serious security incident on behalf of caused by or experienced by a service provider we may experience significant operational and technical difficulties loss of data including customer data diminished competitive position or reputation and loss of customer engagement which could result in civil liabilities and a negative impact to financial performance it is also possible that our customers and potential customers would hold us accountable for any breach of security affecting a thirdparty service provider’s infrastructure and we may incur significant liability from those customers and from third parties with respect to any breach affecting these systems we may not be able to recover a material portion of our liabilities to our customers and third parties from a thirdparty cloud provider 

financial risks 

our indebtedness could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in connection with our acquisitions of agi and lst we have outstanding borrowings of 3750 million and 4250 million respectively under term loan facilities which mature on november 1 2024 we also have access to a 5000 million revolving credit facility which includes a 500 million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit the credit agreements governing these loans contain customary representations and warranties affirmative and negative covenants and events of default the credit agreements also contain a financial covenant requiring us to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of indebtedness to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization not exceeding 350 to 100 as of the end of any fiscal quarter for the fourquarter period ending on such date with an opportunity for a temporary increase in such consolidated leverage ratio to 400 to 100 upon the consummation of certain qualified acquisitions for which the aggregate consideration is at least 2500 million 

notwithstanding the limits contained in the credit agreements governing our term loan facilities and credit facility we may be able to incur substantial additional debt from time to time to finance working capital capital expenditures share repurchases investments or acquisitions or for other purposes if we do so the risks related to our level of debt could intensify specifically our level of debt could 

• make it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations and other ongoing business obligations which may result in defaults 

• result in an event of default if we fail to comply with the financial and other covenants contained in the agreement governing our debt which could result in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable or require us to negotiate an amendment to financial or other covenants that could cause us to incur additional fees and expenses 

• limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or other general corporate requirements 

• reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and other general corporate purposes 

• increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions 

• expose us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings including borrowings under the credit facility are at variable rates of interest 

• limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to and increasing our vulnerability to changes in our business the industries in which we operate and the overall economy 

table of content s 

• place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to other less leveraged competitors 

• increase our cost of borrowing and 

• increase our effective tax rate as interest expense could become nondeductible 

any of the abovelisted factors could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt agreements 

furthermore borrowings under the credit agreement use the london interbank offering rate libor as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate libor has been the subject of recent national international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform and the financial industry is currently transitioning away from libor as a benchmark for the interbank lending market the consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted but could include an increase in the cost of our variable rate indebtedness 

changes to tax laws variable tax estimates and tax authority audits could impact our financial results and operations 

our operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the us and in multiple foreign jurisdictions a change in the tax law in the jurisdictions in which we do business including an increase in tax rates an adverse change in the treatment of an item of income or expense or a decrease in tax rates in a jurisdiction in which we have significant deferred tax assets could result in a material increase in tax expense furthermore we have recorded significant deferred tax liabilities related to acquired intangible assets that are not deductible for tax purposes these deferred tax liabilities are based on future statutory tax rates in the locations in which the intangible assets are recorded any future changes in statutory tax rates would be recorded as an adjustment to the deferred tax liabilities in the period the change is announced and could have a material impact on our effective tax rate during that period 

we also make significant estimates in determining our worldwide income tax provision these estimates involve complex tax regulations in many jurisdictions and are subject to many transactions and calculations in which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain the outcome of tax matters could be different than the estimates reflected in the historical income tax provision and related accruals such differences could have a material impact on income tax expense and net income in the periods in which such determinations are made 

the amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities these audits can result in additional assessments including interest and penalties our estimates for liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions is highly judgmental and actual future outcomes may result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities including estimates for uncertain tax positions in the period the assessments are made or resolved audits are closed or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire as a result our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly or annual basis

management considers the competition and price pressure that it faces in the short and longterm by focusing on expanding the breadth depth ease of use and quality of the technologies features functionality and integrated multiphysics capabilities of our software products as compared to our competitors investing in research and development to develop new and innovative products and increase the capabilities of our existing products supplying new products and services focusing on customer needs training consulting and support and enhancing our distribution channels we also consider acquisitions to supplement our global engineering talent product offerings and distribution channels 

overview 

impact of covid19

overall gaap and nongaap results 

this section includes a discussion of gaap and nongaap results for reconciliations of nongaap results to gaap results see the section titled nongaap results herein 

our gaap and nongaap results for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 reflected the following variances 



we experienced an increase in revenue during the year ended december 31 2020 due to growth in lease licenses maintenance and service revenue and contributions from our recent acquisitions partially offset by reductions in perpetual license revenue the covid19 pandemic and trade restrictions with china adversely impacted our revenue during the year ended december 31 2020 with the most pronounced reductions occurring in perpetual licenses however due to our diverse customer base both from a vertical and geographic perspective as well as the close relationships with customers we were able to conduct a large amount of business remotely which partially mitigated the impacts of the covid19 outbreak 

we also experienced increased operating expenses primarily due to increased personnel costs higher stockbased compensation and additional operating expenses related to acquisitions while our hiring pace was slowed and certain discretionary operational expenses such as travel were reduced the covid19 pandemic did not have a material impact on our operating expenses during the year ended december 31 2020 

the nongaap results exclude the income statement effects of the acquisition accounting adjustments to deferred revenue stockbased compensation amortization of acquired intangible assets transaction expenses related to business combinations and adjustments related to the transition tax associated with the tax cuts and jobs act 

impact of foreign currency 

our comparative financial results were impacted by fluctuations in the us dollar during the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 the net favorable impacts on our gaap and nongaap revenue and operating income as a result of the weakened us dollar when measured against our primary foreign currencies are reflected in the table below 



table of content s 

in constant currency our variances were as follows 



constant currency amounts exclude the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on the reported results to present this information the 2020 results for entities whose functional currency is a currency other than the us dollar were converted to us dollars at rates that were in effect for the 2019 comparable period rather than the actual exchange rates in effect for 2020 constant currency growth rates are calculated by adjusting the 2020 reported revenue and operating income amounts by the 2020 currency fluctuation impacts and comparing to the 2019 comparable period reported revenue and operating income amounts 

other key business metric 

annual contract value acv is one of our key performance metrics and is useful to investors in assessing the strength and trajectory of our business given that revenue is variable due to the upfront revenue recognition of multiyear lease license sales we provide acv as a supplemental metric to help evaluate the annual performance of the business summed over the long term acv and revenue lead to similar outcomes however there will be years where acv growth lags revenue growth and other years where acv growth leads revenue growth it is used by management in financial and operational decisionmaking and in setting sales targets used for compensation acv should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue as acv is a performance metric and is not intended to be combined with any of these items there is no gaap measure comparable to acv acv is composed of the following 

• the annualized value of maintenance and lease contracts with start dates or anniversary dates during the period plus 

• the value of perpetual license contracts with start dates during the period plus 

• the annualized value of fixedterm services contracts with start dates or anniversary dates during the period plus 

• the value of work performed during the period on fixeddeliverable services contracts 

our acv was as follows 



recurring acv is composed of both lease licenses and maintenance contracts the increase in recurring acv reflected for the year ended december 31 2020 has been driven by a meaningful reduction in perpetual licenses and an increased preference for lease licenses due in part to the impacts of covid19 

while the resilience of our business is evident in the growth shown above the economic conditions due to the covid19 outbreak have disrupted the business of our customers and partners and have adversely impacted our business and consolidated results in addition trade discussions between the us and china led to certain entities being placed on a restricted entity list these restrictions limited our ability to deliver products and services to these customers the 2019 operating results include approximately 200 million of acv related to transactions that occurred prior to the placement of the restrictions these restrictions remained in place throughout 2020 

other financial information 

our financial position includes 9132 million in cash and shortterm investments and working capital of 9904 million as of december 31 2020 

during the year ended december 31 2020 we repurchased 07 million shares for 1610 million at an average price of 23348 per share under our stock repurchase program all of which occurred during the first quarter as of december 31 2020 we had 28 million shares remaining available for repurchase under our authorized share repurchase program

to drive growth we continue to focus on a number of sales improvement activities across the geographic regions including sales hiring pipeline building productivity initiatives and customer engagement activities 

continued trade tensions between the us and china together with the uncertainty around the covid19 outbreak may further restrict our ability to sell and distribute our products to certain customers and our ability to collect against existing trade receivables and could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition refer to additional details in risk factors under part i item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

industry commentary

revenue 



our revenue in the year ended december 31 2020 increased 109 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 while revenue grew 98 in constant currency the growth rate was favorably impacted by our continued investments in our global sales support and marketing organizations the timing and duration of our multiyear lease contracts and our 2020 and 2019 acquisitions product sales contributed incremental revenue of 849 million the growth rate was negatively impacted by the trade restrictions between the united states and china and the impact of covid19 lease license revenue increased 232 or 213 in constant currency as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 annual maintenance contracts that were sold with new perpetual licenses maintenance contracts for new perpetual licenses sold in previous years and the maintenance portion of lease license contracts collectively contributed to maintenance revenue growth of 105 or 98 in constant currency service revenue driven primarily by a focus on service offerings that provide mentorship on simulation best practices training and expanding simulation adoption increased 75 or 68 in constant currency as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 perpetual license revenue which is derived primarily from new sales during the year ended december 31 2020 decreased 44 or 54 in constant currency as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 

we continue to experience increased interest by some of our larger customers in enterprise agreements that often include longerterm timebased licenses involving a larger number of our software products while these arrangements typically involve a higher overall transaction price the upfront recognition of license revenue related to these larger multiyear transactions can result in significantly higher lease license revenue volatility software products across a large variety of applications and industries are increasingly distributed in softwareasaservice cloud and other subscription environments in which the licensing approach is timebased rather than perpetual resulting in shifting preferences from perpetual licenses to timebased licenses across a broader spectrum of our customers this dynamic was elevated in 2020 as a result of the economic impacts of covid19 and we expect it to continue into the foreseeable future 

in relation to covid19 and our revenue we currently expect a recovery in the business environment as reliable vaccines become more readily available globally businesses have not resumed full operations and our teams and those of our customers will likely continue working remotely into 2021 as a result of social distancing our inperson demand generation events and those of our channel partners have been canceled while we have adjusted to have a stronger digital focus as evidenced by our hosting of our annual sales conference virtually in january the absence of certain events has had and is expected to continue to have an adverse impact on our results especially for certain channel partners in addition we have experienced delays in the timing of closing certain transactions including large enterprisetype deals these deals are often multiyear leases which have a significant impact on our operating results due to upfront revenue recognition of the license we expect this trend to continue and anticipate that customers will delay certain purchases reduce the size of planned purchases or forgo purchases that otherwise were expected to occur additional waves or mutated variants of covid19 could result in renewed shutdowns that stop or regress economic recovery

acquisition accounting for deferred revenue historically we have consummated acquisitions in order to support our strategic and other business objectives in accordance with the fair value provisions applicable to the accounting for business combinations acquired deferred revenue is often recorded on the opening balance sheet at an amount that is lower than the historical carrying value although this acquisition accounting requirement has no impact on our business or cash flow it adversely impacts our reported gaap revenue in the reporting periods following an acquisition in order to provide investors with financial information that facilitates comparison of both historical and future results we provide nongaap financial measures which exclude the impact of the acquisition accounting adjustment we believe that this nongaap financial adjustment is useful to investors because it allows investors to a evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by us in our financial and operational decisionmaking and b compare our past and future reports of financial results as the revenue reduction related to acquired deferred revenue will not recur when related lease licenses and software maintenance contracts are renewed in future periods

tax cuts and jobs act we recorded impacts to our income tax provision related to the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 specifically for the transition tax related to unrepatriated cash we exclude these impacts for the purpose of calculating nongaap net income and nongaap diluted earnings per share when we evaluate our continuing operational performance as i the charges are not expected to recur as part of our normal operations and ii the charges resulted from the extremely infrequent event of major us tax reform the last such reform having occurred in 1986 we believe that these nongaap financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to a evaluate our operating results and the effectiveness of the methodology used by us to review our operating results and b review historical comparability in our financial reporting 

nongaap tax provision we utilize a normalized nongaap annual effective tax rate aetr to calculate nongaap measures this methodology provides better consistency across interim reporting periods by eliminating the effects of nonrecurring items and aligning the nongaap tax rate with our expected geographic earnings mix to project this rate we analyzed our historic and projected nongaap earnings mix by geography along with other factors such as our current tax structure recurring tax credits and incentives and expected tax positions on an annual basis we will reevaluate this rate for significant items that may materially affect our projections 

nongaap financial measures are not in accordance with or an alternative for gaap our nongaap financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable gaap financial measures and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap

liquidity and capital resources 



cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of highly liquid investments such as money market funds and deposits held at major banks shortterm investments consist primarily of deposits held by certain of our foreign subsidiaries with original maturities of three months to one year the following table presents our foreign and domestic holdings of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments 



in general it is our intention to permanently reinvest all earnings in excess of previously taxed amounts substantially all of the pre2018 earnings of our nonus subsidiaries were taxed through the transition tax and post2018 current earnings are taxed as part of global intangible lowtaxed income tax expense these taxes increase our previously taxed earnings and allow for the repatriation of the majority of our foreign earnings without any residual us federal tax while we believe that the financial reporting bases may be greater than the tax bases of investments in foreign subsidiaries for any earnings in excess of previously taxed amounts such amounts are considered permanently reinvested the cumulative temporary difference related to such permanently reinvested earnings is approximately 930 million and we would anticipate the tax effect on those earnings to be immaterial 

the amount of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments held by foreign subsidiaries is subject to translation adjustments caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period the offset to which is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet 

cash flows from operating activities 



fiscal year 2020 as compared to fiscal year 2019 

net cash provided by operating activities increased during the current fiscal year due to increased net income net of noncash operating adjustments of 258 million and increased net cash flows from operating assets and liabilities of 216 million the growth in net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by strong customer receipts in the fourth quarter including both the recovery of payments delayed from earlier in the year due to covid19 as well as the receipt of payments that were scheduled to be received in 2021 the growth was further aided by our ability to delay certain income employment and indirect tax payments to 2021 despite the strong cash flow as the covid19 crisis lengthens we continue to experience longerterm payment requests particularly related to larger contract commitments 

fiscal year 2019 as compared to fiscal year 2018 

net cash provided by operating activities increased during the prior fiscal year due to increased net income net of noncash operating adjustments of 1074 million partially offset by decreased net cash flows from operating assets and liabilities of 924 million

net cash used in investing activities decreased during the current fiscal year due primarily to decreased acquisitionrelated net cash outlays of 2149 million and decreased capital expenditures of 96 million we currently plan capital spending of 300 million to 400 million during fiscal year 2021 as compared to the 354 million that was spent in fiscal year 2020 the level of spending will depend on various factors including the growth of the business general economic conditions and the on going impact of covid19 

fiscal year 2019 as compared to fiscal year 2018 

net cash used in investing activities increased during the prior fiscal year due primarily to increased acquisitionrelated net cash outlays of 5042 million and increased capital expenditures of 232 million 

cash flows from financing activities 



fiscal year 2020 as compared to fiscal year 2019 

net cash provided by financing activities decreased during the current fiscal year due primarily to 5000 million in proceeds from longterm debt incurred in fiscal year 2019 related to the lst acquisition of which 750 million was repaid in 2020 prior to its maturity date increased stock repurchases of 1019 million and increased restricted stock withholding taxes paid in lieu of issuing shares of 286 million partially offset by 3750 million in proceeds from longterm debt incurred in fiscal year 2020 related to the agi acquisition 

fiscal year 2019 as compared to fiscal year 2018

other commitments  term loan facilities and operating lease obligations 

as of december 31 2020 the carrying values of our term loans were 7981 million which is net of 19 million of unamortized debt issuance costs borrowings under the term loans accrue interest at the eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin or at the base rate at our election the base rate is the applicable margin plus the highest of i the federal funds rate plus 0500 ii the bank of america prime rate and iii the eurodollar rate plus 1000 the applicable margin for these borrowings is a percentage per annum based on the lower of 1 a pricing level determined by our thencurrent consolidated leverage ratio and 2 a pricing level determined by our debt ratings if such debt ratings exist the scheduled maturities of the term loans are as follows 



we previously entered into noncancellable operating lease commitments primarily for our domestic and international offices as well as certain operating equipment the commitments related to these operating leases are as follows 



other cash flow information 

we believe that existing cash and cash equivalent balances of 9127 million together with cash generated from operations and access to the 5000 million revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements through the next twelve months our cash requirements in the future may also be financed through additional equity or debt financings however future disruptions in the capital markets could make financing more challenging and there can be no assurance that such financing can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

we also believe that our liquidity will allow us to manage the anticipated impact of covid19 on our business operations for the foreseeable future however our 2020 operating cash flow benefited from cash receipts from customer payments originally scheduled to be paid in fy 2021 as well as customer receipts from december transactions that would have traditionally been paid in the following fiscal year these activities collectively increased our fy 2020 operating cash flow and will decrease our fy 2021 operating cash flow by approximately 250 million additionally fy 2020 operating cash flow benefited from 310 million related to the timing of various tax payments 140 million of which will be due in 2021 resulting in a further shifting of operating cash flow between these two periods 

under our stock repurchase program we repurchased shares as follows 



table of content s 

all of the shares of common stock repurchased during the year ended december 31 2020 were repurchased in the first quarter as of december 31 2020 28 million shares remained available for repurchase under the program 

the authorized repurchase program does not have an expiration date and the pace of the repurchase activity will depend on factors such as working capital needs cash requirements for acquisitions our stock price and economic and market conditions our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases or pursuant to a rule 10b51 plan 

we continue to generate positive cash flows from operating activities and believe that the best uses of our excess cash are to invest in the business acquire or make investments in complementary companies products services and technologies and make payments on our outstanding debt balances any future acquisitions may be funded by available cash and investments cash generated from operations debt financing or the issuance of additional securities additionally we have in the past and expect in the future to repurchase stock in order to both offset dilution and return capital in excess of our requirements to stockholders with the goal of increasing stockholder value 

offbalancesheet arrangements 

we do not have any specialpurpose entities or offbalancesheet arrangements

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition  our revenue is derived principally from the licensing of computer software products and from related maintenance contracts we enter into contracts that include combinations of products maintenance and services which are accounted for as separate performance obligations with differing revenue recognition patterns 

revenue from perpetual licenses is classified as software license revenue software license revenue is recognized up front upon delivery of the licensed product andor the utility that enables the customer to access authorization keys provided that an enforceable contract has been received typically our perpetual licenses are sold with postcontract support pcs which includes unspecified technical enhancements and customer support we allocate value in bundled perpetual and pcs arrangements based on the standalone selling prices of the perpetual license and pcs revenue from pcs is classified as maintenance revenue and is recognized ratably over the term of the contract as we satisfy the pcs performance obligation over time 

in addition to perpetual licenses we sell timebased lease licenses lease licenses are sold only as a bundled arrangement that includes the rights to a term software license and pcs utilizing observable inputs we determined that 50 of the estimated standalone selling price of the lease license is attributable to the term license and 50 is attributable to the pcs this determination considered the value relationship for our products between pcs and timebased lease licenses the value relationship between pcs and perpetual licenses the average economic life of our products software renewal rates and the price of the bundled arrangement in relation to the perpetual licensing approach consistent with the perpetual sales the license component is classified as software license revenue and recognized as revenue up front at the commencement of the lease upon delivery of the licensed product andor utility that enables the customer to access authorization keys the pcs is classified as maintenance revenue and is recognized ratably over the term of the contract as we satisfy the pcs performance obligation over time 

revenue from training support and other services is recognized as the services are performed for contracts in which the service consists of a single performance obligation such as providing a training class to a customer we recognize revenue upon completion of the performance obligation for service contracts that are longer in duration and often include multiple performance obligations for example both training and consulting we measure the progress toward completion of the obligations and recognize revenue accordingly in measuring progress towards the completion of performance obligations we typically utilize outputbased estimates for services with contractual billing arrangements that are not based on time and materials and estimate output based on the total tasks completed as compared to the total tasks required for each work contract inputbased estimates are utilized for services that involve general consultations with contractual billing arrangements based on time and materials utilizing direct labor as the input measure proceeds from customers for the purpose of expediting roadmap items developing new products or creating specific features and functionality for existing products are classified as revenue 

we also execute arrangements through independent channel partners in which the channel partners are authorized to market and distribute our software products to end users of our products and services in specified territories in sales facilitated by channel partners the channel partner bears the risk of collection from the enduser customer we recognize revenue from transactions with channel partners in a manner consistent with the direct sales described above for both perpetual and timebased licenses revenue from channel partner transactions is the amount remitted to us by the channel partners this amount includes a fee for pcs that is compensation for providing technical enhancements and the second level of technical support to the end user which is recognized over the period that pcs is to be provided 

nonincome related taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as accounts receivable and accrued expenses the collection and payment of these amounts are reported on a net basis in the consolidated statements of income and do not impact reported revenues or expenses 

we do not offer right of return we warrant to our customers that our software will perform substantially as specified in our current user manuals we have not experienced significant claims related to software warranties beyond the scope of maintenance support which we are already obligated to provide the warranty is not sold and cannot be purchased separately the warranty does not provide any type of additional service to the customer or performance obligation for us 

our agreements with our customers generally require us to indemnify the customer against claims that our software infringes thirdparty patent copyright trademark or other proprietary rights such indemnification obligations are generally limited in a variety of industrystandard respects including our right to replace an infringing product 

table of content s 

significant judgments 

our contracts with customers typically include promises to transfer licenses and services to a customer judgment is required to determine if the promises are separate performance obligations and if so to allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation we use the estimated standalone selling price method to allocate the transaction price for each performance obligation the estimated standalone selling price is determined using all information reasonably available to us including market conditions and other observable inputs the corresponding revenues are recognized as the related performance obligations are satisfied 

we apply a practical expedient to expense sales commissions as incurred when the amortization period would have been one year or less sales commissions associated with the initial year of multiyear contracts are expensed as incurred due to their immateriality sales commissions associated with multiyear contracts beyond the initial year are subject to an employee service requirement and are expensed as incurred as they are not considered incremental costs to obtain a contract 

we are required to adjust promised amounts of consideration for the effects of the time value of money if the timing of the payments provides the customer or us with a significant financing benefit we consider various factors in assessing whether a financing component exists including the duration of the contract market interest rates and the timing of payments our contracts do not include a significant financing component requiring adjustment to the transaction price 

goodwill and other intangible assets  we test goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment at least annually by performing a quantitative assessment of whether the fair value of each reporting unit or asset exceeds its carrying amount we have one reporting unit goodwill is tested at this reporting unit level and indefinitelived intangible assets are tested at the individual asset level this requires us to assess and make judgments regarding a variety of factors which impact the fair value of the reporting unit or asset being tested including business plans anticipated future cash flows economic projections and other market data because there are inherent uncertainties involved in these factors significant differences between these estimates and actual results could result in future impairment charges and could materially impact our future financial results 

during the first quarter of 2020 we completed the annual impairment test for goodwill and the indefinitelived intangible asset and determined that these assets had not been impaired as of the test date january 1 2020 given the adverse economic and market conditions caused by covid19 we considered a variety of qualitative factors to determine if an additional quantitative impairment test was required subsequent to our annual impairment test based on a variety of factors including the excess of the fair values over the carrying amounts in the most recent impairment test we determined it was not more likely than not that an impairment existed as of march 31 2020 no other events or circumstances changed during the year ended december 31 2020 that would indicate that the fair values of our reporting unit and indefinitelived intangible asset are below their carrying amounts 

intangible assets are recognized apart from goodwill whenever an acquired intangible asset arises from contractual or other legal rights or whenever it is capable of being separated or divided from the acquired entity and sold transferred licensed rented or exchanged either individually or in combination with a related contract asset or liability we determined the fair value of our intangible assets using various valuation techniques including the relieffromroyalty method and the multiperiod excess earnings method these models utilize certain unobservable inputs classified as level 3 measurements as defined by asc 820 fair value measurements and disclosures  the determination of fair value requires considerable judgment and is sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions estimates and market factors estimating fair value requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans as well as industry and economic conditions these assumptions and estimates include but are not limited to royalty rate discount rate and attrition rate the fair values of the intangible assets will be amortized over their useful lives impairment losses are recognized if the carrying amounts of finitelived intangible assets are both not recoverable and exceed the fair values 

income taxes  we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period of the enactment date 

we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized in making such determination we consider all available positive and negative evidence including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and recent financial operations in the event we determine that we will be able to realize deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance was used to reduce their carrying value the adjustment to the valuation allowance will be recorded as a reduction to the provision for income taxes 

table of content s 

tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a morelikelythannot threshold otherwise these tax benefits are recorded when a tax position has been effectively settled which means that the statute of limitations has expired or the appropriate taxing authority has completed its examination even though the statute of limitations remains open 

we recognize interest and penalties related to income taxes within the income tax expense line in the consolidated statements of income accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheets 

stockbased compensation  we grant restricted stock units and other stock awards to employees and directors under our equity incentive plan eligible employees can also purchase shares of our common stock at a discount under our employee stock purchase plan the benefits provided under these plans are stockbased payments subject to the provisions of stockbased payment accounting guidance we use the fair value method to apply the provisions of stockbased payment accounting guidance stockbased compensation expense for 2020 2019 and 2018 was 1456 million 1162 million and 833 million respectively as of december 31 2020 total unrecognized estimated compensation expense related to awards granted prior to that date was 1607 million which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 14 years 

prior to 2017 we granted stock option awards the value of each stock option award was estimated on the date of grant or date of acquisition for options issued in a business combination using the blackscholes option pricing model blackscholes model the determination of the fair value of stockbased payment awards using an option pricing model was affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables these variables included our stock volatility during the preceding six years actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors interest rate assumptions using the fiveyear us treasury note yield on the date of grant or acquisition date and expected dividends the stockbased compensation expense for options was recorded ratably over the requisite service period as of december 31 2020 all stock options are fully vested and all expense has been recognized accordingly 

we issue various restricted stock unit awards which contain either a market condition a performance condition a service condition or certain combinations of the three restricted stock unit awards are valued based on the grantdate fair value of the award stockbased compensation expense is recognized over the employees requisite service period for awards with only a service condition 

awards with performance conditions are granted over three oneyear subperformance periods stockbased compensation expense is recognized from the grant date through the end of the threeyear performance period contingent upon continued employment and managements estimates concerning the probability of vesting 

at times the compensation committee may grant longterm performance awards stock based compensation expense for these awards is recognized over the performance period from the grant date through the end of the performance period contingent upon continued employment and managements estimates concerning the probability of vesting 

vesting of restricted stock unit awards with a market condition is based on our performance as measured by total stockholder return relative to the appreciation of a specified stock index over the measurement period subject to each participants continued employment through the conclusion of the measurement period the fair value of the restricted stock unit awards with a market condition is estimated using a monte carlo simulation model the determination of the fair value of the awards is affected by the grant date and several variables each of which has been identified in the chart below stockbased compensation expense based on the fair value of the award is recorded from the grant date through the conclusion of the measurement period 



we also grant restricted stock units to nonemployee directors which vest upon the earlier of one year from the date of grant or the date of the next regular annual meeting of stockholders if a nonemployee director retires prior to the vest date the nonemployee director receives a prorata portion of the restricted stock units 

table of content s 

to the extent we change the terms of our stockbased compensation programs experience market volatility in the pricing of our common stock that increases the implied volatility assumption used in the pricing models refine different assumptions or assume stock awards from acquired companies that are different in nature than our stock award arrangements among other potential impacts the stockbased compensation expense recorded in future periods and the related tax benefits may differ significantly from what was recorded in previous reporting periods forfeitures of awards are accounted for as they occur 

estimates of stockbased compensation expense are significant to our financial statements but this expense is partially based on the aforementioned option valuation and monte carlo simulation models and will never result in the payment of cash by us other than through the payment of withholding taxes in lieu of additional share issuance for this reason and because we do not view stockbased compensation as related to our operational performance the board of directors and management exclude stockbased compensation expense when evaluating our underlying business performance 

contingencies  we are involved in various investigations claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business including commercial disputes labor and employment matters tax audits alleged infringement of intellectual property rights and other matters we review the status of these matters assess our financial exposure and record a related accrual if the potential loss from an investigation claim or legal proceeding is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable significant judgment is involved in the determination of probability and in the determination of whether an exposure is reasonably estimable as a result of the uncertainties involved in making these estimates we may have to revise our estimates as facts and circumstances change the revision of these estimates could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk  changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest income that is generated from our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments and the interest expense that is generated from our outstanding borrowings for the year ended december 31 2020 interest income was 51 million and interest expense was 110 million cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of highly liquid investments such as money market funds and deposits held at major banks shortterm investments consist primarily of deposits held by certain foreign subsidiaries with original maturities of three months to one year 

foreign currency transaction risk as we operate in international regions a portion of our revenue expenses cash accounts receivable and payment obligations are denominated in foreign currencies as a result changes in currency exchange rates will affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows the currency exchange rate volatility due to covid19 has increased our foreign currency transaction risk 

with respect to revenue on average for the year ended december 31 2020 the us dollar was approximately 24 weaker when measured against our primary foreign currencies than for the year ended december 31 2019 the table below presents the impacts of currency fluctuations on revenue for the year ended december 31 2020 amounts in brackets indicate a net adverse impact from currency fluctuations 



the impacts from currency fluctuations resulted in increased operating income of 120 million for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 

the most significant currency impacts on revenue and operating income are typically attributable to us dollar exchange rate changes against the euro and japanese yen historical exchange rates for these currency pairs are reflected in the charts below

 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures  as required by rules 13a15 and 15d15 of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended or the exchange act we have evaluated with the participation of management including the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation the chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures are effective as defined in rule 13a15e of the exchange act 

we completed our acquisition of agi on december 1 2020 and have not yet included agi in our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting accordingly pursuant to the secs general guidance that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted from the scope of an assessment in the year of acquisition the scope of our assessment of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures does not include agi as of and for the year ended december 31 2020 agi represented 134 of our consolidated assets and accounted for less than 1 of our consolidated revenues 

we believe based on our knowledge that the financial statements and other financial information included in this report fairly present in all material respects our financial condition results of operations and cash flows as of and for the periods presented in this report we are committed to both a sound internal control environment and to good corporate governance 

from time to time we review the disclosure controls and procedures and may periodically make changes to enhance their effectiveness and to ensure that our systems evolve with our business 

managements annual report on internal control over financial reporting  management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rule 13a15f under the supervision and with the participation of management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer we have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based upon the internal control – integrated framework 2013 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

we completed our acquisition of agi on december 1 2020 in conducting our evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of december 31 2020 we excluded agi from our evaluation for the year ended december 31 2020 as permitted under current securities and exchange commission rules and regulations as of and for the year ended december 31 2020 agi represented 134 of consolidated assets and accounted for less than 1 of our consolidated revenues we are currently in the process of integrating and assessing the internal controls over financial reporting of agi with the rest of our company the integration may lead to changes in future periods but we do not expect these changes to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting we expect to complete this integration during 2021 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate our system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to management and the board of directors regarding the reliability of financial records used in preparation of our published financial statements as all internal control systems have inherent limitations even systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation based on this evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective at december 31 2020 

additionally deloitte  touche llp an independent registered public accounting firm has audited the financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k and has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting this report is included in item 15 of this annual report on form 10k

product quality 

our employees generally perform product development tasks according to predefined quality plans procedures and work instructions certain technical support tasks are also subject to a quality process these plans define for each project the methods to be used the responsibilities of project participants and the quality objectives to be met the majority of software products are developed under a quality system that is certified to the iso 90012015 standard we establish quality plans for our products and services and subject product designs to multiple levels of testing and verification in accordance with processes established under our quality system 

sales and marketing 

we distribute and support our products through our own direct sales offices as well as a global network of independent channel partners this channel partner network provides us with a costeffective highlyspecialized channel of distribution and technical support it also enables us to draw on business and technical expertise from a global network provides relative stability to our operations to help mitigate geographyspecific economic trends and provides us with an opportunity to take advantage of new geographic markets or enhance our sales coverage in existing markets 

the channel partners sell our products to new customers expand installations within the existing customer base offer training and consulting services and provide the first line of our technical support our channel partner certification process helps to ensure that each channel partner has the ongoing capability to adequately represent our expanding product lines and to provide an acceptable level of training consultation and customer support we derived 229  224 and 248 of our total revenue through the indirect sales channel for the years ended december 31 2019  2018 and 2017  respectively 

we also have a direct sales organization to develop an enterprisewide focused sales approach and to implement a worldwide gotomarket account strategy the sales management organization also functions as a focal point for requests from the channel partners and provides additional support in strategic locations through the presence of direct sales offices 

during 2019  we continued to invest in our existing domestic and international strategic sales offices in total our direct sales organization comprised 2100 and 1700 employees as of december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively who were responsible for the sales technical support consulting services marketing initiatives and administrative activities designed to support our overall revenue growth and expansion strategies 

our products are utilized by organizations ranging in size from small consulting firms to the worlds largest industrial companies no single customer accounted for more than 5 of our revenue in 2019  2018 or 2017  

information with respect to foreign and domestic revenue may be found in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k and in the section entitled “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in part ii item 7 of this annual report on form 10k 

strategic alliances and marketing relationships 

we have established and continued to pursue strategic alliances with advanced technology suppliers cloud computing providers hardware vendors specialized application developers and cad ecad and plm providers we believe that these relationships facilitate accelerated incorporation of advanced technology into our products provide access to new customers expand our sales channels develop specialized product applications and provide direct integration with leading cad electronic design automation eda product data management and plm systems 

we have technical and marketing relationships with leading cad vendors such as autodesk ptc and siemens digital industries to provide direct links between products these links facilitate the transfer of electronic data models between the cad systems and our products 

we partnered with ptc to accelerate product innovation by providing customers a worldclass simulationdriven design solution working together we are delivering ansys discovery live realtime simulation within ptc’s creo ® 3d cad software the combined solution creo simulation live is sold by ptc as part of the creo product suite this solution offers customers a unified modeling and simulation environment removing the boundaries between cad and simulation and enabling design engineers to gain insight into each of the many design decisions they make throughout the product development process this insight enables design engineers to create higher quality products while reducing product and development costs 

similarly we maintain marketing and software development relationships with leading eda software companies including cadence design systems synopsys mentor graphics zuken and national instruments these relationships support the transfer of data between electronics design and layout software and our electronics simulation portfolio in 2017 we entered into an integration and distribution agreement with synopsys to cooperatively integrate ansys redhawk technology into an indesign addon to a synopsys design tool for the primary purpose of providing customers with direct indesign access to the redhawk technologys capabilities 

we also have relationships with siemens and spatial corporation to provide the 3d modeling kernel and format translation technologies upon which our inhouse geometry modeling software solutions are built 

the main method we employ to democratize hpc to a wider audience is through partnerships with a number of companies such as cloud computing providers hpc hardware manufacturers and supercomputing centers such as hlrs in stuttgart 

germany in 2019 we launched a new cloud service fully managed by us and developed in collaboration with microsoft azure that provides ondemand access to hpc directly from within our flagship applications we also collaborated with flexera to improve our elastic licensing solution by now supporting onpremise use and internetbased usage monitoring we added hewlett packard enterprises and dell technologies as new members to the hpc appliance program that is designed to simplify and accelerate hpc cluster deployment 

our open cloud strategy allows us to work with various public cloud providers and cloudhosting partners this approach makes it easy for customers to use the same workflows onpremise and in the cloud cloudhosting partners such as nimbix rescale and gompute provide cloud access to us andor thirdparty applications for customers having very complex workflows or other restrictive security certification requirements furthermore we continued to enjoy mutuallycommitted alliances with large cloud platform providers such as microsoft aws google and alibaba in 2018 we entered into an agreement with sap se sap to embed our pervasive simulation solutions for digital twins into saps marketleading digital supply chain manufacturing and asset management portfolio the partnerships first solution launched in 2019 and runs on the sap cloud platform and empowers industrial asset operators to optimize operations and maintenance through realtime engineering insights which reduces product cycle times and increases profitability 

our partner program actively encourages developers of specialized software solutions to use our technology as a development platform for their applications and provides customers with enhanced functionality related to their use of our software with more than 200 active solution partnerships spanning a wide range of technologies including materials optimization electronics optical mechanical fluid and systems simulation our partner ecosystem extends the depth and breadth of our technology offerings 

we have a software license agreement with hbm that provides the advanced fatigue capabilities of ncode designlife™ a leading durability software from hbm ncode designlife™ technology leverages the open architecture of our platform and enables mechanical engineers to more easily address complex product life and durability issues before a prototype is built a similar agreement was executed with virtualmotion to offer ansys motion™ as a tightlyintegrated nextgeneration capability for simulating complex multibody mechanisms and assemblies 

competition 

we believe that the principal factors affecting sales of our software include ease of use breadth and depth of functionality flexibility quality ease of integration with other software systems file compatibility across computer platforms range of supported computer platforms performance price and total cost of ownership customer service and support company reputation and financial viability and effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts 

we continue to experience competition across all markets for our products and services our competitors include large global publicly traded companies small geographicallyfocused firms startup firms and solutions produced inhouse by the end users some of our current and possible future competitors have greater financial technical marketing and other resources than us and some have wellestablished relationships with current and potential customers of ours our current and possible future competitors also include firms that have elected or may in the future elect to compete by means of open source licensing these competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes price reductions andor increased operating costs and could result in lower revenues margins and net income 

proprietary rights and licenses 

we regard our software as proprietary and rely on a combination of trade secret copyright patent and trademark laws license agreements nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights in our products we distribute our software products under software license agreements that predominantly grant customers nonexclusive licenses which are typically nontransferable for the use of our products license agreements for our products are generally directly between us and end users use of the licensed software product is restricted to specified sites unless the customer obtains a multisite license for its use of the software product or the software product is by its nature a multisite use product software security measures are also employed to prevent unauthorized use of our software products and the licensed software is subject to terms and conditions prohibiting unauthorized use or reproduction for most products customers may purchase a perpetual license of the technology with the right to annually purchase ongoing maintenance technical support and upgrades or may lease the product on a fixedterm basis for a fee that includes the license maintenance technical support and upgrades for some products customers purchase an annual subscription for a certain number of named users that includes the license maintenance technical support and upgrades or purchase elastic units hosted by our cloud and use any supported product at any time until their licensed volume is met 

we license our software products utilizing a combination of webbased and hardcopy license terms and forms for certain software products we primarily rely on clickwrapped licenses ie online agreements where the website provider posts terms and conditions and the user clicks on the accept button the enforceability of these types of agreements under the laws of some jurisdictions is uncertain 

we also seek to protect the source code of our software as a trade secret and as registered unpublished copyrighted work we have obtained federal trademark registration protection for ansys and other marks in the us and foreign countries additionally we were awarded numerous patents by the us patent and trademark office and have a number of patent applications pending to the extent we do not choose to seek patent protection for our intellectual property we primarily rely on the protection of our source code as a trade secret we seek additional protection of our proprietary rights in our source code via copyright registrations 

our employees have signed agreements under which they have agreed not to disclose trade secrets or confidential information these agreements where legally permitted restrict engagement in or connection with any business that is competitive with us anywhere in the world while employed by us and in some cases for specified periods thereafter and state that any products or technology created by employees during their term of employment are our property in addition we require all channel partners to enter into agreements not to disclose our trade secrets and other proprietary information 

despite these precautions there can be no assurance that misappropriation of our technology and proprietary information including source code will be prevented further there can be no assurance that copyright trademark patent and trade secret protection will be available for our products in certain jurisdictions or that restrictions on the ability of employees and channel partners to engage in activities competitive with us will be enforceable costly and timeconsuming litigation could be necessary in the future to enforce our rights to our trade secrets and proprietary information or to enforce our patent rights and copyrights and it is possible that in the future our competitors may be able to obtain our trade secrets or to independently develop similar unpatented technology 

the software development industry is characterized by rapid technological change therefore we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel new product developments frequent product enhancements name recognition and reliable product maintenance are also important to establishing and maintaining technology leadership in addition to the various legal protections of our technology that may be available 

we do not believe that any of our products infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties there can be no assurance however that third parties will not claim such infringement by us or our licensors or licensees with respect to current or future products in addition there are nonpracticing entities npes and patent assertion entities paes whose business models are built on not producing any products but rather extracting payments from revenue generating companies through patent infringement assertions andor litigation we expect that software suppliers will increasingly be subject to the risk of such claims as the number of products and suppliers continues to expand and the functionality of products continues to increase any such claims with or without merit could be time consuming result in costly litigation cause product release delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements such royalty or licensing agreements if required may not be available on terms acceptable to us 

seasonal variations 

our business has experienced seasonality including quarterly reductions in software sales resulting from slowdowns of customer activities during the summer months particularly in europe as well as from the seasonal purchasing and budgeting patterns of our global customers lease and maintenance contract renewals are typically highest in the first and fourth quarters our revenue is typically highest in the fourth quarter 

deferred revenue and backlog 

deferred revenue consists of billings made or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from customer agreements the deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheets does not represent the total value of annual or multiyear noncancellable agreements our backlog represents installment billings for periods beyond the current quarterly billing cycle  our deferred revenue and backlog as of december 31 2019 and 2018 consisted of the following 





revenue associated with deferred revenue and backlog that will be recognized in the subsequent twelve months is classified as current in the tables above 

employees 

as of december 31 2019  we employed approximately 4100 people at that date there were also contract personnel and coop students providing ongoing development services and technical support certain employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements and have local work councils 

acquisitions 

we make targeted acquisitions in order to support our longterm strategic direction accelerate innovation provide increased capabilities to our existing products supply new products and services expand our customer base and enhance our distribution channels

risk factors 

tableend the following are important factors we have identified that could affect our future results and an investment in our common stock in addition from time to time we provide information including information contained in this annual report on form 10k that contains forwardlooking statements concerning among other things projected financial performance total addressable market market and industry sector growth product development and commercialization or other aspects of future operations such statements are based on the assumptions and expectations of our management at the time such statements are made we caution investors that our performance and any forwardlooking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties including but not limited to the following 

global operational risks 

adverse economic and geopolitical conditions may impact our operations and financial performance 

our operations and performance depend significantly on global macroeconomic specific foreign country and us domestic economic conditions adverse conditions in the macroeconomic environment may result in a decreased demand for our products and services constrained credit and liquidity reduced government spending and volatility in equity and foreign exchange markets in addition to the extent the global economy experiences a significant downturn or volatility we may be exposed to impairments of certain assets if their values deteriorate tighter credit due to economic conditions may diminish our future borrowing ability and increase borrowing costs under our existing credit facilities customers ability to pay for our products and services may also be impaired which could lead to an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts and writeoffs of accounts receivable 

a majority of our business comes from outside the us and our customers supply a wide array of goods and services to most of the world’s major economic regions international revenue represented 579  609 and 619 of our total revenue for the years ended december 31 2019  2018 and 2017  respectively in fiscal year 2019 our largest geographic revenue bases included the us japan germany and south korea 

if any of the foreign economies in which we do business deteriorates or suffers a period of uncertainty our business and performance may be negatively impacted through reduced customer and government spending changes in purchasing cycles or timing reduced access to credit for our customers or other factors impacting our international sales and collections furthermore customer spending levels in any foreign jurisdiction may be adversely impacted by changes in domestic policies including tax and trade policies for example the united kingdom withdrew from the european union effective as of january 31 2020 and is now in a period of transition until the end of 2020 we have significant operations in the united kingdom and the european union it remains unclear as to what the terms of the new relationship between the united kingdom and the european union will be terms that are disadvantageous to us including those related to trade tax and the movement of people across borders could negatively impact our results 

a substantial portion of our license and maintenance revenue is derived from annual lease and maintenance contracts which typically have a high rate of customer renewal if the rate of renewal for these contracts is adversely affected by economic or other factors our lease license and maintenance growth will be adversely affected as a result our business financial position results of operations and cash flows may also be adversely impacted during those periods 

we face compliance risk as a result of our international operations and our sales model including pertaining to anticorruption and data privacy laws 

the laws with which we need to comply due to our international operations vary from country to country and are subject to frequent change and interpretation in may 2018 the general data protection regulation gdpr which governs data privacy practices within the european economic area eea went into effect the law which applies to our data processing activities within the eea as well as the processing of eea citizen data globally imposes various compliance obligations related to the handling of personal data in the delivery of our products and services and to business operations involving employee data compliance with the gdpr has and will continue to require deployment of substantial resources and increased costs if we fail to comply with the gdpr it may lead to regulatory enforcement actions which can result in monetary penalties of up to 4 of annual worldwide revenue private lawsuits extensive and prescriptive consent decrees or judgments that may require additional resources or expenses for compliance and may cause reputational damage 

in the us california implemented the california consumer protection act ccpa as of january 2020 which requires compliance measures similar to those of the gdpr and establishes the first state standard for a comprehensive set of data privacy rights several other states have proposed data privacy laws that would impose obligations on us with respect to how we collect and use personal data including customer data in order to comply with us state laws as well as any data breach notification laws that vary across states we may be required to invest in additional resources or tools to manage our data 

processing activities if we fail to comply with the requirements of us data privacy and data breach notification laws we will be subject to state monetary fines consent decrees issued by the federal trade commission and possible reputational damage 

our global reach including within countries considered highrisk environments for public corruption exposes us to risks associated with violations of antibribery laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act we develop and sell software and consulting services and maintain support operations in more than 40 countries whose laws and practices differ from one another and are subject to unexpected changes managing these geographically diverse operations requires significant attention and resources to ensure compliance to promote compliance we forbid our agents and employees from engaging in corrupt behavior and have implemented a compliance plan to prevent and detect violations of anticorruption laws there remains however a risk that illegal conduct could occur thereby exposing us to the financial and reputational risks associated with a violation of anticorruption laws 

noncompliance with these regulations could adversely impact our financial results or stock price as well as divert management time and effort 

we are subject to trade restrictions that could impact our ability to sell to customers and result in liability for violations 

due to the global nature of our business we are subject to import and export restrictions and regulations that prohibit the shipment or provision of certain products and services to certain countries governments and persons targeted by the us including the export administration regulations administered by the us bureau of industry and security bis and economic and trade sanctions administered by the us treasury department’s office of foreign assets control ofac during the second quarter of 2019 the bis placed certain entities on the entity list certain of our existing and prospective customers including huawei were included in this list in addition restrictions implemented by ofac restrict our ability to sell to some companies in certain countries such as russia the entity list and ofac restrictions limit our ability to deliver products and services to these customers and in the absence of a license our ability to sell products and services to these customers in the future the inclusion of companies on the entity list may encourage them to seek substitute products from competitors who are not subject to these restrictions or to develop their own products we cannot predict whether or when any changes will be made that eliminate or decrease these limitations on our ability to sell products and provide services to these customers additionally other customers may continue to be added to the entity list andor be subjected to trade restrictions there may be indirect impacts that cannot be quantified including that our business may also be impacted by other trade restrictions that may be imposed by the us china or other countries restrictions on our ability to sell and ship to customers could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

violators of these export controls may be subject to significant penalties which may include considerable monetary fines criminal proceedings against them and their officers and employees a denial of export privileges and suspension or debarment from selling products or services to the federal government any such penalties could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition operating results and cash flows in addition the political and media scrutiny surrounding any governmental investigation could cause significant expense and reputational harm and distract senior executives from managing normal daytoday operations 

our products could also be shipped to denied parties by third parties including our channel partners even though we take precautions to ensure that our channel partners comply with all relevant import and export regulations any failure by channel partners to comply with such regulations could have negative consequences for us including reputational harm government investigations and penalties 

the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuation may adversely impact our revenue expenses cash flows and financial conditions 

as a result of our significant international presence we have revenue expenses cash accounts receivable and payment obligations denominated in foreign currencies most notably the british pound euro japanese yen south korean won and indian rupee our revenue and operating results are adversely affected when the us dollar strengthens relative to foreign currencies and are positively affected when the us dollar weakens relative to foreign currencies if the us dollar strengthens relative to other currencies certain channel partners who pay us in us dollars may have trouble paying on time or may have trouble distributing our products due to the impact of the currency exchange fluctuation on such channel partners cash flows this may impact our ability to distribute our products into certain regions and markets 

we seek to reduce our currency exchange transaction risks primarily through our normal operating and treasury activities including derivative instruments but there can be no assurance that these activities will be successful in reducing these risks in addition we incur transaction fees in the usage of such derivative instruments changes in currency exchange rates will affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

a natural disaster or catastrophic event may disrupt our business 

a significant portion of our software development personnel source code and computer equipment is located at operating facilities in the us canada india japan and throughout europe the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unforeseen catastrophe at any of these facilities could cause disruptions to our operations services and product development activities additionally if we experience problems that impair our business infrastructure such as a computer virus telephone system failure or an intentional disruption of our information technology systems by a third party these disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations cash flows and the ability to meet financial reporting deadlines further because our sales are not generally consistent across quarterly periods the potential adverse effects resulting from any of the events described above or any other disruption of our business could be accentuated if they occur close to the end of a fiscal quarter 

in addition our business could be adversely affected by the effects of a widespread outbreak of contagious disease including the recent outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus first identified in wuhan hubei province china any outbreak of contagious diseases and other adverse public health developments may cause us or our customers to temporarily suspend operations in the affected city or country in addition a significant outbreak of contagious diseases in the human population could result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries resulting in an economic downturn that could affect demand for our products our ability to collect against existing trade receivables and our operating results 

industry operational risks 

our industry is highly competitive which could result in downward pressure on our prices 

we continue to experience competition across all markets for our products and services some of our current and potential competitors have greater financial technical marketing and other resources than we do and some have wellestablished relationships with our current and potential customers our current and potential competitors also include firms that have competed or may in the future compete by means of open source licensing companies we have or could have strategic alliances with could reduce or discontinue technical software development and marketing relationships with us for competitive purposes if our competitors offer deep discounts on certain products or services or develop products that the marketplace considers more valuable we may need to lower prices or offer discounts or other favorable terms in order to compete successfully our maintenance products which include software license updates and product support fees are generally priced as a percentage of new software license fees our competitors may offer lower percentage pricing on product updates and support some competitors may bundle software products for promotional purposes or as a longterm pricing strategy or provide guarantees of prices product implementations or wider geographical license usage provisions any of these practices could over time significantly constrain the prices that we can charge for certain products 

furthermore if we do not adapt pricing models to reflect changes in customer usage of our products or changes in customer demand our new software license revenues could decrease additionally increased distribution of applications through application service providers including softwareasaservice providers may reduce the average price of our products or adversely affect other sales of our products reducing new software license revenues unless we can offset price reductions with volume increases 

these competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes price reductions andor increased operating costs and could result in lower revenues margins and net income 

we may not be successful in developing and marketing new products to adequately address the rapidly changing technology industry 

we operate in an industry generally characterized by rapidly changing technology and frequent new product introductions which can render existing products obsolete or unmarketable a major factor in our future success will be our ability to anticipate technological changes and to develop and introduce in a timely manner new products to meet those changes our ability to grow revenue will be dependent on our ability to respond to customer needs in the areas of among others 5g autonomous vehicles industrial internet of things iiot and electrification and to leverage cloud computing and new computing platforms in addition our future success may depend on our ability to continue to develop a systems integrator ecosystem able to handle integrations and process and application development to address the challenge of the increasingly complex integration of our products’ different functionalities to address customers’ requirements in addition for those customers who authorize a thirdparty technology partner to access their data we do not provide any warranty related to the functionality security and integrity of the data transmission or processing despite contract provisions to protect us customers may look to us to support and provide warranties for the thirdparty applications integrations data and content even though not developed or sold by us which may expose us to potential claims liabilities and obligations all of which could harm our business 

we devote substantial resources to research and development which could cause our operating results to decline 

we devote substantial resources to research and development new competitors technological advances in the software development industry by us or our competitors acquisitions entry into new markets or other competitive factors may require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated if we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated without a corresponding increase in revenue operating results could decline in addition our periodic research and development expenses may be independent of our level of revenue which could negatively impact financial results 

there can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing and marketing on a timely basis new products or product enhancements or that the new products will adequately address the changing needs of the marketplace or that we will successfully manage the transition from existing products software products as complex as those we offer may contain undetected errors when first introduced or as new versions are released and the likelihood of errors is increased as a result of our commitment to the frequency of product releases there can be no assurance that errors will not be found in any new or enhanced products after the commencement of commercial shipments certain products require a higher level of sales and support expertise failure of our sales channel particularly the independent channel partners to obtain this expertise and to sell the new product offerings effectively could have an adverse impact on our sales in future periods any of these problems may result in the loss of or delay in customer acceptance diversion of development resources damage to our reputation or increased service and warranty costs any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

consolidation among our customers as well as our industry competitors may negatively impact our operating results 

there have been consolidations among our customers in the semiconductor electronics and automotive industries among others this may result in the newly combined entity wanting the most favorable pricing from the former contracts and expecting larger volume discounts on future purchases if a customer is acquired by an entity that does not utilize our products in favor of a competing product we may not have future orders from the enterprise further consolidation of our competitors may result in synergies that allow those competitors to benefit from broader sales channels and increased access to capital any of these impacts could adversely affect our business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

the price of our common stock is subject to volatility 

the market price of securities of software companies is subject to significant fluctuations the valuation and trading price of our common stock may not be predictable factors that may adversely impact our share price include our failure to meet analyst expectations reduced expectations regarding financial outlook increases in our debt levels changes in management or our material announcements or those of our competitors in addition volatility could result from causes that are unrelated to our operating performance such as conditions in the financial markets or the software industry generally 

company operational risks 

we are dependent upon our channel partners for a significant percentage of our revenue 

we distribute our products through a global network of independent channel partners which accounted for 229  224 and 248 of our revenue during the years ended december 31 2019  2018 and 2017  respectively channel partners sell our software products to new and existing customers expand installations within the existing customer base offer consulting 

services and provide the first line of technical support in asiapacific and emea we are highly dependent upon our channel partners difficulties in ongoing relationships with channel partners such as failure to meet performance criteria and differences in handling customer relationships could adversely affect our performance additionally the loss of any major channel partner including a channel partners decision to sell competing products rather than ours could result in reduced revenue moreover our future success will depend substantially on the ability and willingness of our channel partners to dedicate the resources necessary to promote our portfolio of products and to support a larger installed base within each of our geographic regions if the channel partners are unable or unwilling to do so we may be unable to sustain revenue growth 

we have been increasing the number of channel partners particularly in international locations the business relationships with these channel partners are recently established and could result in additional compliance burdens for us in addition these partners have a lessestablished payment history and revenue from these partners could come with a higher rate of bad debt expense where channel partners operate on our behalf to collect and process personal data of customer contacts failure to comply with relevant data privacy laws in the handling of such personal data could result in our liability for any fines civil suits or nonfinancial performance obligations imposed by regulatory authorities on these partners with respect to our customer data 

we may not be able to realize the potential benefit of our acquisitions and such acquisitions could pose risks to our business 

we consummate acquisitions to support our longterm strategic direction we have completed a number of acquisitions in recent years and in 2019 we acquired granta design helic dfr solutions lst and dynardo 

any acquisitions that we complete may present risks including difficulty in integrating the management teams strategies cultures and operations of the companies or businesses failing to achieve anticipated synergies revenue increases or cost savings difficulty incorporating and integrating the acquired technologies or products with our existing product lines difficulty with sales distribution and marketing functions failure to develop new products and services that utilize the technologies and resources of the companies disruption of our ongoing business and diversion of managements attention to transition or integration issues liabilities that were not identified during the buying process the loss of our key employees customers partners and channel partners or those of the acquired company and cybersecurity and data privacy risks including any liabilities for failure to comply with data privacy laws and obligations for collection use and retention of personal data 

future acquisitions may involve the expenditure of significant cash resources the incurrence of debt which increases our interest expense and leverage or the issuance of equity which is dilutive to stockholders and may decrease earnings per share 

we allocate a portion of the purchase price to goodwill and intangible assets if we do not recognize all the economic benefits of an acquisition there could be an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets furthermore impairment charges are generally not taxdeductible and will result in an increased effective income tax rate in the period the impairment is recorded 

if we do not achieve the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by our management or the financial and industry analysts there could be a material adverse effect on our stock price business financial position results of operations and cash flows where customer contacts and leads are a significant consideration in the purchase price or expected financial outcome of an acquisition failure to identify or mitigate data privacy concerns with the collection use and retention of personal data may adversely impact our ability to use this information as anticipated and regulatory obligations may require that we delete all or a portion of the database or take additional remediation measures before use this may impact the value of the acquisition or reduce forecasted sales 

the implementation of a new crm system may not achieve the corporate benefits initially identified in the anticipated time frame or at all 

we are in the process of implementing new functionality in our existing customer relationship management crm system while this system is anticipated to simplify the demand generation sales cycle order processing and customer service activities there is a risk that the project will not achieve the anticipated benefits or that the benefits will not be achieved as quickly as anticipated there is also a risk that we will have to write off previously capitalized expenditures if the project is not successful or if implementation decisions regarding the project are modified the project implementation timeline and scope may change and become longer and broader as new facets of the design and implementation efforts are undertaken this may take the attention of key operational management away from other aspects of the business including the integration of acquisitions and may also result in increased consulting and software costs these factors may have a significant negative impact on our business financial position profit cash flows and reputation 

if we are unable to attract and retain key talent our business could be adversely affected 

our success depends upon the continued service of our senior executives and our key technical and sales employees each of our executive officers and key technical personnel could terminate his or her relationship with us at any time the loss of any of our senior executives or key personnel for which there has not been adequate knowledgesharing and transfer might significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives and could materially harm our business and customer relationships 

in addition because of the highly technical nature of our products and services we must attract and retain highly skilled engineering and development personnel the market for this talent is highly competitive and we have difficulty filling these roles for this reason while we have historically recruited from outside of the us in recent years our ability to do so has been curbed by more restrictive domestic immigration laws if the immigration laws become even stricter or the processing of immigration requests becomes even more cumbersome or less efficient or if we have less success in recruiting and retaining key personnel our business reputation and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 

we may be subject to proceedings that could harm our business 

we are subject to various investigations claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business including commercial disputes labor and employment matters tax audits and litigations alleged infringement of intellectual property rights and other matters use or distribution of our products could generate product liability regulatory infraction or similar claims by our customers end users channel partners government entities or other third parties sales and marketing activities that impact processing of personal data as well as measures taken to ensure license compliance may also result in claims by customers and individual employees of customers each of these matters is subject to various uncertainties and it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could materially and adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial position as well as cause damage to our reputation 

we may not be able to continue to obtain licenses to thirdparty software and intellectual property on reasonable terms or at all which may disrupt our business and harm our financial results 

we license thirdparty software and other intellectual property for use in product research and development and in several instances for inclusion in our products we also license thirdparty software including the software of our competitors to test the interoperability of our products with other industry products and in connection with our professional services these licenses may need to be renegotiated or renewed from time to time or we may need to obtain new licenses in the future third parties may stop adequately supporting or maintaining their technology or they or their technology may be acquired by our competitors if we are unable to obtain licenses to such thirdparty software and intellectual property on reasonable terms or at all we may not be able to sell the affected products our customers’ use of the products may be interrupted or our product development processes and professional services offerings may be disrupted which could in turn harm our financial results our customers ability to utilize our software and our reputation 

we may suffer reputational or financial harm if we have product standard or quality issues 

we have separate quality systems and registrations under the iso 90012015 standard in addition to other governmental and industrial regulations our continued compliance with quality standards and favorable outcomes in periodic examinations is important to retain current customers and vital to procure new sales if it was determined that we were not in compliance with various regulatory or iso 9001 standards our certificates of registration could be suspended requiring remedial action and a timeconsuming reregistration process product quality issues or failures could result in our reputation becoming diminished resulting in a material adverse impact on revenue operating margins net income financial position and cash flows 

our shortterm and longterm sales forecast may not be accurate which could result in an adverse impact on our business 

the software business is generally characterized by long sales cycles these long sales cycles increase the difficulty of predicting sales for any particular quarter many operational and strategic decisions are based upon short and longterm sales forecasts our sales personnel continually monitor the status of proposals including the estimated closing date and the value of the sale in order to forecast quarterly sales these forecasts are subject to significant estimation and are impacted by many external factors including global economic conditions and the performance of our customers a variation in actual sales activity from that forecasted could cause us to plan or budget incorrectly and therefore could adversely affect our business financial position results of operations and cash flows management also forecasts macroeconomic trends and developments and integrates them through longrange planning into budgets research and development strategies and a wide variety of general management duties global economic conditions and the effect those conditions and any disruptions in global markets have on our customers may have a significant impact on the accuracy of our sales forecasts these conditions may increase the likelihood or the magnitude of variations between actual sales activity and our sales forecasts and as a result our performance may be hindered because of a failure to properly match corporate strategy with economic conditions this in turn may adversely affect our business financial position results of operations and cash flows to the extent our forecasts are incorrect and as a result we fail to meet analyst expectations regarding financial performance or miss or reduce the financial guidance we give to investors our share price may be adversely impacted 

intellectual property and cybersecurity risks 

our success is highly dependent upon the legal protection of our proprietary technology 

we primarily rely upon contracts and copyright patent trademark and trade secrets laws to protect our technology we maintain intellectual property programs including applying for patents registering trademarks and copyrights protecting trade secrets entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees and channel partners and limiting access to and distribution of our software documentation and other proprietary information however software programs are particularly prone to piracy which is a global phenomenon and as a result we may lose revenue from the distribution of unlicensed software additionally patent copyright trademark and trade secret protection do not provide the same coverage in every country in which we sell our products and services policing the unauthorized distribution and use of our products is difficult and software piracy including online piracy is a persistent problem while we continue to develop better mechanisms to detect and report or investigate unauthorized use of our software we are also constrained by data privacy laws that restrict our ability to collect data about unlawful usage in some countries we cannot assure that the steps we take to protect our proprietary technology are adequate to prevent misappropriation of our software by third parties or that third parties will not be able to develop similar technology independently despite our efforts to prevent such activities we may nonetheless lose significant revenue due to illegal use of our software 

costly and timeconsuming litigation would be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of trade secret rights and related confidentiality and nondisclosure provisions across our contractual agreements and partnerships while we are not aware that any of our technology infringes upon the rights of third parties there can be no assurance that other parties will not assert technology infringement claims against us or that if asserted such claims will not prevail any such litigation could be costly to defend damage our reputation and distract our employees from their daily work any successful infringement claims asserted against us could require us to develop technology workarounds for the impacted products or product development which could be costly disrupt product development and delay gotomarket activities such disruption and delay could negatively impact our financial results 

cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue increased costs liability claims or harm to our reputation 

while we undertake commercially reasonable efforts to maintain and improve the security and integrity of our products source code computer systems and data with respect to the relative sensitivity of such software systems and data the number of computer “hackers” developing and deploying destructive software programs that attack our products and computer systems continues to increase we have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs to enhance our cybersecurity efforts because the tactics and tools used to obtain unauthorized access to networks or to sabotage systems are constantly evolving we may be unable to implement adequate preventive measures such an attack could disrupt the proper functioning of our products cause errors in the output of our customers work or allow unauthorized access to and disclosure of our sensitive proprietary or confidential information or that of our customers and employees in the event of a serious breach of our products or systems or where a breach occurs due to our failure to implement reasonable and appropriate safeguards our reputation may suffer customers may stop buying products or may terminate current services we could face lawsuits and potential civil liability as well as regulatory fines and nonfinancial penalties for any personal data breach and our financial performance could be negatively impacted 

there is also a danger of industrial espionage cyberattacks misuse theft of information or assets including source code or damage to assets by people who have gained unauthorized access to our facilities systems or information this includes access to systems or information through email phishing attacks on our employees which has become a very prevalent technique used against companies often delaying detection through increasingly complex practices the objective of these attacks is often to acquire user account credentials in order to access other computer systems through linked accounts or where users have recycled passwords across systems 

inadequate security practices or inadvertent acts or omissions by our employees and partners may also result in unauthorized access to our data employees or third parties may also intentionally compromise our or our customers’ security or systems such cybersecurity breaches misuse of data or other disruptions could lead to loss of or unauthorized disclosure of our source code or other confidential information unlicensed use and distribution of our products without compensation illegal use of our products that could jeopardize the security of customer information stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and theft manipulation and destruction of proprietary data resulting in defective products performance downtimes and possible violation of export laws and other regulatory compliance requirements although we actively employ measures to combat such activities preventing unauthorized access to our systems and data is inherently difficult in addition litigation to either pursue our legal rights or defend any claims against us could be costly and timeconsuming and may divert managements attention and adversely affect the markets perception of us and our products 

we have experienced targeted and nontargeted cybersecurity attacks and incidents in the past that have resulted in unauthorized persons gaining access to our information and systems and we could in the future experience similar attacks to date no cybersecurity incident or attack has had a material impact on our business results of operations or financial condition 

a number of our core processes such as software development sales and marketing customer service and financial transactions rely on it infrastructure and applications we also rely on thirdparty service providers and products which are exposed to various security vulnerabilities outside of our control malicious software sabotage and other cybersecurity breaches of the types discussed above could cause an outage of our infrastructure which could cause shortterm disruption in operations or in the event of a longer disruption lead to a substantial denial of service to our customers and ultimately to production downtime recovery costs and customer claims for breach of contract as well as reputational damage and impact to employee morale and productivity 

we rely on service providers for infrastructure and cloudbased products 

we use a number of thirdparty service providers for key components of our infrastructure particularly with respect to development and delivery of our cloudbased products the utilization of these service providers gives us greater flexibility in efficiently delivering a more tailored scalable customer experience but also exposes us to additional risks and vulnerabilities those of our products and services that depend upon hosted components delivered by third parties are vulnerable to security risks inherent in webbased technologies including greater risk of unauthorized access to or use of customers’ protected data interception of data transmission misappropriation or modification of data corruption of data and attacks by bad actors against our service providers may also adversely affect our products or product and service delivery malicious code viruses or vulnerabilities that are undetected by our service providers may disrupt our business operations generally and may have a disproportionate effect on those of our products that are developed and delivered in the cloud environment these risks though largely outside our control may impact customer perception of our products service and support and may damage our brand while we devote resources to maintaining the security and integrity of our products and systems as well as ensuring adequate due diligence for our thirdparty service providers cloud security and reliability is inherently challenging in the event of a material breach of data hosted by our service providers or a serious security incident on behalf of caused by or experienced by a service provider we may experience significant operational and technical difficulties loss of data including customer data diminished competitive position or reputation and loss of customer engagement which could result in civil liabilities and a negative impact to financial performance 

financial risks 

our revenue is subject to increased volatility due to the adoption of a new revenue recognition accounting standard on january 1 2018 

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606  asu 201409 we adopted asu 201409 and its related amendments collectively known as accounting standards codification asc 606 on january 1 2018 which significantly impacted the timing allocation and presentation of our lease license perpetual license and maintenance revenue under previous revenue guidance revenue was recognized ratably from the sale of software lease licenses and software maintenance subscriptions however under asc 606 the license component of lease revenue is recognized up front the postcontract support portion of lease license contracts continues to be recognized over the contract term but it is now allocated to maintenance and service revenue 

we continue to sell perpetual licenses that involve the payment of a single upfront fee historically these licenses have been more typical in the computer software industry and remain as the preferred licensing approach in certain markets the revenue associated with perpetual licenses continues to be recognized up front consistent with prior revenue guidance 

the adoption of this revenue recognition guidance coupled with our continued sales of perpetual licenses creates the likelihood for software license revenue volatility to increase across periods particularly as compared to our results under the previous revenue recognition standard our revenue in any period will depend significantly on sales contracts completed during that period 

changes in existing financial accounting standards could adversely impact our financial results and operations 

changes in existing accounting rules or practices new accounting pronouncements or varying interpretations of current accounting pronouncements could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations or the manner in which we conduct our business 

in addition we could incur significant costs for changes to our business systems processes and internal controls as a result of the transition these costs could have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows the transition could also cause management to divert time from daytoday operations which could impact our business if we are unable to successfully transition our business systems processes and internal controls before the guidance effective date it could impact our ability to meet financial reporting deadlines for further information on the impact of recently issued accounting guidance see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k 

changes to tax laws variable tax estimates and tax authority audits could impact our financial results and operations 

our operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the us and in multiple foreign jurisdictions a change in the tax law in the jurisdictions in which we do business including an increase in tax rates an adverse change in the treatment of an item of income or expense or a decrease in tax rates in a jurisdiction in which we have significant deferred tax assets could result in a material increase in tax expense furthermore we have recorded significant deferred tax liabilities related to acquired intangible assets that are not deductible for tax purposes these deferred tax liabilities are based on future statutory tax rates in the locations in which the intangible assets are recorded any future changes in statutory tax rates would be recorded as an adjustment to the deferred tax liabilities in the period the change is announced and could have a material impact on our effective tax rate during that period 

we also make significant estimates in determining our worldwide income tax provision these estimates involve complex tax regulations in many jurisdictions and are subject to many transactions and calculations in which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain the outcome of tax matters could be different than the estimates reflected in the historical income tax provision and related accruals such differences could have a material impact on income tax expense and net income in the periods in which such determinations are made 

the amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities these audits can result in additional assessments including interest and penalties our estimates for liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions is highly judgmental and actual future outcomes may result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities including estimates for uncertain tax positions in the period the assessments are made or resolved audits are closed or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire as a result our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly or annual basis 

our indebtedness could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in connection with our acquisition of lst we borrowed 5000 million under a term loan facility which matures on november 1 2024 we also have access to a 5000 million revolving credit facility which includes a 500 million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit the credit agreement governing these loans contains customary representations and warranties affirmative and negative covenants and events of default the credit agreement also contains a financial covenant requiring us 

to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of indebtedness to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization not exceeding 350 to 100 as of the end of any fiscal quarter for the fourquarter period ending on such date with an opportunity for a temporary increase in such consolidated leverage ratio to 400 to 100 upon the consummation of certain qualified acquisitions for which the aggregate consideration is at least 2500 million 

notwithstanding the limits contained in the credit agreement governing our credit facility we may be able to incur substantial additional debt from time to time to finance working capital capital expenditures share repurchases investments or acquisitions or for other purposes if we do so the risks related to our level of debt could intensify specifically our level of debt could 

 any of the abovelisted factors could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt agreements 

furthermore borrowings under the credit agreement use the london interbank offering rate libor as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate libor has been the subject of recent national international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform and the financial industry is currently transitioning away from libor as a benchmark for the interbank lending market the consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted but could include an increase in the cost of our variable rate indebtedness

overview 

overall gaap and nongaap results 

our growth rates of gaap and nongaap results for the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31 2018 were as follows 



we experienced higher revenue during the year ended december 31 2019 from doubledigit growth in lease licenses maintenance and service partially driven by contributions from our recent acquisitions we also experienced increased operating expenses primarily due to increased personnel costs higher stockbased compensation and additional operating expenses related to acquisitions partially offset by a reduction in expenses due to a stronger us dollar 

the nongaap results exclude the income statement effects of the acquisition accounting adjustments to deferred revenue stockbased compensation amortization of acquired intangible assets transaction costs related to business combinations and adjustments related to the transition tax associated with the tax cuts and jobs act for further disclosure regarding nongaap results see the section titled nongaap results immediately preceding the section titled liquidity and capital resources

in constant currency our growth rates were as follows 



constant currency amounts exclude the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on the reported results to present this information the 2019 results for entities whose functional currency is a currency other than the us dollar were converted to us dollars at rates that were in effect for the 2018 comparable period rather than the actual exchange rates in effect for 2019  constant currency growth rates are calculated by adjusting the 2019 reported revenue and operating income amounts by the 2019 currency fluctuation impacts and comparing to the 2018 comparable period reported revenue and operating income amounts

revenue 



our revenue in the year ended december 31 2019 increased 172  as compared to the year ended december 31 2018  or 190 in constant currency the growth rate was favorably impacted by our continued investments in our global sales support and marketing organizations as well as our 2019 and 2018 acquisitions which contributed incremental revenue of 729 million lease license revenue increased 473  or 494 in constant currency as compared to the year ended december 31 2018  driven primarily by an increase in multiyear lease contracts annual maintenance contracts that were sold with new perpetual licenses maintenance contracts for new perpetual licenses sold in previous years and the maintenance portion of lease license contracts each contributed to maintenance revenue growth of 124  or 143 in constant currency service revenue driven primarily by a focus on service offerings that provide onsite mentorship on simulation best practices training and expanding simulation adoption increased 391  or 415 in constant currency as compared to the year ended december 31 2018  perpetual license revenue which is derived primarily from new sales during the year ended december 31 2019  decreased 25  or 11 in constant currency as compared to the year ended december 31 2018  

we continue to experience increased interest by some of our larger customers in enterprise agreements that often include longerterm timebased licenses involving a larger number of our software products while these arrangements typically involve a higher overall transaction price the upfront recognition of license revenue related to these larger multiyear transactions can result in significantly higher lease license revenue and corresponding revenue growth volatility as software products across a large variety of applications and industries become increasingly distributed in softwareasaservice cloud and other subscription environments in which the licensing approach is timebased rather than perpetual we are also experiencing a shifting preference from perpetual licenses to timebased licenses across a broader spectrum of our customers 

with respect to revenue on average for the year ended december 31 2019  the us dollar was approximately 33 stronger  when measured against our primary foreign currencies than for the year ended december 31 2018  the table below presents the impacts of currency fluctuations on revenue for the year ended december 31 2019  amounts in brackets indicate an adverse impact from currency fluctuations 



the net overall stronger us dollar also resulted in decreased operating income of 102 million for the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31 2018  

as a percentage of revenue our international and domestic revenues and our direct and indirect revenues were as follows 



in valuing deferred revenue on the balance sheets of our recent acquisitions as of their respective acquisition dates we applied the fair value provisions applicable to the accounting for business combinations resulting in a reduction of deferred revenue as compared to the historical carrying amount as a result our postacquisition revenue will be less than the sum of what would have otherwise been reported by us and each acquiree absent the acquisitions the impacts on reported revenue were 125 million and 94 million for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively the expected impacts on reported revenue are 39 million and 80 million for the quarter ending march 31 2020 and the year ending december 31 2020  respectively

software licenses the increase in the cost of software licenses was primarily due to increased thirdparty royalties of 56 million 

amortization the net decrease in amortization expense was primarily due to a decrease in the amortization of trade names and acquired technology due to assets that became fully amortized which was partially offset by the amortization of newly acquired intangible assets 

maintenance and service the net increase in maintenance and service costs was primarily due to the following 

 the improvement in gross profit was a result of the increase in revenue partially offset by the increase in the related cost of sales

interest income interest income for the year ended december 31 2019 was 128 million as compared to 114 million for the year ended december 31 2018  interest income increased as a result of an increase in the average rate of return on invested cash balances 

interest expense interest expense for the year ended december 31 2019 was 35 million as compared to 01 million for the year ended december 31 2018  interest expense increased as a result of the interest incurred on debt financing obtained in fiscal year 2019 

other expense net our other expense consisted of the following 

income tax provision our income before income tax provision income tax provision and effective tax rate were as follows 



the decrease in the effective tax rate from the prior year was primarily due to 67 million of benefit related to the release of valuation allowance in a foreign jurisdiction and 18 million of benefit related to transition tax recorded in 2019 these benefits are offset by 67 million of benefit recorded in 2018 related to global legal entity restructuring activities that did not recur in 2019 

when compared to the federal and state combined statutory rate for each respective period the effective tax rates for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 were favorably impacted by tax benefits from stockbased compensation the foreignderived intangible income deduction and research and development credits

other expense net our other expense net consists of the following 



income tax provision our income before income tax provision income tax provision and effective tax rate were as follows 



on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act tax reform tax reform made broad and complex changes to the us tax code including but not limited to 1 reducing the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent  2 requiring companies to pay a onetime federal income tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries transition tax 3 generally eliminating us federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries 4 creating a new provision designed to tax global intangible lowtaxed income gilti which allows for the possibility of using foreign tax credits ftcs and a deduction of up to 50 percent to offset the income tax liability subject to some limitations 5 repealing the domestic production activity deduction 6 creating the foreignderived intangible income deduction 7 creating the base erosion antiabuse tax a new minimum tax 8 allowing for full expensing of qualified property through bonus depreciation and 9 creating limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation 

the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin sab 118 which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of tax reform sab 118 provided a measurement period that was limited to one year from enactment for companies to complete the accounting under asc 740 income taxes  in accordance with sab 118 throughout the measurement period a company must reflect the income tax effects of those aspects of tax reform for which the accounting under asc 740 was complete in the financial statements to the extent that a company’s accounting for certain income tax effects of tax reform was incomplete but a reasonable estimate was able to be made the company must record a provisional estimate in the financial statements if a company could not determine a provisional estimate to be included in the financial statements it should continue to apply asc 740 on the basis of the tax laws that were in effect immediately before the enactment of tax reform 

as further discussed below we finalized our provisional tax reform calculations as of the end of the measurement period based on guidance and information available as of the reporting date the us government has not yet issued final guidance related to a portion of the new rules enacted as part of tax reform subsequent adjustments if any will be recorded in the period in which guidance is finalized 

our accounting for the impact of the reduction in the us federal corporate tax rate on our deferred tax assets and liabilities is complete tax reform reduced the corporate tax rate to 21 percent  effective january 1 2018 consequently we recorded a net adjustment to deferred income tax expense of 19 million for the year ended december 31 2017 to revalue our deferred tax assets and liabilities no further adjustments were recorded for the year ended december 31 2018 

our accounting for the transition tax is complete reasonable estimates of certain effects were calculated and a provisional adjustment of 160 million was recorded in the december 31 2017 financial statements to determine the amount of the transition tax we determined in addition to other factors the amount of post1986 earnings and profits ep of the relevant subsidiaries as well as the amount of nonus income taxes paid on such earnings based on revised ep calculations updated during the measurement period we recognized an additional measurementperiod adjustment for the year ended december 31 2018 of 09 million to the transition tax obligation and a corresponding adjustment to tax expense 

our accounting for the indefinite reinvestment assertion is complete in general it is our intention to permanently reinvest all earnings in excess of previously taxed amounts as part of tax reform substantially all of the previous earnings of our nonus subsidiaries were taxed through the transition tax and current earnings are taxed as part of gilti tax expense these taxes increased our previously taxed earnings and allow for the repatriation of the majority of our foreign earnings without any residual us federal tax during the year ended december 31 2018 we repatriated 1443 million of foreign cash we did not make any adjustments related to our indefinite reinvestment assertion during the year ended december 31 2018 

our accounting policy choice for gilti is complete under us gaap we are allowed to make an accounting policy choice of either 1 treating taxes due on future us inclusions in taxable income related to gilti as a currentperiod expense when incurred the period cost method or 2 factoring such amounts into the measurement of our deferred taxes the deferred method we selected the period cost method and recorded gilti tax expense of 04 million in the financial statements for the year ended december 31 2018 

the decrease in the effective tax rate from the prior year was primarily due to the reduction in the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent enacted as part of tax reform the additional 151 million of transition tax in 2017 when compared to 2018 and a net 67 million benefit related to global legal entity restructuring activities the effective tax rate was also reduced by the foreignderived intangible income deduction increased research and development credits and increased stockbased compensation benefits partially offset by the loss of the domestic manufacturing deduction which was repealed as part of tax reform 

when compared to the federal and state combined statutory rate the effective tax rates for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 were favorably impacted by tax benefits from stockbased compensation and research and development credits 

net income our net income diluted earnings per share and weighted average shares used in computing diluted earnings per share were as follows 



nongaap results 

we provide nongaap revenue nongaap operating income nongaap operating profit margin nongaap net income and nongaap diluted earnings per share as supplemental measures to gaap regarding our operational performance these financial measures exclude the impact of certain items and therefore have not been calculated in accordance with gaap a detailed explanation and a reconciliation of each nongaap financial measure to our most comparable gaap financial measure are described below 



 



 nongaap measures 

we use nongaap financial measures a to evaluate our historical and prospective financial performance as well as our performance relative to our competitors b to set internal sales targets and spending budgets c to allocate resources d to measure operational profitability and the accuracy of forecasting e to assess financial discipline over operational expenditures and f as an important factor in determining variable compensation for management and employees in addition many financial analysts that follow us focus on and publish both historical results and future projections based on nongaap financial measures we believe that it is in the best interest of our investors to provide this information to analysts so that they accurately report the nongaap financial information moreover investors have historically requested and we have historically reported these nongaap financial measures as a means of providing consistent and comparable information with past reports of financial results 

while we believe that these nongaap financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors there are limitations associated with the use of these nongaap financial measures these nongaap financial measures are not prepared in accordance with gaap are not reported by all our competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of our competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation we compensate for these limitations by using these nongaap financial measures as supplements to gaap financial measures and by reviewing the reconciliations of the nongaap financial measures to their most comparable gaap financial measures 

the adjustments to these nongaap financial measures and the basis for such adjustments are outlined below 

acquisition accounting for deferred revenue and its related tax impact historically we have consummated acquisitions in order to support our strategic and other business objectives in accordance with the fair value provisions applicable to the accounting for business combinations acquired deferred revenue is often recorded on the opening balance sheet at an amount that is lower than the historical carrying value although this acquisition accounting requirement has no impact on our business or cash flow it adversely impacts our reported gaap revenue in the reporting periods following an acquisition in order to provide investors with financial information that facilitates comparison of both historical and future results we provide nongaap financial measures which exclude the impact of the acquisition accounting adjustment we believe that this nongaap financial adjustment is useful to investors because it allows investors to a evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by us in our financial and operational decisionmaking and b compare our past and future reports of financial results as the revenue reduction related to acquired deferred revenue will not recur when related annual lease licenses and software maintenance contracts are renewed in future periods 

amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions and its related tax impact we incur amortization of intangible assets included in our gaap presentation of amortization expense related to various acquisitions we have made we exclude these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating nongaap operating income nongaap operating profit margin nongaap net income and nongaap diluted earnings per share when we evaluate our continuing operational performance because these costs are fixed at the time of an acquisition are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by us after the acquisition accordingly we do not consider these expenses for purposes of evaluating our performance during the applicable time period after the acquisition and we exclude such expenses when making decisions to allocate resources we believe that these nongaap financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to a evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by us in our financial and operational decisionmaking and b compare our past reports of financial results as we have historically reported these nongaap financial measures 

stockbased compensation expense and its related tax impact  we incur expense related to stockbased compensation included in our gaap presentation of cost of software licenses cost of maintenance and service research and development expense and selling general and administrative expense this nongaap adjustment also includes excess payroll tax expense related to stockbased compensation stockbased compensation expense benefit incurred in connection with our deferred compensation plan held in a rabbi trust includes an offsetting benefit charge recorded in other income expense although stockbased compensation is an expense and viewed as a form of compensation we exclude these expenses for the purpose of calculating nongaap operating income nongaap operating profit margin nongaap net income and nongaap diluted earnings per share when we evaluate our continuing operational performance we similarly exclude income expense related to assets held in a rabbi trust in connection with our deferred compensation plan specifically we exclude stockbased compensation and income expense related to assets held in the deferred compensation plan rabbi trust during our annual budgeting process and our quarterly and annual assessments of our performance the annual budgeting process is the primary mechanism whereby we allocate resources to various initiatives and operational requirements additionally the annual review by our board of directors during which it compares our historical business model and profitability to the planned business model and profitability for the forthcoming year excludes the impact of stockbased compensation in evaluating the performance of our senior management and department managers charges related to stockbased compensation are excluded from expenditure and profitability results in fact we record stockbased compensation expense into a standalone cost center for which no single operational manager is responsible or accountable in this way we can review on a periodtoperiod basis each managers performance and assess financial discipline over operational expenditures without the effect of stockbased compensation we believe that these nongaap financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to a evaluate our operating results and the effectiveness of the methodology used by us to review our operating results and b review historical comparability in our financial reporting as well as comparability with competitors operating results 

restructuring charges and the related tax impact we occasionally incur expenses for restructuring our workforce included in our gaap presentation of cost of software licenses cost of maintenance and service research and development expense and selling general and administrative expense we exclude these expenses for the purpose of calculating nongaap operating income nongaap operating profit margin nongaap net income and nongaap diluted earnings per share when we evaluate our continuing operational performance as we generally do not incur these expenses as a part of our operations we believe that these nongaap financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to a evaluate our operating results and the effectiveness of the methodology used by us to review our operating results and b review historical comparability in our financial reporting as well as comparability with competitors operating results 

transaction costs related to business combinations we incur expenses for professional services rendered in connection with business combinations which are included in our gaap presentation of selling general and administrative expense these expenses are generally not taxdeductible we exclude these acquisitionrelated transaction expenses derived from announced 

acquisitions for the purpose of calculating nongaap operating income nongaap operating profit margin nongaap net income and nongaap diluted earnings per share when we evaluate our continuing operational performance as we generally would not have otherwise incurred these expenses in the periods presented as a part of our operations we believe that these nongaap financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to a evaluate our operating results and the effectiveness of the methodology used by us to review our operating results and b review historical comparability in our financial reporting as well as comparability with competitors operating results 

tax cuts and jobs act we recorded impacts to our income tax provision related to the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act specifically for the transition tax related to unrepatriated cash and the impacts of the tax rate change on net deferred tax assets we exclude these impacts for the purpose of calculating nongaap net income and nongaap diluted earnings per share when we evaluate our continuing operational performance as i the charges are not expected to recur as part of our normal operations and ii the charges resulted from the extremely infrequent event of major us tax reform the last such reform having occurred in 1986 we believe that these nongaap financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to a evaluate our operating results and the effectiveness of the methodology used by us to review our operating results and b review historical comparability in our financial reporting 

nongaap financial measures are not in accordance with or an alternative for gaap our nongaap financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable gaap financial measures and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap 

we have provided a reconciliation of the nongaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures as listed below 



liquidity and capital resources 



cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of highly liquid investments such as money market funds and deposits held at major banks shortterm investments consist primarily of deposits held by certain of our foreign subsidiaries with original maturities of three months to one year the following table presents our foreign and domestic holdings of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments 



in general it is our intention to permanently reinvest all earnings in excess of previously taxed amounts as part of tax reform substantially all of the previous earnings of our nonus subsidiaries were taxed through the transition tax and current earnings are taxed as part of gilti tax expense these taxes increased our previously taxed earnings and allow for the repatriation of the majority of our foreign earnings without any residual us federal tax while we believe that the financial reporting bases may be greater than the tax bases of investments in foreign subsidiaries for any earnings in excess of previously taxed amounts such amounts are considered permanently reinvested the cumulative temporary difference related to such permanently reinvested earnings is approximately 328 million and we would anticipate the tax effect on those earnings to be immaterial as a result of tax reform 

the amount of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments held by foreign subsidiaries is subject to translation adjustments caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period the offset to which is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet 

cash flows from operating activities 



fiscal year 2019 as compared to fiscal year 2018 

net cash provided by operating activities increased during the current fiscal year due to increased net income net of noncash operating adjustments of 1074 million  partially offset by decreased net cash flows from operating assets and liabilities of 924 million  

fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017 

net cash provided by operating activities increased during the prior fiscal year due to increased net income net of noncash operating adjustments of 1514 million partially offset by decreased net cash flows from operating assets and liabilities of 941 million 

cash flows from investing activities 



fiscal year 2019 as compared to fiscal year 2018 

net cash used in investing activities increased during the current fiscal year due primarily to increased acquisitionrelated net cash outlays of 5042 million and increased capital expenditures of 232 million  we currently plan capital spending of 450 million to 550 million during fiscal year 2020 as compared to the 449 million that was spent in fiscal year 2019  the level of spending will depend on various factors including the growth of the business and general economic conditions 

fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017 

net cash used in investing activities increased during the prior fiscal year due primarily to increased acquisitionrelated net cash outlays of 2191 million 

cash flows from financing activities 



fiscal year 2019 as compared to fiscal year 2018 

net cash provided by financing activities increased during the current fiscal year due primarily to 5000 million in proceeds from longterm debt obtained in fiscal year 2019 related to the lst acquisition and decreased stock repurchases of 2107 million  partially offset by increased restricted stock unit withholding taxes paid in lieu of issuing shares of 136 million  

fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017 

net cash used in financing activities decreased during the prior fiscal year due primarily to decreased stock repurchases of 662 million partially offset by increased restricted stock unit withholding taxes paid in lieu of issuing shares of 178 million and decreased proceeds from shares issued for stockbased compensation of 115 million 

other cash flow information 

we believe that existing cash and cash equivalent balances of 8721 million  together with cash generated from operations and access to the 5000 million revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements through the next twelve months our cash requirements in the future may also be financed through additional equity or debt financings there can be no assurance that such financings can be obtained on favorable terms if at all we repaid 750 million of our unsecured term loan in january 2020 prior to its scheduled maturity date 

under our stock repurchase program we repurchased shares as follows 



in february 2018 our board of directors increased the number of shares authorized for repurchase to a total of 50 million shares under the stock repurchase program as of december 31 2019  35 million shares remained available for repurchase under the program 

the authorized repurchase program does not have an expiration date and the pace of the repurchase activity will depend on factors such as working capital needs cash requirements for acquisitions our stock price and economic and market conditions our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases or pursuant to a rule 10b51 plan 

we continue to generate positive cash flows from operating activities and believe that the best uses of our excess cash are to invest in the business acquire or make investments in complementary companies products services and technologies and make payments on our outstanding debt balances any future acquisitions may be funded by available cash and investments cash generated from operations debt financing or the issuance of additional securities additionally we have in the past and expect in the future to repurchase stock in order to both offset dilution and return capital in excess of our requirements to stockholders with the goal of increasing stockholder value 

offbalancesheet arrangements 

we do not have any specialpurpose entities or offbalancesheet arrangements 

contractual obligations 

our significant contractual obligations as of december 31 2019 are summarized below 





critical accounting policies and estimates 

we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition  our revenue is derived principally from the licensing of computer software products and from related maintenance contracts we adopted asc 606 on january 1 2018 using the modified retrospective approach for all contracts not completed as of the date of adoption results for reporting periods beginning after january 1 2018 are presented under asc 606 while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with asc 605 the adoption of asc 606 represents a change in accounting principle that will more closely align revenue recognition with the delivery of our software licenses maintenance and services 

revenue recognition policy 2019 and 2018 asc 606 

we enter into contracts that include combinations of products maintenance and services which are accounted for as separate performance obligations with differing revenue recognition patterns 

revenue from perpetual licenses is classified as software license revenue software license revenue is recognized up front upon delivery of the licensed product andor the utility that enables the customer to access authorization keys provided that an enforceable contract has been received typically our perpetual licenses are sold with postcontract support pcs which includes unspecified technical enhancements and customer support we allocate value in bundled perpetual and pcs arrangements based on the standalone selling prices of the perpetual license and pcs revenue from pcs is classified as maintenance revenue and is recognized ratably over the term of the contract as we satisfy the pcs performance obligation over time 

in addition to perpetual licenses we sell timebased lease licenses lease licenses are sold only as a bundled arrangement that includes the rights to a term software license and pcs utilizing observable inputs we determined that 50 of the estimated standalone selling price of the lease license is attributable to the term license and 50 is attributable to the pcs this determination considered the value relationship for our products between pcs to timebased lease licenses the value relationship between pcs and perpetual licenses the average economic life of our products software renewal rates and the price of the bundled arrangement in relation to the perpetual licensing approach consistent with the perpetual sales the license component is classified as software license revenue and recognized as revenue up front at the commencement of the lease upon delivery of the licensed product andor utility that enables the customer to access authorization keys the pcs is classified as maintenance revenue and is recognized ratably over the term of the contract as we provide the pcs benefit over time 

revenue from training support and other services is recognized as the services are performed for contracts in which the service consists of a single performance obligation such as providing a training class to a customer we recognize revenue upon completion of the performance obligation for service contracts that are longer in duration and often include multiple performance obligations for example both training and consulting we measure the progress toward completion of the obligations and recognize revenue accordingly in measuring progress towards the completion of performance obligations we typically utilize outputbased estimates for services with contractual billing arrangements that are not based on time and materials and estimate output based on the total tasks completed as compared to the total tasks required for each work contract inputbased estimates are utilized for services that involve general consultations with contractual billing arrangements based on time and materials utilizing direct labor as the input measure proceeds from customers for the purpose of expediting roadmap items developing new products or creating specific features and functionality for existing products is classified as revenue 

we also execute arrangements through independent channel partners in which the channel partners are authorized to market and distribute our software products to end users of our products and services in specified territories in sales facilitated by channel partners the channel partner bears the risk of collection from the enduser customer we recognize revenue from transactions with channel partners in a manner consistent with the direct sales described above for both perpetual and timebased licenses revenue from channel partner transactions is the amount remitted to us by the channel partners this amount includes a fee for pcs that is compensation for providing technical enhancements and the second level of technical support to the end user which is recognized over the period that pcs is to be provided 

nonincome related taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as accounts receivable and accrued expenses the collection and payment of these amounts are reported on a net basis in the consolidated statements of income and do not impact reported revenues or expenses 

we do not offer right of return we warrant to our customers that our software will perform substantially as specified in our current user manuals we have not experienced significant claims related to software warranties beyond the scope of 

maintenance support which we are already obligated to provide the warranty is not sold and cannot be purchased separately the warranty does not provide any type of additional service to the customer or performance obligation for us 

our agreements with our customers generally require us to indemnify the customer against claims that our software infringes thirdparty patent copyright trademark or other proprietary rights such indemnification obligations are generally limited in a variety of industrystandard respects including our right to replace an infringing product 

significant judgments asc 606 

our contracts with customers typically include promises to transfer licenses and services to a customer judgment is required to determine if the promises are separate performance obligations and if so to allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation we use the estimated standalone selling price method to allocate the transaction price for each performance obligation the estimated standalone selling price is determined using all information reasonably available to us including market conditions and other observable inputs the corresponding revenues are recognized as the related performance obligations are satisfied 

we apply a practical expedient to expense sales commissions as incurred when the amortization period would have been one year or less sales commissions associated with the initial year of multiyear contracts are expensed as incurred due to their immateriality sales commissions associated with multiyear contracts beyond the initial year are subject to an employee service requirement and are expensed as incurred as they are not considered incremental costs to obtain a contract 

we are required to adjust promised amounts of consideration for the effects of the time value of money if the timing of the payments provides the customer or us with a significant financing benefit we consider various factors in assessing whether a financing component exists including the duration of the contract market interest rates and the timing of payments our contracts do not include a significant financing component requiring adjustment to the transaction price 

revenue recognition policy 2017 asc 605 

revenue from perpetual licenses was classified as license revenue and was recognized upon delivery of the licensed product andor the utility that enabled the customer to access authorization keys provided that acceptance had occurred and a signed contractual obligation was received the price was fixed and determinable and collectibility of the receivable was probable we determined the fair value of pcs sold together with perpetual licenses based on the rate charged for pcs when sold separately revenue from pcs contracts was classified as maintenance and service revenue and was recognized ratably over the term of the contract 

revenue for software lease licenses was classified as license revenue and was recognized over the period of the lease contract typically our software leases include pcs which due to the short term principally one year or less of our software lease licenses were not permitted to be separated from lease revenue for accounting purposes as a result both the lease licenses and pcs were recognized ratably over the lease period we included the revenue for the entire lease arrangement within software license revenue in the consolidated statements of income 

many of our semiconductor products are typically licensed via longer term leases of 24 – 36 months we recognized revenue for these licenses over the term of the lease contract because we did not have vendorspecific objective evidence of the fair value of these leases we also recognized revenue from perpetual licenses over the term of the lease contract during the infrequent occurrence of these licenses being sold with semiconductor leases in multipleelement arrangements 

revenue from training support and other services was recognized as the services were performed we applied the specific performance method to contracts in which the service consisted of a single act such as providing a training class to a customer and the proportional performance method to other service contracts that were longer in duration and often included multiple acts for example both training and consulting in applying the proportional performance method we typically utilized outputbased estimates for services with contractual billing arrangements that were not based on time and materials and estimated output based on the total tasks completed as compared to the total tasks required for each work contract inputbased estimates were utilized for services that involved general consultations with contractual billing arrangements based on time and materials utilizing direct labor as the input measure 

the accounting treatment under asc 605 associated with arrangements through independent channel partners nonincome related taxes warranties and indemnification obligations is consistent with the accounting treatment under asc 606 described above 

goodwill and other intangible assets  we test goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment at least annually by performing a quantitative assessment of whether the fair value of each reporting unit or asset exceeds its carrying amount we have one reporting unit goodwill is tested at this reporting unit level and indefinitelived intangible assets are tested at the individual asset level this requires us to assess and make judgments regarding a variety of factors which impact the fair value 

of the reporting unit or asset being tested including business plans anticipated future cash flows economic projections and other market data because there are inherent uncertainties involved in these factors significant differences between these estimates and actual results could result in future impairment charges and could materially impact our future financial results during the first quarter of 2019  we completed the annual impairment test for goodwill and the indefinitelived intangible asset and determined that these assets had not been impaired as of the test date january 1 2019  no other events or circumstances changed during the year ended december 31 2019 that would indicate that the fair values of our reporting unit and indefinitelived intangible asset are below their carrying values 

intangible assets are recognized apart from goodwill whenever an acquired intangible asset arises from contractual or other legal rights or whenever it is capable of being separated or divided from the acquired entity and sold transferred licensed rented or exchanged either individually or in combination with a related contract asset or liability we determined the fair value of our intangible assets using various valuation techniques including the relieffromroyalty method and the multiperiod excess earnings method these models utilize certain unobservable inputs classified as level 3 measurements as defined by asc 820 fair value measurements and disclosures  the determination of fair value requires considerable judgment and is sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions estimates and market factors estimating fair value requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans as well as industry and economic conditions these assumptions and estimates include but are not limited to royalty rate discount rate and attrition rate the fair values of the intangible assets will be amortized over their useful lives impairment losses are recognized if the carrying amounts of finitelived intangible assets are both not recoverable and exceed the fair values 

income taxes  we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period of the enactment date 

we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized in making such determination we consider all available positive and negative evidence including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and recent financial operations in the event we determine that we will be able to realize deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance was used to reduce their carrying value the adjustment to the valuation allowance will be recorded as a reduction to the provision for income taxes 

tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a morelikelythannot threshold otherwise these tax benefits are recorded when a tax position has been effectively settled which means that the statute of limitations has expired or the appropriate taxing authority has completed its examination even though the statute of limitations remains open 

we recognize interest and penalties related to income taxes within the income tax expense line in the consolidated statements of income accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheets 

stockbased compensation  we grant restricted stock units and other stock awards to employees and directors under our equity incentive plan eligible employees can also purchase shares of our common stock at a discount under our employee stock purchase plan the benefits provided under these plans are stockbased payments subject to the provisions of stockbased payment accounting guidance we use the fair value method to apply the provisions of stockbased payment accounting guidance stockbased compensation expense for 2019  2018 and 2017 was 1162 million  833 million and 532 million  respectively as of december 31 2019  total unrecognized estimated compensation expense related to awards granted prior to that date was 1864 million which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 15 years 

prior to 2017 we granted stock option awards the value of each stock option award was estimated on the date of grant or date of acquisition for options issued in a business combination using the blackscholes option pricing model blackscholes model the determination of the fair value of stockbased payment awards using an option pricing model was affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables these variables included our stock volatility during the preceding six years actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors interest rate assumptions using the fiveyear us treasury note yield on the date of grant or acquisition date and expected dividends the stockbased compensation expense for options is recorded ratably over the requisite service period 

we issue various restricted stock unit awards which contain either a market condition a performance condition a service condition or certain combinations of the three restricted stock unit awards are valued based on the grantdate fair value of the award stockbased compensation expense is recognized over the employees requisite service period for awards with only a service condition for awards with a performance condition stockbased compensation expense is recorded from the service 

inception date through the conclusion of the measurement period based on managements estimates concerning the probability of vesting 

vesting of restricted stock unit awards with a market condition is based on our performance as measured by total stockholder return relative to the appreciation of a specified stock index over the measurement period subject to each participants continued employment through the conclusion of the measurement period the fair value of the restricted stock unit awards with a market condition is estimated using a monte carlo simulation model the determination of the fair value of the awards is affected by the grant date and several variables each of which has been identified in the chart below stockbased compensation expense based on the fair value of the award is recorded from the grant date through the conclusion of the measurement period 



we also grant restricted stock units to nonemployee directors which vest upon the earlier of one year from the date of grant or the date of the next regular annual meeting of stockholders if a nonemployee director retires prior to the vest date the nonemployee director receives a prorata portion of the restricted stock units 

to the extent we change the terms of our stockbased compensation programs experience market volatility in the pricing of our common stock that increases the implied volatility assumption used in the pricing models refine different assumptions or assume stock awards from acquired companies that are different in nature than our stock award arrangements among other potential impacts the stockbased compensation expense recorded in future periods and the related tax benefits may differ significantly from what was recorded in previous reporting periods forfeitures of awards are accounted for as they occur 

estimates of stockbased compensation expense are significant to our financial statements but this expense is partially based on the aforementioned option valuation and monte carlo simulation models and will never result in the payment of cash by us other than through the payment of withholding taxes in lieu of additional share issuance for this reason and because we do not view stockbased compensation as related to our operational performance the board of directors and management exclude stockbased compensation expense when evaluating our underlying business performance 

contingencies  we are involved in various investigations claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business including commercial disputes labor and employment matters tax audits alleged infringement of intellectual property rights and other matters we review the status of these matters assess our financial exposure and record a related accrual if the potential loss from an investigation claim or legal proceeding is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable significant judgment is involved in the determination of probability and in the determination of whether an exposure is reasonably estimable as a result of the uncertainties involved in making these estimates we may have to revise our estimates as facts and circumstances change the revision of these estimates could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend interest rate risk  changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest income that is generated from our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments and the interest expense that is generated from our outstanding borrowings for the year ended december 31 2019  interest income was 128 million and interest expense was 35 million  cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of highly liquid investments such as money market funds and deposits held at major banks shortterm investments consist primarily of deposits held by certain foreign subsidiaries with original maturities of three months to one year 

foreign currency transaction risk as we operate in international regions a portion of our revenue expenses cash accounts receivable and payment obligations are denominated in foreign currencies as a result changes in currency exchange rates will affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows we are most impacted by movements in and among the british pound euro japanese yen south korean won and us dollar 

with respect to revenue on average for the year ended december 31 2019  the us dollar was approximately 33 stronger  when measured against our primary foreign currencies than for the year ended december 31 2018  the table below presents the impacts of currency fluctuations on revenue for the year ended december 31 2019  amounts in brackets indicate a net adverse impact from currency fluctuations 



the net overall stronger us dollar also resulted in decreased operating income of 102 million for the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31 2018  

the most significant currency impacts on revenue and operating income are typically attributable to us dollar exchange rate changes against the british pound euro japanese yen and south korean won historical exchange rates for these currency pairs are reflected in the charts below

competition 

the company believes that the principal factors affecting sales of its software include ease of use breadth and depth of functionality flexibility quality ease of integration with other software systems file compatibility across computer platforms range of supported computer platforms performance price and total cost of ownership customer service and support company reputation and financial viability and effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts 

the company continues to experience competition across all markets for its products and services the companys competitors include large global publicly traded companies small geographicallyfocused firms startup firms and solutions produced inhouse by the end users some of the companys current and possible future competitors have greater financial technical marketing and other resources than the company and some have wellestablished relationships with current and potential customers of the company the companys current and possible future competitors also include firms that have elected or may in the future elect to compete by means of open source licensing these competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes price reductions andor increased operating costs and could result in lower revenues margins and net income 

proprietary rights and licenses 

the company regards its software as proprietary and relies on a combination of trade secret copyright patent and trademark laws license agreements nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect its proprietary rights in its products the company distributes its software products under software license agreements that grant customers nonexclusive licenses which are typically nontransferable for the use of the companys products license agreements for the companys products are directly between the company and end users use of the licensed software product is restricted to specified sites unless the customer obtains a multisite license for its use of the software product or the software product is by its nature a multisite use product software security measures are also employed to prevent unauthorized use of the companys software products and the licensed software is subject to terms and conditions prohibiting unauthorized reproduction for most products customers may purchase a perpetual license of the technology with the right to annually purchase ongoing maintenance technical support and upgrades or may lease the product on a fixedterm basis for a fee that includes the license maintenance technical support and upgrades for its discovery products customers purchase an annual subscription for a certain number of named users that includes the license maintenance technical support and upgrades 

the company licenses its software products utilizing a combination of webbased and hardcopy license terms and forms for certain software products the company primarily relies on clickwrapped licenses ie online agreements where the website provider posts terms and conditions and the user clicks on the accept button the enforceability of these types of agreements under the laws of some jurisdictions is uncertain 

the company also seeks to protect the source code of its software as a trade secret and as unpublished copyrighted work the company has obtained federal trademark registration protection for ansys and other marks in the us and foreign countries additionally the company was awarded numerous patents by the us patent and trademark office and has a number of patent applications pending to the extent the company does not choose to seek patent protection for its intellectual property the company primarily relies on the protection of its source code as a trade secret 

employees of the company have signed agreements under which they have agreed not to disclose trade secrets or confidential information these agreements where legally permitted restrict engagement in or connection with any business that is competitive with the company anywhere in the world while employed by the company and in some cases for specified periods thereafter and state that any products or technology created by employees during their term of employment are the property of the company in addition the company requires all channel partners to enter into agreements not to disclose the companys trade secrets and other proprietary information 

despite these precautions there can be no assurance that misappropriation of the companys technology and proprietary information including source code will be prevented further there can be no assurance that copyright trademark patent and trade secret protection will be available for the companys products in certain jurisdictions or that restrictions on the ability of employees and channel partners to engage in activities competitive with the company will be enforceable costly and timeconsuming litigation could be necessary in the future to enforce the companys rights to its trade secrets and proprietary information or to enforce its patent rights and copyrights and it is possible that in the future the companys competitors may be able to obtain the companys trade secrets or to independently develop similar unpatented technology 

the software development industry is characterized by rapid technological change therefore the company believes that factors such as the technological and creative skills of its personnel new product developments frequent product enhancements name recognition and reliable product maintenance are also important to establishing and maintaining technology leadership in addition to the various legal protections of its technology that may be available 

the company does not believe that any of its products infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties there can be no assurance however that third parties will not claim such infringement by the company or its licensors or licensees with respect to current or future products the company expects that software suppliers will increasingly be subject to the risk of such claims as the number of products and suppliers continues to expand and the functionality of products continues to increase any such claims with or without merit could be time consuming result in costly litigation cause product release delays or require the company to enter into royalty or licensing agreements such royalty or licensing agreements if required may not be available on terms acceptable to the company 

seasonal variations

risk factors 

tableend information provided by the company or its spokespersons including information contained in this annual report on form 10k may from time to time contain forwardlooking statements concerning projected financial performance market and industry sector growth product development and commercialization or other aspects of future operations such statements will be based on the assumptions and expectations of the companys management at the time such statements are made the company cautions investors that its performance and therefore any forwardlooking statement is subject to risks and uncertainties various important factors including but not limited to the following may cause the companys future results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statement 

global economic conditions   the companys operations and performance depend significantly on foreign and domestic economic conditions uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment as well as geopolitical conditions can result in significant volatility in credit equity and foreign exchange markets this volatility and the related economic conditions may negatively impact the company as customers defer spending in response to tighter credit higher unemployment geopolitical tensions and uncertainties unpredictable government trade tax or other policies evolving immigration and other labor policies financial market volatility government austerity programs negative financial news declining valuations of investments and other factors in addition certain of the companys customers budgets may be constrained and may be unable to purchase the companys products at the same level as they have in prior periods customer spending levels may be impacted by trade or tax policies or decreased government spending in certain countries as concerns continue regarding economic conditions and government debt levels these economic conditions can change abruptly to the extent the global economy experiences volatility the company may be exposed to impairments of certain assets as their values deteriorate 

tighter credit due to economic conditions may diminish the companys future borrowing ability the companys customers ability to pay for the companys products and services may also be impaired which may lead to an increase in the companys allowance for doubtful accounts and writeoffs of accounts receivable since the company is exposed to the majority of major world markets uncertainty in any significant market may negatively impact the companys performance and results particularly with respect to the companys largest geographic customer bases the company is unable to predict the likely duration and magnitude of changing economic conditions or the likelihood of additional uncertainty arising in any of the companys key markets 

decline in customers businesses   the companys sales are based significantly on enduser demand for products in key industrial sectors many of these sectors periodically experience economic declines which may be exacerbated by other economic factors these factors may also adversely affect the companys business by extending sales cycles and reducing revenue these economic factors may cause the companys customers to reduce the size of their workforce or cut back on operations and may lead to a reduction in renewals of licenses or maintenance contracts with the company the companys customers may request discounts which may cause fluctuations in the companys future operating results the company may not be able to adjust its operating expenses to offset such fluctuations because a substantial portion of the companys operating expenses are related to personnel facilities and marketing programs the level of personnel and related expenses may not be able to be adjusted quickly and is based in significant part on the companys expectation for future revenue 

risks associated with international activities a majority of the companys business comes from outside the united states and the company has customers that supply a wide spectrum of goods and services in virtually all of the worlds major economic regions if any of the foreign economies in which the company does business deteriorate or suffer periods of uncertainty the companys business and performance may be negatively impacted through reduced customer spending changes in purchasing cycles or timing reduced access to credit for its customers or other factors impacting the companys international sales and collections the companys results may also be negatively impacted by geopolitical tensions which may result in increased economic volatility 

as a result of its significant international presence the company has revenue expenses cash accounts receivable and payment obligations denominated in foreign currencies as a result the company is subject to currency exchange risk the companys revenues and operating results are adversely affected when the us dollar strengthens relative to other currencies and are positively affected when the us dollar weakens as a result changes in currency exchange rates will affect the companys financial position results of operations and cash flows in the event that there are economic declines in countries in which the company conducts transactions the resulting changes in currency exchange rates may affect the companys financial position results of operations and cash flows the company seeks to reduce currency exchange transaction risks primarily through its normal operating and treasury activities but there can be no assurance that it will be successful in reducing these risks 

additional risks inherent in the companys international business activities include imposition of government controls export license requirements restrictions on the export of critical technology products and services the violation of anticorruption laws and regulations applicable to the company by third parties in countries where such conduct may be permissible or commonplace political and economic instability difficulties in staffing and managing international operations changes in data privacy regulations longer accounts receivable payment cycles burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws taxes and regulations protectionist economic policies new foreign tariffs and trade sanctions new us export andor import and doingbusiness regulations including new trade sanctions impacting more foreign entities thereby restricting the sale of the companys products and services to those entities which may result in an advantage to certain of the companys competitors who may not be subject to the same regulatory restrictions and the fact that patent copyright trademark and trade secret protection may not be available in every foreign country in which the company sells its products and services the companys business financial position results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks 

the us government has been requesting foreign governments to renegotiate existing trade agreements with the us and to change currency conversion rates increasing uncertainty levels in the international trade environment while preliminary agreements were reached with mexico and canada a high level of uncertainty remains in the future trade conditions including with china which may have an impact on the companys business 

in 2017 the united kingdom initiated a twoyear process to leave the european union commonly known as “brexit” the lack of success of the efforts of the government of the united kingdom to conclude a withdrawal agreement with the representatives of the european union creates a high level of uncertainty in the political legal and economic environment in the united kingdom the european union and the united states the company has significant operations in the united kingdom and the european union ongoing uncertainty or the conclusion of withdrawal terms that are disadvantageous for the company could negatively impact the company’s results 

in may 2018 the general data protection regulation gdpr went into effect in the european union these rules outline a comprehensive set of requirements for businesses that use any personal data inscope for the regulation including the use of data solely for sales marketing or support purposes and with respect to employee data originating in or processed within the european economic area the company is subject to the requirements of the gdpr with respect to both customer and employee data for which noncompliance can result in potentially significant monetary penalties and enhanced regulatory oversight of data practices as well as the basis for a private right of action and class action claims if the company fails to comply with the gdpr or a number of other data protection regulations that apply to the company’s business globally its reputation may suffer and its financial position results of operations and cash flows may be negatively impacted 

sales forecasts  the company makes many operational and strategic decisions based upon short and longterm sales forecasts the companys sales personnel continually monitor the status of all proposals including the estimated closing date and the value of the sale in order to forecast quarterly sales these forecasts are subject to significant estimation and are impacted by many external factors including global economic conditions and the performance of the companys customers a variation in actual sales activity from that forecasted could cause the company to plan or budget incorrectly and therefore could adversely affect the companys business financial position results of operations and cash flows the companys management team forecasts macroeconomic trends and developments and integrates them through longrange planning into budgets research and development strategies and a wide variety of general management duties global economic conditions and the effect those conditions and other disruptions in global markets have on the companys customers may have a significant impact on the accuracy of the companys sales forecasts these conditions may increase the likelihood or the magnitude of variations between actual sales activity and the companys sales forecasts and as a result the companys performance may be hindered because of a failure to properly match corporate strategy with economic conditions this in turn may adversely affect the companys business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

stock market and stock price volatility  market prices for securities of software companies have generally been volatile in particular the market price of the companys common stock has been and may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations as a result of factors affecting the company the software industry or the securities markets in general such factors include but are not limited to declines in trading price that may be triggered by the companys failure to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors moreover the trading price could be subject to additional fluctuations in response to quartertoquarter variations in the companys operating results material announcements made by the company or its competitors conditions in the financial markets or the software industry generally or other events and factors many of which are beyond the companys control 

rapidly changing technology new products risk of product errors the company operates in an industry generally characterized by rapidly changing technology and frequent new product introductions which can render existing products obsolete or unmarketable a major factor in the companys future success will be its ability to anticipate technological changes and to develop and introduce in a timely manner enhancements to its existing products products acquired in acquisitions and new products to meet those changes if the company is unable to introduce new products and to respond quickly to industry changes its business financial position results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

the introduction and marketing of new or enhanced products requires the company to manage the transition from existing products in order to minimize disruption in customer purchasing patterns there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing and marketing on a timely basis new products or product enhancements that the new products will adequately address the changing needs of the marketplace or that the company will successfully manage the transition from existing products software products as complex as those offered by the company may contain undetected errors when first introduced or as new versions are released and the likelihood of errors is increased as a result of the companys commitment to the frequency of its product releases there can be no assurance that errors will not be found in any new or enhanced products after the commencement of commercial shipments certain products require a higher level of sales and support expertise failure of the companys sales channel particularly the indirect channel to obtain this expertise and to sell the new 

product offerings effectively could have an adverse impact on the companys sales in future periods any of these problems may result in the loss of or delay in customer acceptance diversion of development resources damage to the companys reputation or increased service and warranty costs any of which could have a material adverse effect on the companys business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

product quality the company has separate quality systems and registrations under the iso 90012015 standard in addition to other governmental and industrial regulations the companys continued compliance with quality standards and favorable outcomes in periodic examinations is important to retain current customers and vital to procure new sales if the company was determined not to be compliant with various regulatory or iso 9001 standards its certificates of registration could be suspended requiring remedial action and a timeconsuming reregistration process product quality issues or failures could result in the companys reputation becoming diminished resulting in a material adverse impact on revenue operating margins net income financial position and cash flows 

competition  the company continues to experience competition across all markets for its products and services some of the companys current and possible future competitors have greater financial technical marketing and other resources than the company and some have wellestablished relationships with current and potential customers of the company the companys current and possible future competitors also include firms that have competed or may in the future elect to compete by means of open source licensing parties among the companys current or future strategic alliances may diminish or sever technical software development and marketing relationships with the company for competitive purposes these competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes price reductions andor increased operating costs and could result in lower revenues margins and net income 

research and development  the company devotes substantial resources to research and development new competitors technological advances in the software development industry by the company or by competitors acquisitions entry into new markets or other competitive factors may require the company to invest significantly greater resources than it anticipates if the company is required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated without a corresponding increase in revenue its operating results could decline in addition the companys periodic research and development expenses may be independent of its level of revenue which could negatively impact its financial results finally there can be no guarantee that the companys research and development investments will result in products that create additional revenue 

changes in the companys pricing models the intense competition the company faces in the sales of its products and services and general economic and business conditions can put pressure on the company to adjust its prices if the companys competitors offer deep discounts on certain products or services or develop products that the marketplace considers more valuable the company may need to lower prices or offer discounts or other favorable terms in order to compete successfully any such changes may reduce operating margins and could adversely affect operating results the companys maintenance products which include software license updates and product support fees are generally priced as a percentage of its new software license fees the companys competitors may offer lower percentage pricing on product updates and support that could put pressure on the company to further discount its new license or product support prices 

any broadbased change to the companys prices and pricing policies could cause new software license and service revenues to decline or be delayed as its sales force implements and its customers adjust to the new pricing policies some of the companys competitors may bundle software products for promotional purposes or as a longterm pricing strategy or provide guarantees of prices product implementations or wider geographical license usage provisions these practices could over time significantly constrain the prices that the company can charge for certain products if the company does not adapt its pricing models to reflect changes in customer use of its products or changes in customer demand the companys new software license revenues could decrease additionally increased distribution of applications through application service providers including softwareasaservice providers may reduce the average price for the companys products or adversely affect other sales of the companys products reducing new software license revenues unless the company can offset price reductions with volume increases the increase in open source software distribution may also cause the company to adjust its pricing models 

dependence on senior management and key technical personnel  the companys success depends upon the continued services of the companys senior executives key technical employees and other employees each of the companys executive officers key technical personnel and other employees could terminate his or her relationship with the company at any time the loss of any of the companys senior executives might significantly delay or prevent the achievement of the companys business objectives and could materially harm the companys business and customer relationships 

in addition because of the highly technical nature of the companys products the company must attract and retain highly skilled engineering and development personnel many of whom are recruited from outside of the united states the market for this talent is highly competitive the company is limited in its ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws if the immigration laws become stricter or the processing of immigration requests becomes more 

cumbersome or less efficient or if the company has less success in recruiting and retaining key personnel the companys business reputation and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 

dependence on proprietary technology  the companys success is highly dependent upon its proprietary technology the company generally relies on contracts and the laws of copyrights patents trademarks and trade secrets to protect its technology the company maintains a trade secrets program enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees and channel partners and limits access to and distribution of its software documentation and other proprietary information there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company to protect its proprietary technology will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of its technology by third parties or that third parties will not be able to develop similar technology independently costly and timeconsuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of trade secret rights and related confidentiality and nondisclosure provisions although the company is not aware that any of its technology infringes upon the rights of third parties there can be no assurance that other parties will not assert technology infringement claims against the company or that if asserted such claims will not prevail any such litigation could be costly to the company damage its reputation and distract the company’s employees from their daily work any successful infringement claims asserted against the company could require the company to develop technology workarounds for the impacted products or product development which could be costly disrupt product development and delay gotomarket activities such disruption and delay could negatively impact the company’s results 

risks associated with security of the companys products source code and it systems the company makes significant efforts to maintain and improve the security and integrity of its products source code computer systems and data despite significant efforts to create security barriers to such programs it is virtually impossible for the company to entirely mitigate all risks there appears to be an increasing number of computer “hackers” developing and deploying a variety of destructive software programs such as viruses worms ransomware and the like that could attack the companys products and computer systems effective security requires increasingly broad governance that may require involvement of increased numbers of personnel or departments as a result the company may incur costs to increase personnel and technology to prevent such attacks and implement such broader governance because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to networks or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target the company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures like all software products the companys communications system and software is vulnerable to such attacks the impact of such an attack could disrupt the proper functioning of the companys software products cause errors in the output of its customers work allow unauthorized access to sensitive proprietary or confidential information of the company or its customers and employees and result in other destructive outcomes if this were to occur the companys reputation may suffer customers may stop buying products the company could face lawsuits and potential liability and the companys financial performance could be negatively impacted 

there is also a danger of industrial espionage cyberattacks misuse theft of information or assets including source code or damage to assets by people who have gained unauthorized access to the companys facilities systems or information this includes phishing which has become a very prevalent technique such cybersecurity breaches misuse or other disruptions could lead to the disclosure of portions of the companys product source code or other confidential information improper usage and distribution of the companys products without compensation illegal usage of the companys products which could jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through its computer systems and theft manipulation and destruction of private and proprietary data resulting in defective products and production downtimes although the company actively employs measures to combat unlicensed copying access and use of software and intellectual property through a variety of techniques preventing unauthorized use or infringement of the companys rights is inherently difficult these events could adversely affect the companys financial results or could result in significant claims for damages against it participating in lawsuits to protect against any such unauthorized access to usage of or disclosure of any of the companys products or any portion of the companys product source code or in prosecutions in connection with any such cybersecurity breach could be costly and timeconsuming and may divert managements attention and adversely affect the markets perception of the company and its products 

policing the unauthorized distribution and use of the companys products is difficult and software piracy including online piracy is a persistent problem the proliferation of technology designed to circumvent typical software protection measures used in the companys products and the possibility of methods that circumvent the techniques it employs in its products may lead to an expansion in piracy or misuse of its products and intellectual property as a result and despite the companys efforts to prevent such activities the company may nonetheless lose significant revenue due to illegal use of its software and managements attention may be diverted to address specific instances of piracy or misuse or to address piracy and misuse in general 

a number of the companys core processes such as software development sales and marketing customer service and financial transactions rely on its it infrastructure and applications the company also relies upon thirdparty products which are exposed to various security vulnerabilities malicious software sabotage and other cybersecurity breaches of the types 

discussed above could cause an outage of the companys infrastructure which could lead to a substantial denial of service and ultimately to production downtime recovery costs and customer claims this could have a significant negative impact on the companys business financial position profit and cash flows 

the company has implemented a number of measures designed to ensure the security of its information it resources and other assets nonetheless unauthorized users could gain access to its systems through cyberattacks and steal use without authorization and sabotage the companys intellectual property and confidential data any breach of its it security misuse or theft could lead to loss of production recovery costs or litigation brought by employees customers or business partners which could have a significant negative impact on the companys business financial position profit cash flows and reputation 

implementation of it systems  the company is currently implementing a new customer relationship management crm system while this system is anticipated to simplify the sales and order processing efforts and to enhance customer service there is a risk that the project will not achieve the anticipated benefits or that the benefits will not be achieved as quickly as anticipated there is also a risk that the company will have to write off previously capitalized expenditures if the project is not successful or if implementation decisions regarding the project are modified the project implementation timeline and scope may change and become longer and broader as new facets of the design and implementation efforts are undertaken this may take the attention of key operational management away from other aspects of the business including the integration of acquisitions and also result in increased consulting and software costs these factors may have a significant negative impact on the companys business financial position profit cash flows and reputation 

dependence on channel partners  the company continues to distribute a meaningful portion of its products through its global network of independent regional channel partners the channel partners sell the companys software products to new and existing customers expand installations within the existing customer base offer consulting services and provide the first line of technical support consequently in certain geographies the company is highly dependent upon the efforts of the channel partners difficulties in ongoing relationships with channel partners such as failure to meet performance criteria or to promote the companys products as aggressively as the company expects and differences in the handling of customer relationships could adversely affect the companys performance additionally the loss of any major channel partner for any reason including a channel partners decision to sell competing products rather than the companys products could have a material adverse effect on the company moreover the companys future success will depend substantially on the ability and willingness of its channel partners to continue to dedicate the resources necessary to promote the companys portfolio of products and to support a larger installed base of the companys products if the channel partners are unable or unwilling to do so the company may be unable to sustain revenue growth 

the company has been increasing its number of channel partners particularly in international locations the business relationships with these channel partners are recently established and could result in additional compliance burdens for the company these partners also have a lessestablished payment history with the company and revenue from these partners could come with a higher rate of bad debt expense 

during times of significant fluctuations in world currencies certain channel partners may have solvency issues to the extent that effective hedge strategies are not employed or there is not sufficient working capital in particular if the us dollar strengthens relative to other currencies certain channel partners who pay the company in us dollars may have trouble paying the company on time or may have trouble distributing the companys products due to the impact of the currency exchange fluctuation on such channel partners cash flows this may impact the companys ability to distribute its products into certain regions and markets and may have an adverse effect on the companys results of operations and cash flows 

revenue volatility  as described in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k the company adopted asc 606 effective january 1 2018 which significantly impacts the companys timing allocation and presentation of lease license perpetual license and maintenance revenue under previous revenue guidance the company historically maintained stable recurring revenue from the sale of software lease licenses and software maintenance subscriptions however under asc 606 the license component of lease revenue is recognized up front whereas it was recognized ratably over the contract under prior guidance the postcontract support portion of lease license contracts continues to be recognized over the contract term but it is now allocated to maintenance and service revenue 

the company continues to sell perpetual licenses that involve the payment of a single upfront fee historically these licenses have been more typical in the computer software industry and remain as the preferred licensing approach in certain markets the revenue associated with perpetual licenses continues to be recognized up front consistent with prior revenue guidance 

the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance coupled with the companys continued sales of perpetual licenses creates the likelihood for software license revenue volatility to increase across periods particularly as compared to the companys results under the previous revenue recognition standard the companys revenue in any period will depend significantly on sales contracts completed during that period 

renewal rates for annual lease and maintenance contracts a substantial portion of the companys license and maintenance revenue is derived from annual lease and maintenance contracts these contracts are generally renewed on an annual basis and typically have a high rate of customer renewal in addition to the recurring revenue base associated with these contracts a majority of customers purchasing new perpetual licenses also purchase related annual maintenance contracts if the rate of renewal for these contracts is adversely affected by economic or other factors the companys lease license and maintenance growth will be adversely affected as a result the companys business financial position results of operations and cash flows may also be adversely impacted during those periods 

risks associated with acquisitions historically the company has consummated acquisitions in order to support the companys longterm strategic direction accelerate innovation provide increased capabilities to existing products supply new products and services expand its customer base and enhance its distribution channels the company has completed a number of acquisitions in recent years and expects to make additional acquisitions in the future but may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or if suitable candidates are identified the company may not be able to complete the business combination on commercially acceptable terms the process of exploring and pursuing acquisition opportunities may result in devotion of significant management and financial resources 

even if the company is able to consummate acquisitions that it believes will be successful such transactions present many risks including among others difficulty in integrating the management teams strategies cultures and operations of the companies failing to achieve anticipated synergies and revenue increases difficulty incorporating and integrating the acquired technologies or products with the companys existing product lines difficulty in coordinating establishing or expanding sales distribution and marketing functions as necessary difficulty in training the global sales team to sell the acquired products failure to develop new products and services that utilize the technologies and resources of the companies disruption of the companys ongoing business and diversion of managements attention to transition or integration issues unanticipated and unknown liabilities the loss of key employees customers partners and channel partners of the company or of the acquired company resulting in the loss of key information expertise or knowhow and unanticipated additional recruitment and training costs infringement of intellectual property rights difficulties implementing and maintaining sufficient controls policies and procedures over the systems products and processes of the acquired company and cybersecurity risks if the company does not achieve the anticipated benefits of its acquisitions as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by the companys management and financial or industry analysts there could be a material adverse effect on the companys stock price business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

in addition for companies acquired limited experience will exist for several quarters following the acquisition relating to how the acquired companys sales pipelines will convert into sales or revenues and the conversion rate postacquisition may be quite different than the historical conversion rate because a substantial portion of the companys sales are completed in the latter part of a quarter and its cost structure is largely fixed in the shortterm revenue shortfalls may have a negative impact on the companys profitability a delay in a small number of large new software license transactions could cause the companys quarterly software license revenues to fall significantly short of its predictions 

the company may periodically be involved in business combinations with enterprises that are developmental in nature while these entities have leadingedge technology they may not have developed direct or indirect distribution channels and may not have software revenues which cover the ongoing expenses therefore the company may have a decrease in operating margin and profitability while these types of acquisitions are integrated and the distribution channel incorporates the new product offerings 

as the company continues to expand through acquisition or strategic transactions the acquisition of entities or entry into strategic partnerships with companies that will be viewed as competitors by other strategic partners may become more likely such acquisitions could have an adverse effect on partnerships or impact sales of the companys products which could negatively impact the company’s results 

disruption of operations or infrastructure failures  a significant portion of the companys software development personnel source code and computer equipment is located at operating facilities in the united states canada india japan and throughout europe the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unforeseen catastrophe at any of these facilities could cause interruptions in the companys operations services and product development activities additionally if the company experiences problems that impair its business infrastructure such as a computer virus telephone system failure or an intentional disruption of its information technology systems by a third party these interruptions could have a material adverse effect on the companys business financial position results of operations cash flows and the ability to meet financial reporting deadlines further because the companys sales are not generally linear during any quarterly period the potential adverse effects resulting from any of the events described above or any other disruption of the companys business could be accentuated if it occurs close to the end of a fiscal quarter 

risks associated with significant sales to existing customers  a significant portion of the companys sales includes followon sales to existing customers that invest in the companys broad suite of engineering simulation software and services if a significant number of current customers were to become dissatisfied with the companys products and services or choose to license or utilize competitive offerings the companys followon sales and recurring lease and maintenance revenues could be materially adversely impacted resulting in reduced revenue operating margins net income and cash flows 

industry consolidation  consolidation in industries that utilize the company’s software may result in combined workforces 

where economies of scale and synergies are achieved and fewer ansys software licenses are required consolidation may 

also result in the newly combinedsurviving entity wanting the most favorable pricing from the former contracts and expecting 

larger volume discounts on future purchases if a customer is acquired by an entity that does not utilize ansys in favor of a competing product the company may not have future orders from the enterprise further consolidation of the companys competitors may result in synergies that allow those competitors to benefit from broader sales channels and increased access to capital any of these impacts could adversely affect the companys business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

periodic reorganization of sales force  the company relies heavily on its direct sales force from time to time the company reorganizes and makes adjustments to its sales leadership andor its sales force in response to such factors as management changes performance issues market opportunities and other considerations these changes may result in a temporary lack of sales production and may adversely impact revenue in future quarters there can be no assurance that the company will not restructure its sales force in future periods or that the transition issues associated with such a restructuring will not occur 

governmental revenue sources the companys sales to the united states government must comply with federal acquisition regulations failure to comply with these regulations could result in penalties being assessed against the company or an order preventing the company from making future sales to the united states government further the companys international activities must comply with the export control laws of the united states and other countries the foreign corrupt practices act the united kingdom bribery act of 2010 and a variety of other laws and regulations of the united states and other countries in which the company operates failure to comply with any of these laws and regulations could adversely affect the companys business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

in certain circumstances the united states government state and local governments and their respective agencies and certain foreign governments may have the right to terminate contractual arrangements at any time without cause the united states european union and certain other government contracts as well as the companys state and local level contracts are subject to the approval of appropriations or funding authorizations certain of these contracts permit the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions including but not limited to termination of contracts refund of a portion of fees received forfeiture of profits suspension of payments fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business any of which could have an adverse effect on the companys results of operations and cash flows 

contingencies  the company is subject to various investigations claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business including commercial disputes labor and employment matters tax audits and litigations alleged infringement of intellectual property rights and other matters use or distribution of the company’s products could generate product liability regulatory infraction or similar claims by the customers or end users of the company or its indirect sales partners government entities or other third parties each of these matters is subject to various uncertainties and it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could materially affect the companys results of operations cash flows and financial position 

income tax estimates  the company makes significant estimates in determining its worldwide income tax provision these estimates involve complex tax regulations in a number of jurisdictions across the companys global operations and are subject to many transactions and calculations in which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain the final outcome of tax matters could be different than the estimates reflected in the historical income tax provision and related accruals such differences could have a material impact on income tax expense and net income in the periods in which such determinations are made 

the amount of income tax paid by the company is subject to ongoing audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities these audits can result in additional assessments including interest and penalties the companys estimate for liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions is highly judgmental and actual future outcomes may result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to the companys estimated tax liabilities including estimates for uncertain tax positions in the period the assessments are made or resolved audits are closed or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire as a result the companys effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly or annual basis 

the company allocates a portion of its purchase price to goodwill and intangible assets impairment charges associated with goodwill are generally not taxdeductible and will result in an increased effective income tax rate in the period the impairment is recorded the company has recorded significant deferred tax liabilities related to acquired intangible assets that are not 

deductible for tax purposes these deferred tax liabilities are based on future statutory tax rates in the locations in which the intangible assets are recorded any future changes in statutory tax rates would be recorded as an adjustment to the deferred tax liabilities in the period the change is announced and could have a material impact on the companys effective tax rate during that period 

changes in tax law the companys operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions a change in the tax law in the jurisdictions in which the company does business including an increase in tax rates an adverse change in the treatment of an item of income or expense or a decrease in tax rates in a jurisdiction in which the company has significant deferred tax assets could result in a material increase in tax expense currently a substantial portion of the companys revenue is generated from customers located outside the united states and a substantial portion of assets are located outside the united states changes in existing taxation rules or practices new taxation rules or varying interpretations of current taxation practices could have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations or the manner in which the company conducts its business 

interest rates borrowings under the companys revolving credit facility use the london interbank offering rate libor as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate libor is the subject of recent national international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform these reforms and other pressures may cause libor to disappear entirely or to perform differently than in the past the consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted but could include an increase in the cost of the companys variable rate indebtedness 

changes in existing financial accounting standards changes in existing accounting rules or practices new accounting pronouncements or varying interpretations of current accounting pronouncements could have a significant adverse effect on the companys results of operations or the manner in which the company conducts its business 

in addition the company could incur significant costs for changes to its business systems processes and internal controls as a result of the transition these costs could have a significant adverse impact on the companys results of operations and cash flows the transition could also cause management to divert time from the daytoday operations of the company which could impact the companys business if the company is unable to successfully transition its business systems processes and internal controls before the guidance effective date it could impact the ability to meet financial reporting deadlines for further information on the impact of recently issued accounting guidance on the company see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k

under asc 605 the company experienced higher revenue during the year ended december 31 2018  across all classes of revenue including license revenue maintenance and services the company also experienced increased operating expenses primarily due to increased personnel costs higher stockbased compensation and optis expenses for the period from the acquisition date may 2 2018 through december 31 2018 these increases were partially offset by restructuring in 2017 that did not reoccur in 2018 

the nongaap results exclude the income statement effects of the acquisition accounting adjustment to deferred revenue stockbased compensation amortization of acquired intangible assets restructuring charges transaction costs related to business combinations and the impact of the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act for further disclosure regarding nongaap results see the section titled nongaap results immediately preceding the section titled liquidity and capital resources

factors for a complete discussion of factors that might impact the companys financial condition and operating results the company believes that the features functionality and integrated multiphysics capabilities of its software products are as strong as they have ever been however the software business is generally characterized by long sales cycles these long sales cycles increase the difficulty of predicting sales for any particular quarter the company makes many operational and strategic decisions based upon short and longterm sales forecasts that are impacted not only by these long sales cycles but also by current global economic conditions as a result the company believes that its overall performance is best measured by fiscal year results rather than by quarterly results please see the subsection entitled sales forecasts under item 1a risk factors for a complete discussion of the potential impact of the companys sales forecasts on the companys financial condition cash flows and operating results

due to the change in revenue recognition under asc 606 the asc 606 growth rates presented above which compare the 2018 results under asc 606 to the 2017 results under asc 605 are less representative of the underlying operations of each region than those presented under asc 605 

the company continues to focus on a number of sales improvement activities across the geographic regions including sales hiring pipeline building productivity initiatives and customer engagement activities

for further information on the companys business combinations during the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k 

results of operations 

for purposes of the following discussion and analysis the table below sets forth certain consolidated financial data for the years 2018  2017  and 2016  the operating results of the companys acquisitions have been included in the results of operations since their respective acquisition dates 



year ended december 31 2018  compared to year ended december 31 2017 

revenue 



the adoption of asc 606 significantly impacted the timing allocation and presentation of lease license perpetual license and maintenance revenue for further information on the impact of this adoption on the companys results see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k 

for purposes of comparability the changes in the following table and the related discussion that follows are presented in accordance with asc 605 



the company’s asc 605 revenue in the year ended december 31 2018  increased 111  as compared to the year ended december 31 2017  while revenue grew 97  in constant currency the growth rate was favorably impacted by the company’s continued investment in its global sales support and marketing organizations continued progress with market segmentation and gotomarket adjustments and the may 2018 acquisition of optis lease license revenue increased 118  or 107  in constant currency as compared to the year ended december 31 2017  perpetual license revenue which is derived primarily from new sales during the year increased 30  or 20  in constant currency as compared to the year ended december 31 2017  annual maintenance contracts that were sold with new perpetual licenses along with maintenance contracts for perpetual licenses sold in previous quarters contributed to maintenance revenue growth of 134  or 116  in constant currency service revenue driven primarily by a focus on service offerings that provide onsite mentorship on simulation best practices training and expanding simulation adoption increased 343  or 334  in constant currency as compared to the year ended december 31 2017  

with respect to revenue on average for the year ended december 31 2018  the us dollar was approximately 23  weaker and 26  weaker when measured against the company’s primary foreign currencies than for the year ended december 31 2017  under asc 606 and asc 605 respectively the table below presents the impacts of currency fluctuations on revenue for the year ended december 31 2018  amounts in brackets indicate a net adverse impact from currency fluctuations 



the net overall weaker us dollar also resulted in increased operating income of 96 million  and 103 million  for the year ended december 31 2018  as compared to the year ended december 31 2017  under asc 606 and asc 605 respectively 

a substantial portion of the companys lease license and maintenance revenue is derived from annual lease and maintenance contracts these contracts are generally renewed on an annual basis and have a high rate of customer renewal in addition to the recurring revenue base associated with these contracts a majority of customers purchasing new perpetual licenses also purchase related annual maintenance contracts as a result of the significant recurring revenue base the companys lease license and maintenance revenue growth rate in any period does not necessarily correlate to the growth rate of new licenses sold during that period under asc 605 the same is true for maintenance revenue growth under asc 606 however under asc 606 lease license revenue is entirely attributed to license sales completed during the period resulting in a higher correlation of lease license revenue growth to the growth rate of new lease license sales than that under asc 605 to the extent the rate of customer renewal for lease and maintenance contracts is high incremental lease contracts and maintenance contracts sold with new perpetual licenses will result in lease license and maintenance growth in constant currency conversely if the rate of renewal for these contracts is adversely affected by economic or other factors the companys lease license and maintenance growth will be adversely affected 

the company has been experiencing an increased interest by some of its larger customers in enterprise agreements that often include longerterm timebased licenses involving a larger number of the companys software products while these arrangements typically involve a higher overall transaction price the revenue from these contracts is typically deferred and recognized over the period of the contract under asc 605 resulting in increased deferred revenue and backlog to the extent these types of contracts replace sales of perpetual licenses there could be a nearterm adverse impact on software license and maintenance revenue growth under asc 606 the upfront recognition of license revenue related to these larger multiyear transactions can result in significantly higher lease license revenue volatility as software products across a large variety of applications and industries become increasingly distributed in softwareasaservice cloud and other subscription environments in which the licensing approach is timebased rather than perpetual the company is also experiencing a shifting preference from perpetual licenses to timebased licenses across a broader spectrum of its customers particularly in the more mature geographic markets such as the us and japan 

as a percentage of revenue the companys international and domestic revenues and the companys direct and indirect revenues are as follows 



in valuing deferred revenue on the balance sheets of the companys recent acquisitions as of their respective acquisition dates the company applied the fair value provisions applicable to the accounting for business combinations resulting in a reduction 

of deferred revenue as compared to its historical carrying amount as a result the companys postacquisition revenue will be less than the sum of what would have otherwise been reported by ansys and each acquiree absent the acquisitions under asc 606 the impacts on reported revenue were 94 million  for the year ended december 31 2018  the expected impacts on reported revenue including an estimate for the granta and helic acquisitions are 22 million and 65 million for the quarter ending march 31 2019 and the year ending december 31 2019  respectively the company has not yet performed a valuation of the granta and helic acquired deferred revenue until such valuation is completed the expected impacts on revenue will remain preliminary estimates that are likely to change under asc 605 the impacts on reported revenue were 156 million  and 29 million for the years ended december 31 2018  and 2017 respectively 

cost of sales and operating expenses 

the tables below reflect the companys operating results as presented on the consolidated statements of income which are inclusive of foreign currency translation impacts the adoption of asc 606 resulted in a reclassification of expenses within cost of sales from software licenses to maintenance and service amounts included in the discussion that follows are provided in constant currency and do not include the impact of the optis acquisition the impact of the optis acquisition on each expense line is provided separately where material the impact where material of foreign exchange translation on each expense line is also provided separately and is inclusive of the optis acquisition 



software licenses  the net decrease in the cost of software licenses was primarily due to the following 

 amortization  the decrease in amortization expense was primarily due to a net decrease in the amortization of trade names and acquired technology due to assets that became fully amortized 

maintenance and service  the increase in maintenance and service costs was primarily due to the following 

 the improvement in gross profit was a result of the increase in revenue partially offset by the increase in the related cost of sales 



selling general and administrative  the net increase in selling general and administrative costs was primarily due to the following 

 the company anticipates that it will continue to make targeted investments in its global sales and marketing organizations and its global business infrastructure to enhance and support its revenuegenerating activities 

research and development  the net increase in research and development costs was primarily due to the following 

 the company has traditionally invested significant resources in research and development activities and intends to continue to make investments in expanding the ease of use and capabilities of its broad portfolio of simulation software products 

interest income  interest income for the year ended december 31 2018  was 114 million  as compared to 70 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  interest income increased as a result of an increase in the average rate of return on invested cash balances 

other expense net  the companys other expense net consists of the following 



income tax provision  the companys income before income tax provision income tax provision and effective tax rate were as follows 



on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act tax reform tax reform makes broad and complex changes to the us tax code including but not limited to 1 reducing the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent 2 requiring companies to pay a onetime federal income tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries transition tax 3 generally eliminating us federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries 4 creating a new provision designed to tax global intangible lowtaxed income gilti which allows for the possibility of using foreign tax credits ftcs and a deduction of up to 50 percent to offset the income tax liability subject to some limitations 5 repealing the domestic production activity deduction 6 creating the foreignderived intangible income deduction 7 creating the base erosion antiabuse tax a new minimum tax 8 allowing for full expensing of qualified property through bonus depreciation and 9 creating limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation 

the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin sab 118 which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of tax reform sab 118 provided a measurement period that was limited to one year from enactment for companies to complete the accounting under asc 740 income taxes  in accordance with sab 118 throughout the measurement period a company must reflect the income tax effects of those aspects of tax reform for which the accounting under asc 740 was complete in the financial statements to the extent that a company’s accounting for certain income tax effects of tax reform was incomplete but a reasonable estimate was able to be made the company must record a provisional estimate in the financial statements if a company could not determine a provisional estimate to be included in the financial statements it should continue to apply asc 740 on the basis of the tax laws that were in effect immediately before the enactment of tax reform 

as further discussed below the company finalized its provisional tax reform calculations as of the end of the measurement period based on guidance and information available as of the reporting date the us government has not yet issued final guidance related to the new rules enacted as part of tax reform subsequent adjustments if any will be recorded in the period in which guidance is finalized 

the company’s accounting for the impact of the reduction in the us federal corporate tax rate on the companys deferred tax assets and liabilities is complete tax reform reduced the corporate tax rate to 21 percent effective january 1 2018 consequently the company recorded a net adjustment to deferred income tax expense of 19 million for the year ended december 31 2017 to revalue the company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities no further adjustments were recorded for the year ended december 31 2018 

the company’s accounting for the transition tax is complete reasonable estimates of certain effects were calculated and a provisional adjustment of 160 million was recorded in the december 31 2017 financial statements to determine the amount of the transition tax the company determined in addition to other factors the amount of post1986 earnings and profits ep of the relevant subsidiaries as well as the amount of nonus income taxes paid on such earnings based on revised ep calculations updated during the measurement period the company recognized an additional measurementperiod adjustment of 09 million to the transition tax obligation and a corresponding adjustment to tax expense resulting in a total transition tax obligation of 169 million the company has elected to pay this liability over eight years however in accordance with irs issued guidance tax overpayments from the year ended december 31 2017 are required to be applied to the transition tax obligation based on this guidance 156 million of the obligation has been paid with the remaining 13 million recorded in other longterm liabilities at december 31 2018 

the company’s accounting for the indefinite reinvestment assertion is complete in general it is the practice and intention of the company to repatriate previously taxed earnings in excess of working capital needs and to reinvest all other earnings of its nonus subsidiaries as part of tax reform the company incurred us tax on substantially all of the earnings of its nonus subsidiaries as part of the transition tax this tax increased the company’s previously taxed earnings and allows for the repatriation of the majority of its foreign earnings without any residual us federal tax the company does not believe that there is an excess of the financial reporting basis over the tax basis of investments in foreign subsidiaries accordingly any repatriation in excess of previously taxed earnings will be a nontaxable return of basis during the year ended december 31 2018 the company repatriated 1443 million of foreign cash the company has not made any measurementperiod adjustments related to its indefinite reinvestment assertion during the year ended december 31 2018 

the company’s accounting policy choice for gilti is complete under us gaap the company is allowed to make an accounting policy choice of either 1 treating taxes due on future us inclusions in taxable income related to gilti as a currentperiod expense when incurred the period cost method or 2 factoring such amounts into the company’s measurement of its deferred taxes the deferred method the company selected the period cost method and recorded gilti tax expense of 04 million in the financial statements for the year ended december 31 2018 

the decrease in the effective tax rate from the prior year is primarily due to the reduction in the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent enacted as part of tax reform the additional 151 million of transition tax in 2017 when compared to 2018 and a net 67 million benefit related to global legal entity restructuring activities the effective tax rate was also reduced by the foreignderived intangible income deduction increased research and development credits and increased stockbased compensation benefits partially offset by the loss of the domestic manufacturing deduction which was repealed as part of tax reform when compared to the federal and state combined statutory rate the effective tax rates for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 were favorably impacted by tax benefits from stockbased compensation and research and development credits

as a percentage of revenue the companys international and domestic revenues and the companys direct and indirect revenues are as follows 



in valuing deferred revenue on the balance sheets of the companys recent acquisitions as of their respective acquisition dates the company applied the fair value provisions applicable to the accounting for business combinations resulting in a reduction of deferred revenue as compared to its historical carrying amount as a result the companys postacquisition revenue will be less than the sum of what would have otherwise been reported by ansys and each acquiree absent the acquisitions the impacts on reported revenue for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 were 29 million and 01 million respectively

other expense net  the companys other expense net consists of the following 



income tax provision  the companys income before income tax provision income tax provision and effective tax rate were as follows

the company provides nongaap revenue nongaap operating income nongaap operating profit margin nongaap net income and nongaap diluted earnings per share as supplemental measures to gaap regarding the companys operational performance these financial measures exclude the impact of certain items and therefore have not been calculated in accordance with gaap a detailed explanation and a reconciliation of each nongaap financial measure to its most comparable gaap financial measure are described below 



 



 

 nongaap measures 

management uses nongaap financial measures a to evaluate the companys historical and prospective financial performance as well as its performance relative to its competitors b to set internal sales targets and spending budgets c to allocate resources d to measure operational profitability and the accuracy of forecasting e to assess financial discipline over operational expenditures and f as an important factor in determining variable compensation for management and its employees in addition many financial analysts that follow the company focus on and publish both historical results and future projections based on nongaap financial measures the company believes that it is in the best interest of its investors to provide this information to analysts so that they accurately report the nongaap financial information moreover investors have historically requested and the company has historically reported these nongaap financial measures as a means of providing consistent and comparable information with past reports of financial results   

while management believes that these nongaap financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors there are limitations associated with the use of these nongaap financial measures these nongaap financial measures are not prepared in accordance with gaap are not reported by all the companys competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of the companys competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation the company compensates for these limitations by using these nongaap financial measures as supplements to gaap financial measures and by reviewing the reconciliations of the nongaap financial measures to their most comparable gaap financial measures   

the adjustments to these nongaap financial measures and the basis for such adjustments are outlined below   

acquisition accounting for deferred revenue and its related tax impact historically the company has consummated acquisitions in order to support its strategic and other business objectives in accordance with the fair value provisions applicable to the accounting for business combinations acquired deferred revenue is often recorded on the opening balance sheet at an amount that is lower than the historical carrying value although this acquisition accounting requirement has no impact on the companys business or cash flow it adversely impacts the companys reported gaap revenue in the reporting periods following an acquisition in order to provide investors with financial information that facilitates comparison of both historical and future results the company provides nongaap financial measures which exclude the impact of the acquisition accounting adjustment the company believes that this nongaap financial adjustment is useful to investors because it allows investors to a evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in its financial and operational decisionmaking and b compare past and future reports of financial results of the company as the revenue reduction related to acquired deferred revenue will not recur when related annual lease licenses and software maintenance contracts are renewed in future periods

restructuring charges and the related tax impact  the company occasionally incurs expenses for restructuring its workforce included in its gaap presentation of cost of software licenses cost of maintenance and service research and development expense and selling general and administrative expense management excludes these expenses for the purpose of calculating nongaap operating income nongaap operating profit margin nongaap net income and nongaap diluted earnings per share when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the company as it generally does not incur these expenses as a part of its operations the company believes that these nongaap financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to a evaluate the companys operating results and the effectiveness of the methodology used by management to review the companys operating results and b review historical comparability in the companys financial reporting as well as comparability with competitors operating results   

transaction costs related to business combinations the company incurs expenses for professional services rendered in connection with business combinations which are included in its gaap presentation of selling general and administrative expense these expenses are generally not taxdeductible management excludes these acquisitionrelated transaction expenses derived from announced acquisitions for the purpose of calculating nongaap operating income nongaap operating profit margin nongaap net income and nongaap diluted earnings per share when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the company as it generally would not have otherwise incurred these expenses in the periods presented as a part of its operations the company believes that these nongaap financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to a evaluate the companys operating results and the effectiveness of the methodology used by management to review the companys operating results and b review historical comparability in the companys financial reporting as well as comparability with competitors operating results   

tax cuts and jobs act the company recorded charges in its income tax provision related to the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act specifically for the transition tax related to unrepatriated cash and the impacts of the tax rate change on net deferred tax assets management excludes these charges for the purpose of calculating nongaap net income and nongaap diluted earnings per share when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the company as i the charges are not expected to recur as part of its normal operations and ii the charges resulted from the extremely infrequent event of major us tax reform the last such reform having occurred in 1986 the company believes that these nongaap financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to a evaluate the companys operating results and the effectiveness of the methodology used by management to review the companys operating results and b review historical comparability in the companys financial reporting   

nongaap financial measures are not in accordance with or an alternative for gaap the companys nongaap financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable gaap financial measures and should be read only in conjunction with the companys consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap   

the company has provided a reconciliation of the nongaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures as listed below

the companys significant contractual obligations as of december 31 2018  are summarized below 





critical accounting policies and estimates 

the company believes that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition   the companys revenue is derived principally from the licensing of computer software products and from related maintenance contracts the company adopted asc 606 on january 1 2018 using the modified retrospective approach for all contracts not completed as of the date of adoption results for reporting periods beginning after january 1 2018 are presented under asc 606 while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with asc 605 revenue recognition  asc 605 the adoption of asc 606 represents a change in accounting principle that will more closely align revenue recognition with the delivery of the company’s software licenses maintenance and services 

revenue recognition policy 2018 asc 606 

the company enters into contracts that include combinations of products maintenance and services which are accounted for as separate performance obligations with differing revenue recognition patterns 

revenue from perpetual licenses is classified as software license revenue software license revenue is recognized up front upon delivery of the licensed product andor the utility that enables the customer to access authorization keys provided that a signed contract has been received typically the company’s perpetual licenses are sold with postcontract support pcs which includes unspecified technical enhancements and customer support the company allocates value in bundled perpetual and pcs arrangements based on the standalone selling prices of the perpetual license and pcs revenue from pcs is classified as maintenance revenue and is recognized ratably over the term of the contract as the company satisfies the pcs performance obligation over time 

in addition to perpetual licenses the company sells timebased lease licenses lease licenses are sold only as a bundled arrangement that includes the rights to a term software license and pcs utilizing observable inputs the company determined that 50  of the estimated standalone selling price of the lease license is attributable to the term license and 50  is attributable to the pcs consistent with the perpetual sales the license component is classified as software license revenue and recognized as revenue up front at the commencement of the lease the pcs is classified as maintenance revenue and is recognized ratably over the term of the contract as the company provides the pcs benefit over time 

revenue from training support and other services is recognized as the services are performed for contracts in which the service consists of a single performance obligation such as providing a training class to a customer the company recognizes revenue upon completion of the performance obligation for service contracts that are longer in duration and often include multiple performance obligations for example both training and consulting the company measures the progress toward completion of the obligations and recognizes revenue accordingly in measuring progress towards the completion of performance obligations the company typically utilizes outputbased estimates for services with contractual billing arrangements that are not based on time and materials and estimates output based on the total tasks completed as compared to the total tasks required for each work contract inputbased estimates are utilized for services that involve general consultations with contractual billing arrangements based on time and materials utilizing direct labor as the input measure 

the company also executes arrangements through independent channel partners in which the channel partners are authorized to market and distribute the companys software products to end users of the companys products and services in specified territories in sales facilitated by channel partners the channel partner bears the risk of collection from the enduser customer the company recognizes revenue from transactions with channel partners at a point in time or over time as appropriate when the channel partner submits a purchase commitment collectability from the channel partner is probable a license agreement signed by the enduser customer is received and the performance obligation was met revenue from channel partner transactions is the amount remitted to the company by the channel partners this amount includes a fee for pcs that is compensation for providing technical enhancements and the second level of technical support to the end user which is recognized over the period that pcs is to be provided the company does not offer right of return product rotation or price protection to any of its channel partners 

nonincome related taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as accounts receivable and accrued expenses the collection and payment of these amounts are reported on a net basis in the consolidated statements of income and do not impact reported revenues or expenses 

the company warrants to its customers that its software will perform substantially as specified in the companys current user manuals the company has not experienced significant claims related to software warranties beyond the scope of maintenance support which the company is already obligated to provide the warranty is not sold and cannot be purchased separately the warranty does not provide any type of additional service to the customer or performance obligation for the company 

the companys agreements with its customers generally require it to indemnify the customer against claims that the companys software infringes thirdparty patent copyright trademark or other proprietary rights such indemnification obligations are 

generally limited in a variety of industrystandard respects including the companys right to replace an infringing product as of december 31 2018  the company had not experienced any losses related to these indemnification obligations and no claims with respect thereto were outstanding the company does not expect significant claims related to these indemnification obligations and consequently the company has not established any related reserves 

significant judgments asc 606 

the company’s contracts with customers typically include promises to transfer licenses and services to a customer judgment is required to determine if the promises are separate performance obligations and if so the allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation the company uses the estimated standalone selling price method to allocate the transaction price for items that are not sold separately particularly lease licenses sold with pcs the estimated standalone selling price is determined using all information reasonably available to the company including market conditions and other observable inputs the corresponding revenues are recognized as the related performance obligations are satisfied 

the company applies a practical expedient to expense sales commissions as incurred when the amortization period would have been one year or less sales commissions associated with the initial year of multiyear contracts are expensed as incurred due to their immateriality sales commissions associated with multiyear contracts beyond the initial year are subject to an employee service requirement and are expensed as incurred as they are not considered incremental costs to obtain a contract 

the company is required to adjust promised amounts of consideration for the effects of the time value of money if the timing of the payments provides the customer or the company with a significant financing benefit the company considers various factors in assessing whether a financing component exists including the duration of the contract market interest rates and the timing of payments the company’s contracts do not include a significant financing component requiring adjustment to the transaction price 

revenue recognition policy 2017 and 2016 asc 605 

revenue from perpetual licenses was classified as license revenue and was recognized upon delivery of the licensed product andor the utility that enabled the customer to access authorization keys provided that acceptance had occurred and a signed contractual obligation was received the price was fixed and determinable and collectibility of the receivable was probable the company determined the fair value of pcs sold together with perpetual licenses based on the rate charged for pcs when sold separately revenue from pcs contracts was classified as maintenance and service revenue and was recognized ratably over the term of the contract 

revenue for software lease licenses was classified as license revenue and was recognized over the period of the lease contract typically the companys software leases include pcs which due to the short term principally one year or less of the companys software lease licenses could not be separated from lease revenue for accounting purposes as a result both the lease licenses and pcs were recognized ratably over the lease period the company included the revenue for the entire lease arrangement within software license revenue in the consolidated statements of income 

many of the companys semiconductor products were typically licensed via longer term leases of 24–36 months the company recognized revenue for these licenses over the term of the lease contract because the company did not have vendorspecific objective evidence of the fair value of these leases the company also recognized revenue from perpetual licenses over the term of the lease contract during the infrequent occurrence of these licenses being sold with semiconductor leases in multipleelement arrangements 

revenue from training support and other services was recognized as the services were performed the company applied the specific performance method to contracts in which the service consisted of a single act such as providing a training class to a customer and the proportional performance method to other service contracts that were longer in duration and often included multiple acts for example both training and consulting in applying the proportional performance method the company typically utilized outputbased estimates for services with contractual billing arrangements that were not based on time and materials and estimated output based on the total tasks completed as compared to the total tasks required for each work contract inputbased estimates were utilized for services that involved general consultations with contractual billing arrangements based on time and materials utilizing direct labor as the input measure 

the accounting treatment under asc 605 associated with arrangements through independent channel partners nonincome related taxes warranties and indemnification obligations is consistent with asc 606 described above 

allowance for doubtful accounts   the company makes judgments as to its ability to collect outstanding receivables and provides allowances for a portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices from both value and delinquency perspectives for those invoices not specifically reviewed provisions are provided at differing rates based upon the age of the receivable and the geographic area of origin in determining these percentages the company considers its historical collection experience and current economic trends in the 

customers industry and geographic region if the historical data used to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and future results of operations could be materially affected 

income taxes  the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period of the enactment date 

the company records net deferred tax assets to the extent it believes these assets will more likely than not be realized in making such determination the company considers all available positive and negative evidence including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and recent financial operations in the event the company determines that it will be able to realize deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance was used to reduce their carrying value the adjustment to the valuation allowance will be recorded as a reduction to the provision for income taxes 

tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a morelikelythannot threshold otherwise these tax benefits are recorded when a tax position has been effectively settled which means that the statute of limitations has expired or the appropriate taxing authority has completed their examination even though the statute of limitations remains open 

the company recognizes interest and penalties related to income taxes within the income tax expense line in the consolidated statements of income accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheets 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets  the company tests goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment at least annually by performing a quantitative assessment of whether the fair value of each reporting unit or asset exceeds its carrying amount the company has one reporting unit goodwill is tested at this reporting unit level and indefinitelived intangible assets are tested at the individual asset level this requires the company to assess and make judgments regarding a variety of factors which impact the fair value of the reporting unit or asset being tested including business plans anticipated future cash flows economic projections and other market data because there are inherent uncertainties involved in these factors significant differences between these estimates and actual results could result in future impairment charges and could materially impact the companys future financial results during the first quarter of 2018  the company completed the annual impairment test for goodwill and the indefinitelived intangible asset and determined that these assets had not been impaired as of the test date january 1 2018  no other events or circumstances changed during the year ended december 31 2018  that would indicate that the fair values of the companys reporting unit and indefinitelived intangible asset are below their carrying values 

contingencies    the company is involved in various investigations claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business including commercial disputes labor and employment matters tax audits alleged infringement of intellectual property rights and other matters the company reviews the status of these matters assesses its financial exposure and records a related accrual if the potential loss from an investigation claim or legal proceeding is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable significant judgment is involved in the determination of probability and in the determination of whether an exposure is reasonably estimable as a result of the uncertainties involved in making these estimates the company may have to revise its estimates as facts and circumstances change the revision of these estimates could have a material impact on the companys financial position and results of operations 

stockbased compensation  the company grants restricted stock units and other stock awards to employees and directors under the companys equity incentive plan eligible employees can also purchase shares of the companys common stock at a discount under the companys employee stock purchase plan the benefits provided under these plans are sharebased payments subject to the provisions of sharebased payment accounting guidance the company uses the fair value method to apply the provisions of sharebased payment accounting guidance stockbased compensation expense for 2018  2017  and 2016  was 833 million  532 million  and 333 million  respectively as of december 31 2018  total unrecognized estimated compensation expense related to unvested stock options and awards granted prior to that date was 1411 million  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 16 years  

the value of each stock option award was estimated on the date of grant or date of acquisition for options issued in a business combination using the blackscholes option pricing model blackscholes model the determination of the fair value of sharebased payment awards using an option pricing model is affected by the companys stock price as well as assumptions 

regarding a number of complex and subjective variables these variables include the companys expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors riskfree interest rates and expected dividends the table below presents the weighted average input assumptions used and resulting fair values for options granted or issued in business combinations during each respective year the stockbased compensation expense for options is recorded ratably over the requisite service period the interest rate assumptions were determined by using the fiveyear us treasury note yield on the date of grant or date of acquisition the company did not grant stock option awards during 2018 or 2017 

the company issues various restricted stock unit awards which contain a market condition a performance condition a service condition or any combination of the three restricted stock unit awards are valued based on the grantdate fair value of the award stockbased compensation expense is recognized over the employees requisite service period for awards with only a service condition for awards with a performance condition stockbased compensation expense is recorded from the service inception date through the conclusion of the measurement period based on managements estimates concerning the probability of vesting 

vesting of restricted stock unit awards with a market condition is based on the companys performance as measured by total shareholder return relative to the appreciation of a specified stock index over the measurement period subject to each participants continued employment with the company through the conclusion of the measurement period the fair value of the restricted stock unit awards with a market condition is estimated using a monte carlo simulation model the determination of the fair value of the awards is affected by the grant date and a number of variables each of which has been identified in the chart below for awards granted during each respective period sharebased compensation expense based on the fair value of the award is being recorded from the grant date through the conclusion of the measurement period 



the company also grants restricted stock units to nonemployee directors which vest upon the earlier of one year from the date of grant or the date of the next regular annual meeting of stockholders 

to the extent the company changes the terms of its stockbased compensation programs experiences market volatility in the pricing of its common stock that increases the implied volatility assumption used in the blackscholes model refines different assumptions or assumes stock awards from acquired companies that are different in nature than the companys stock award arrangements among other potential impacts the stockbased compensation expense recorded in future periods and the related tax benefits may differ significantly from what was recorded in previous reporting periods the company accounts for forfeitures of stockbased awards as they occur 

estimates of stockbased compensation expense are significant to the companys financial statements but this expense is partially based on the aforementioned option valuation and monte carlo simulation models and will never result in the payment of cash by the company other than through the payment of withholding taxes in lieu of additional share issuance for this reason and because the company does not view stockbased compensation as related to its operational performance the board of directors and management exclude stockbased compensation expense when evaluating the companys underlying business performance

competition 

the company believes that the principal factors affecting sales of its software include ease of use breadth and depth of functionality flexibility quality ease of integration with other software systems file compatibility across computer platforms range of supported computer platforms performance price and total cost of ownership customer service and support company reputation and financial viability and effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts 

the company continues to experience competition across all markets for its products and services some of the companys current and possible future competitors have greater financial technical marketing and other resources than the company and some have wellestablished relationships with current and potential customers of the company the companys current and possible future competitors also include firms that have elected or may in the future elect to compete by means of open source licensing these competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes price reductions andor increased operating costs and could result in lower revenues margins and net income 

proprietary rights and licenses 

the company regards its software as proprietary and relies on a combination of trade secret copyright patent and trademark laws license agreements nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect its proprietary rights in its products the company distributes its software products under software license agreements that grant customers nonexclusive licenses which are typically nontransferable for the use of the companys products license agreements for the companys products are directly between the company and end users use of the licensed software product is restricted to specified sites unless the customer obtains a multisite license for its use of the software product or the software product is by its nature a multisite use product software security measures are also employed to prevent unauthorized use of the companys software products and the licensed software is subject to terms and conditions prohibiting unauthorized reproduction for most products customers may purchase a perpetual license of the technology with the right to annually purchase ongoing maintenance technical support and upgrades or may lease the product on a fixedterm basis for a fee that includes the license maintenance technical support and upgrades for its discovery products customers purchase an annual subscription for a certain number of named users that includes the license maintenance technical support and upgrades 

the company licenses its software products utilizing a combination of webbased and hardcopy license terms and forms for certain software products the company primarily relies on clickwrapped licenses the enforceability of these types of agreements under the laws of some jurisdictions is uncertain 

the company also seeks to protect the source code of its software as a trade secret and as unpublished copyrighted work the company has obtained federal trademark registration protection for ansys and other marks in the us and foreign countries additionally the company was awarded numerous patents by the us patent and trademark office and has a number of patent applications pending to the extent the company does not choose to seek patent protection for its intellectual property the company primarily relies on the protection of its source code as a trade secret 

employees of the company have signed agreements under which they have agreed not to disclose trade secrets or confidential information these agreements where legally permitted restrict engagement in or connection with any business that is competitive with the company anywhere in the world while employed by the company and in some cases for specified periods thereafter and state that any products or technology created by employees during their term of employment are the property of the company in addition the company requires all channel partners to enter into agreements not to disclose the companys trade secrets and other proprietary information 

despite these precautions there can be no assurance that misappropriation of the companys technology and proprietary information including source code will be prevented further there can be no assurance that copyright trademark patent and trade secret protection will be available for the companys products in certain jurisdictions or that restrictions on the ability of employees and channel partners to engage in activities competitive with the company will be enforceable costly and time 

consuming litigation could be necessary in the future to enforce the companys rights to its trade secrets and proprietary information or to enforce its patent rights and copyrights and it is possible that in the future the companys competitors may be able to obtain the companys trade secrets or to independently develop similar unpatented technology 

the software development industry is characterized by rapid technological change therefore the company believes that factors such as the technological and creative skills of its personnel new product developments frequent product enhancements name recognition and reliable product maintenance are also important to establishing and maintaining technology leadership in addition to the various legal protections of its technology that may be available 

the company does not believe that any of its products infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties there can be no assurance however that third parties will not claim such infringement by the company or its licensors or licensees with respect to current or future products the company expects that software suppliers will increasingly be subject to the risk of such claims as the number of products and suppliers continues to expand and the functionality of products continues to increase any such claims with or without merit could be time consuming result in costly litigation cause product release delays or require the company to enter into royalty or licensing agreements such royalty or licensing agreements if required may not be available on terms acceptable to the company 

seasonal variations 

the companys business has experienced seasonality including quarterly reductions in software sales resulting from slowdowns of customer activities during the summer months particularly in europe as well as from the seasonal purchasing and budgeting patterns of the companys global customers lease and maintenance contract renewals are typically highest in the first and fourth quarters the companys revenue is typically highest in the fourth quarter 

deferred revenue and backlog 

deferred revenue consists of billings made or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from software license and maintenance agreements the deferred revenue on the companys consolidated balance sheets does not represent the total value of annual or multiyear noncancellable software license and maintenance agreements the companys backlog represents installment billings for periods beyond the current quarterly billing cycle and custom er orders received but not processed the companys deferred revenue and backlog as of december 31 2017  and 2016  consisted of the following 





revenue associated with deferred revenue and backlog that will be recognized in the subsequent twelve months is classified as current in the table above 

employees 

as of december 31 2017  the company employed approximately 2900  people at that date there were also contract personnel and coop students providing ongoing development services and technical support certain employees of the company are subject to collective bargaining agreements and have local work councils 

acquisitions 

the company makes targeted acquisitions in order to support its longterm strategic direction accelerate innovation provide increased capabilities to its existing products supply new products and services expand its customer base and enhance its distribution channels 

during the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015 the company completed various acquisitions to expand its customer base and accelerate the development of new and innovative products to the marketplace while lowering design and engineering costs for customers the acquisitions were not individually significant the combined purchase prices of the acquisitions purchased during the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015 were approximately 670 million  103 million  and 497 million respectively the 2017 technology acquisitions are further described in the table below

risk factors 

tableend information provided by the company or its spokespersons including information contained in this annual report on form 10k may from time to time contain forwardlooking statements concerning projected financial performance market and industry sector growth product development and commercialization or other aspects of future operations such statements will be based on the assumptions and expectations of the companys management at the time such statements are made the company cautions investors that its performance and therefore any forwardlooking statement is subject to risks and uncertainties various important factors including but not limited to the following may cause the companys future results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statement 

global economic conditions   the companys operations and performance depend significantly on foreign and domestic economic conditions uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment as well as geopolitical conditions can result in significant volatility in credit equity and foreign exchange markets this volatility and the related economic conditions may negatively impact the company as customers defer spending in response to tighter credit higher unemployment financial market volatility government austerity programs negative financial news declining valuations of investments and other factors in addition certain of the companys customers budgets may be constrained and they may be unable to purchase the companys products at the same level as they have in prior periods customer spending levels may be impacted by decreased government spending in certain countries as concerns continue regarding economic conditions and government debt levels these economic conditions can change abruptly to the extent the global economy experiences volatility the company may be exposed to impairments of certain assets as their values deteriorate 

tighter credit due to economic conditions may diminish the companys future borrowing ability the companys customers ability to pay for the companys products and services may also be impaired which may lead to an increase in the companys allowance for doubtful accounts and writeoffs of accounts receivable since the company is exposed to the majority of major world markets uncertainty in any significant market may negatively impact the companys performance and results particularly with respect to the companys largest geographic customer bases the company is unable to predict the likely duration and magnitude of changing economic conditions or the likelihood of additional uncertainty arising in any of the companys key markets adverse economic conditions could negatively impact the companys operating results cash flows and financial condition 

decline in customers businesses   the companys sales are based significantly on enduser demand for products in key industrial sectors many of these sectors periodically experience economic declines which may be exacerbated by other economic factors these factors may also adversely affect the companys business by extending sales cycles and reducing revenue these economic factors may cause the companys customers to reduce the size of their workforce or cut back on operations and may lead to a reduction in renewals of licenses or maintenance contracts with the company the companys customers may request discounts or extended payment terms on new products or seek to extend payment terms on existing contracts all of which may cause fluctuations in the companys future operating results the company may not be able to adjust its operating expenses to offset such fluctuations because a substantial portion of the companys operating expenses are related to personnel facilities and marketing programs the level of personnel and related expenses may not be able to be adjusted quickly and is based in significant part on the companys expectation for future revenue 

risks associated with international activities a majority of the companys business comes from outside the united states and the company has customers that supply a wide spectrum of goods and services in virtually all of the worlds major economic regions if any of the foreign economies in which the company does business deteriorate or suffer periods of uncertainty the companys business and performance may be negatively impacted through reduced customer spending changes in purchasing cycles or timing reduced access to credit for its customers or other factors impacting the companys international sales and collections the companys results may also be negatively impacted by geopolitical tensions which may result in increased economic volatility 

as a result of its significant international presence the company has revenue expenses cash accounts receivable and payment obligations denominated in foreign currencies as a result the company is subject to currency exchange risk the companys revenues and operating results are adversely affected when the us dollar strengthens relative to other currencies and are positively affected when the us dollar weakens as a result changes in currency exchange rates will affect the companys financial position results of operations and cash flows in the event that there are economic declines in countries in which the company conducts transactions the resulting changes in currency exchange rates may affect the companys financial position results of operations and cash flows the company is most impacted by movements in and among the euro japanese yen south korean won british pound taiwan dollar indian rupee and us dollar the company seeks to reduce currency exchange transaction risks primarily through its normal operating and treasury activities but there can be no assurance that it will be successful in reducing these risks 

in june 2016 the united kingdom voted to leave the european union the longterm impact of the decision is uncertain as a result the companys business in the united kingdom and europe could be adversely impacted due to political and economic instability fluctuations in currency exchange rates changes in laws and regulations and other factors these risks could negatively impact the companys financial position results of operations and cash flows 

in may 2018 a new set of data protection rules will go into effect in the european union these rules provide a unified and comprehensive set of requirements for data protection of individuals within the european union the company will be subject to these requirements which include potentially significant monetary penalties for noncompliance if the company fails to comply with the new regulations its reputation may suffer and its financial position results of operations and cash flows may be negatively impacted 

additional risks inherent in the companys international business activities include imposition of government controls export license requirements restrictions on the export of critical technology products and services the violation of anticorruption laws and regulations which are applicable to the company by third parties in countries where such conduct may be permissible or commonplace political and economic instability protectionist economic policies changes in tariffs and taxes difficulties in staffing and managing international operations changes in data privacy regulations longer accounts receivable payment cycles and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations effective patent copyright trademark and trade secret protection may not be available in every foreign country in which the company sells its products and services the companys business financial position results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks 

sales forecasts  the company makes many operational and strategic decisions based upon short and longterm sales forecasts the companys sales personnel continually monitor the status of all proposals including the estimated closing date and the value of the sale in order to forecast quarterly sales these forecasts are subject to significant estimation and are impacted by many external factors including global economic conditions and the performance of the companys customers a variation in actual sales activity from that forecasted could cause the company to plan or budget incorrectly and therefore could adversely affect the companys business financial position results of operations and cash flows the companys management team forecasts macroeconomic trends and developments and integrates them through longrange planning into budgets research and development strategies and a wide variety of general management duties global economic conditions and the effect those conditions and other disruptions in global markets have on the companys customers may have a significant impact on the accuracy of the companys sales forecasts these conditions may increase the likelihood or the magnitude of variations between actual sales activity and the companys sales forecasts and as a result the companys performance may be hindered because of a failure to properly match corporate strategy with economic conditions this in turn may adversely affect the companys business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

stock market and stock price volatility  market prices for securities of software companies have generally been volatile in particular the market price of the companys common stock has been and may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations as a result of factors affecting the company the software industry or the securities markets in general such factors include but are not limited to declines in trading price that may be triggered by the companys failure to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors moreover the trading price could be subject to additional fluctuations in response to quartertoquarter variations in the companys operating results material announcements made by the company or its competitors conditions in the financial markets or the software industry generally or other events and factors many of which are beyond the companys control 

rapidly changing technology new products risk of product errors the company operates in an industry generally characterized by rapidly changing technology and frequent new product introductions which can render existing products obsolete or unmarketable a major factor in the companys future success will be its ability to anticipate technological changes and to develop and introduce in a timely manner enhancements to its existing products products acquired in acquisitions and new products to meet those changes if the company is unable to introduce new products and to respond quickly to industry changes its business financial position results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

the introduction and marketing of new or enhanced products require the company to manage the transition from existing products in order to minimize disruption in customer purchasing patterns there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing and marketing on a timely basis new products or product enhancements that the new products will adequately address the changing needs of the marketplace or that the company will successfully manage the transition from existing products software products as complex as those offered by the company may contain undetected errors when first introduced or as new versions are released and the likelihood of errors is increased as a result of the companys commitment to the frequency of its product releases there can be no assurance that errors will not be found in any new or enhanced products after the commencement of commercial shipments certain products require a higher level of sales and support expertise failure of the companys sales channel particularly the indirect channel to obtain this expertise and to sell the new product offerings effectively could have an adverse impact on the companys sales in future periods any of these problems may result in the loss of or delay in customer acceptance diversion of development resources damage to the companys reputation or increased service and warranty costs any of which could have a material adverse effect on the companys business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

product quality the company has separate quality systems and registrations under the iso 90012008 standard in addition to other governmental and industrial regulations the companys continued compliance with quality standards and favorable outcomes in periodic examinations is important to retain current customers and vital to procure new sales if the company was determined not to be compliant with various regulatory or iso 90019000 standards its certificates of registration could be suspended requiring remedial action and a timeconsuming reregistration process product quality issues or failures could result in the companys reputation becoming diminished resulting in a material adverse impact on revenue operating margins net income financial position and cash flows 

competition  the company continues to experience competition across all markets for its products and services some of the companys current and possible future competitors have greater financial technical marketing and other resources than the company and some have wellestablished relationships with current and potential customers of the company the companys current and possible future competitors also include firms that have competed or may in the future elect to compete by means of open source licensing parties among the companys current or future strategic alliances may diminish or sever technical software development and marketing relationships with the company for competitive purposes these competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes price reductions andor increased operating costs and could result in lower revenues margins and net income 

changes in the companys pricing models the intense competition the company faces in the sales of its products and services and general economic and business conditions can put pressure on the company to adjust its prices if the companys competitors offer deep discounts on certain products or services or develop products that the marketplace considers more valuable the company may need to lower prices or offer discounts or other favorable terms in order to compete successfully any such changes may reduce operating margins and could adversely affect operating results the companys maintenance products which include software license updates and product support fees are generally priced as a percentage of its new software license fees the companys competitors may offer lower percentage pricing on product updates and support that could put pressure on the company to further discount its new license or product support prices 

any broadbased change to the companys prices and pricing policies could cause new software license and service revenues to decline or be delayed as its sales force implements and its customers adjust to the new pricing policies some of the companys competitors may bundle software products for promotional purposes or as a longterm pricing strategy or provide guarantees of prices product implementations or wider geographical license usage provisions these practices could over time significantly constrain the prices that the company can charge for certain products if the company does not adapt its pricing models to reflect changes in customer use of its products or changes in customer demand the companys new software license revenues could decrease additionally increased distribution of applications through application service providers including softwareasaservice providers may reduce the average price for the companys products or adversely affect other sales of the companys products reducing new software license revenues unless the company can offset price reductions with volume increases the increase in open source software distribution may also cause the company to adjust its pricing models 

dependence on senior management and key technical personnel  the companys success depends upon the continued services of the companys senior executives key technical employees and other employees each of the companys executive officers key technical personnel and other employees could terminate his or her relationship with the company at any time the loss of any of the companys senior executives might significantly delay or prevent the achievement of the companys business objectives and could materially harm the companys business and customer relationships 

in addition because of the highly technical nature of the companys products the company must attract and retain highly skilled engineering and development personnel many of whom are recruited from outside of the united states the market for this talent is highly competitive the company is limited in its ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws if the immigration laws become stricter or if the company has less success in recruiting and retaining key personnel the companys business reputation and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 

dependence on proprietary technology  the companys success is highly dependent upon its proprietary technology the company generally relies on contracts and the laws of copyrights patents trademarks and trade secrets to protect its technology the company maintains a trade secrets program enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees and channel partners and limits access to and distribution of its software documentation and other proprietary information there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company to protect its proprietary technology will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of its technology by third parties or that third parties will not be able to develop similar technology independently costly and timeconsuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of trade secret rights and related confidentiality and nondisclosure provisions although the company is not aware that any of its technology infringes upon the rights of third parties there can be no assurance that other parties will not assert technology infringement claims against the company or that if asserted such claims will not prevail 

risks associated with security of the companys products source code and it systems the company makes significant efforts to maintain and improve the security and integrity of its products source code computer systems and data despite significant efforts to create security barriers to such programs it is virtually impossible for the company to entirely mitigate this risk there appears to be an increasing number of computer “hackers” developing and deploying a variety of destructive software programs such as viruses worms and the like that could attack the companys products and computer systems as a result the company may incur costs to increase personnel and technology to prevent such attacks because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to networks or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target the company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures like all software products the companys software is vulnerable to such attacks the impact of such an attack could disrupt the proper functioning of the companys software products cause errors in the output of its customers work allow unauthorized access to sensitive proprietary or confidential information of the company or its customers and result in other destructive outcomes if this were to occur the companys reputation may suffer customers may stop buying products the company could face lawsuits and potential liability and the companys financial performance could be negatively impacted 

there is also a danger of industrial espionage cyberattacks misuse theft of information or assets including source code or damage to assets by people who have gained unauthorized access to the companys facilities systems or information this includes phishing which has become a very prevalent technique such cybersecurity breaches misuse or other disruptions could lead to the disclosure of portions of the companys product source code or other confidential information improper usage and distribution of the companys products without compensation illegal usage of the companys products which could jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through its computer systems and theft manipulation and destruction of private and proprietary data resulting in defective products and production downtimes although the company actively employs measures to combat unlicensed copying access and use of software and intellectual property through a variety of techniques preventing unauthorized use or infringement of the companys rights is inherently difficult these events could adversely affect the companys financial results or could result in significant claims for damages against it participating in lawsuits to protect against any such unauthorized access to usage of or disclosure of any of the companys products or any portion of the companys product source code or in prosecutions in connection with any such cybersecurity breach could be costly and timeconsuming and may divert managements attention and adversely affect the markets perception of the company and its products 

policing the unauthorized distribution and use of the companys products is difficult and software piracy including online piracy is a persistent problem the proliferation of technology designed to circumvent typical software protection measures used in the companys products and the possibility of methods that circumvent the techniques it employs in its products may lead to an expansion in piracy or misuse of its products and intellectual property as a result and despite the companys efforts to prevent such activities and to prosecute instances of such activities the company may nonetheless lose significant revenue due to illegal use of its software and managements attention may be diverted to address specific instances of piracy or misuse or to address piracy and misuse in general 

a number of the companys core processes such as software development sales and marketing customer service and financial transactions rely on its it infrastructure and applications the company also relies upon thirdparty products which are exposed to various security vulnerabilities malicious software sabotage and other cybersecurity breaches of the types discussed above could cause an outage of the companys infrastructure which could lead to a substantial denial of service and ultimately to production downtime recovery costs and customer claims this could have a significant negative impact on the companys business financial position profit and cash flows 

the company has implemented a number of measures designed to ensure the security of its information it resources and other assets nonetheless unauthorized users could gain access to its systems through cyberattacks and steal use without authorization and sabotage the companys intellectual property and confidential data any breach of its it security misuse or theft could lead to loss of production recovery costs or litigation brought by employees customers or business partners which could have a significant negative impact on the companys business financial position profit cash flows and reputation 

implementation of it systems  the company is currently implementing a new customer relationship management crm system while this system is anticipated to simplify the sales and order processing efforts and to enhance customer service there is a risk that the project will not achieve the anticipated benefits or that the benefits will not be achieved as quickly as anticipated there is also a risk that the company will have to write off previously capitalized expenditures if the project is not successful or if implementation decisions regarding the project are modified the project implementation timeline and scope may change and become longer and broader as new facets of the design and implementation efforts are undertaken this may take the attention of key operational management away from other aspects of the business including the integration of acquisitions and also result in increased consulting and software costs these factors may have a significant negative impact on the companys business financial position profit cash flows and reputation 

dependence on channel partners  the company continues to distribute a meaningful portion of its products through its global network of independent regional channel partners the channel partners sell the companys software products to new and existing customers expand installations within the existing customer base offer consulting services and provide the first line of technical support consequently in certain geographies the company is highly dependent upon the efforts of the channel partners difficulties in ongoing relationships with channel partners such as failure to meet performance criteria or to promote the companys products as aggressively as the company expects and differences in the handling of customer relationships could adversely affect the companys performance additionally the loss of any major channel partner for any reason including a channel partners decision to sell competing products rather than the companys products could have a material adverse effect on the company moreover the companys future success will depend substantially on the ability and willingness of its channel partners to continue to dedicate the resources necessary to promote the companys portfolio of products and to support a larger installed base of the companys products if the channel partners are unable or unwilling to do so the company may be unable to sustain revenue growth 

the company has been increasing its number of channel partners particularly in international locations the business relationships with these channel partners are recently established and could result in additional compliance burdens for the company these partners also have a lessestablished payment history with the company and revenue from these partners could come with a higher rate of bad debt expense 

during times of significant fluctuations in world currencies certain channel partners may have solvency issues to the extent that effective hedge strategies are not employed or there is not sufficient working capital in particular if the us dollar strengthens relative to other currencies certain channel partners who pay the company in us dollars may have trouble paying the company on time or may have trouble distributing the companys products due to the impact of the currency exchange fluctuation on such channel partners cash flows this may impact the companys ability to distribute its products into certain regions and markets and may have an adverse effect on the companys results of operations and cash flows 

reliance on perpetual licenses  although the company has historically maintained stable recurring revenue from the sale of software lease licenses and software maintenance subscriptions it also has relied on sales of perpetual licenses that involve the payment of a single upfront fee historically these licenses have been more typical in the computer software industry and remain as the preferred licensing approach in certain markets while revenue generated from software lease licenses and software maintenance subscriptions currently represents a portion of the companys revenue to the extent that perpetual license revenue continues to represent a significant percentage of total revenue the companys revenue in any period will depend significantly on sales completed during that period if customer purchasing patterns shift toward a stronger preference for lease licenses and fewer perpetual licenses as the company has recently experienced there could be a shortterm adverse impact on the companys revenue and profitability 

renewal rates for annual lease and maintenance contracts a substantial portion of the companys license and maintenance revenue is derived from annual lease and maintenance contracts these contracts are generally renewed on an annual basis and typically have a high rate of customer renewal in addition to the recurring revenue base associated with these contracts a majority of customers purchasing new perpetual licenses also purchase related annual maintenance contracts if the rate of renewal for these contracts is adversely affected by economic or other factors the companys license and maintenance growth will be adversely affected over the term that the revenue for those contracts would have otherwise been recognized as a result the companys business financial position results of operations and cash flows may also be adversely impacted during those periods 

risks associated with acquisitions historically the company has consummated acquisitions in order to support the companys longterm strategic direction accelerate innovation provide increased capabilities to existing products supply new products and services expand its customer base and enhance its distribution channels the company has completed a number of acquisitions in recent years and expects to make additional acquisitions in the future but may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or if suitable candidates are identified the company may not be able to complete the business combination on commercially acceptable terms the process of exploring and pursuing acquisition opportunities may result in devotion of significant management and financial resources 

even if the company is able to consummate acquisitions that it believes will be successful such transactions present many risks including among others difficulty in integrating the management teams strategies cultures and operations of the companies failing to achieve anticipated synergies and revenue increases difficulty incorporating and integrating the acquired technologies or products with the companys existing product lines difficulty in coordinating establishing or expanding sales distribution and marketing functions as necessary difficulty in training the global sales team to sell the acquired products failure to develop new products and services that utilize the technologies and resources of the companies disruption of the companys ongoing business and diversion of managements attention to transition or integration issues unanticipated and unknown liabilities the loss of key employees customers partners and channel partners of the company or of the acquired company resulting in the loss of key information expertise or knowhow and unanticipated additional recruitment and training costs infringement of intellectual property rights and difficulties implementing and maintaining sufficient controls policies and procedures over the systems products and processes of the acquired company if the company does not achieve the anticipated benefits of its acquisitions as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by the companys management and financial or industry analysts there could be a material adverse effect on the companys stock price business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

in addition for companies acquired limited experience will exist for several quarters following the acquisition relating to how the acquired companys sales pipelines will convert into sales or revenues and the conversion rate postacquisition may be quite different than the historical conversion rate because a substantial portion of the companys sales are completed in the latter part of a quarter and its cost structure is largely fixed in the shortterm revenue shortfalls may have a negative impact on the companys profitability a delay in a small number of large new software license transactions could cause the companys quarterly software license revenues to fall significantly short of its predictions 

the company may periodically be involved in business combinations with enterprises that are developmental in nature while these entities have leadingedge technology they may not have developed direct or indirect distribution channels and may not have software revenues which cover the ongoing expenses therefore the company may have a decrease in operating margin and profitability while these types of acquisitions are integrated and the distribution channel incorporates the new product offerings 

disruption of operations or infrastructure failures  a significant portion of the companys software development personnel source code and computer equipment is located at operating facilities in the united states canada india japan and throughout europe the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unforeseen catastrophe at any of these facilities could cause interruptions in the companys operations services and product development activities additionally if the company experiences problems that impair its business infrastructure such as a computer virus telephone system failure or an intentional disruption of its information technology systems by a third party these interruptions could have a material adverse effect on the companys business financial position results of operations cash flows and the ability to meet financial reporting deadlines further because the companys sales are not generally linear during any quarterly period the potential adverse effects resulting from any of the events described above or any other disruption of the companys business could be accentuated if it occurs close to the end of a fiscal quarter 

risks associated with significant sales to existing customers  a significant portion of the companys sales includes followon sales to existing customers that invest in the companys broad suite of engineering simulation software and services if a significant number of current customers were to become dissatisfied with the companys products and services or choose to license or utilize competitive offerings the companys followon sales and recurring lease and maintenance revenues could be materially adversely impacted resulting in reduced revenue operating margins net income and cash flows 

industry consolidation  consolidation in industries that utilize the company’s software may result in combined workforces 

where economies of scale and synergies are achieved and fewer ansys software licenses are required consolidation may 

also result in the newly combinedsurviving entity wanting the most favorable pricing from the former contracts and expecting 

larger volume discounts on future purchases if a customer is acquired by an entity that does not utilize ansys in favor of a competing product the company may not have future orders from the enterprise further consolidation of the companys competitors may result in synergies that allow those competitors to benefit from broader sales channels and increased access to capital any of these impacts could adversely affect the companys business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

periodic reorganization of sales force  the company relies heavily on its direct sales force from time to time the company reorganizes and makes adjustments to its sales leadership andor its sales force in response to such factors as management changes performance issues market opportunities and other considerations these changes may result in a temporary lack of sales production and may adversely impact revenue in future quarters there can be no assurance that the company will not restructure its sales force in future periods or that the transition issues associated with such a restructuring will not occur 

regulatory compliance  like all other public companies the company is subject to the rules and regulations of the sec including those that require the company to report on and receive an attestation from its independent registered public accounting firm regarding the companys internal control over financial reporting compliance with these requirements causes the company to incur additional expenses and causes management to divert time from the daytoday operations of the company while the company anticipates being able to fully comply with these requirements if it is not able to comply with the reporting or attestation requirements relating to internal control over financial reporting the company may be subject to sanctions by the sec or nasdaq such sanctions could divert the attention of the companys management from implementing its business plan and could have an adverse effect on the companys business and results of operations 

as the companys stock is listed on the nasdaq global select market the company is subject to the ongoing financial and corporate governance requirements of nasdaq while the company anticipates being able to fully comply with these requirements if it is not able to comply the companys name may be published on nasdaqs daily noncompliant companies list until nasdaq determines that it has regained compliance or the company no longer trades on nasdaq if the company was unable to return to compliance with the governance requirements of nasdaq the company may be delisted from the nasdaq global select market which could have an adverse effect on the market value of the companys equity securities and the ability to raise additional capital 

governmental revenue sources the companys sales to the united states government must comply with federal acquisition regulations failure to comply with these regulations could result in penalties being assessed against the company or an order preventing the company from making future sales to the united states government further the companys international activities must comply with the export control laws of the united states and other countries the foreign corrupt practices act the united kingdom bribery act of 2010 and a variety of other laws and regulations of the united states and other countries in 

which the company operates failure to comply with any of these laws and regulations could adversely affect the companys business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

in certain circumstances the united states government state and local governments and their respective agencies and certain foreign governments may have the right to terminate contractual arrangements at any time without cause the united states european union and certain other government contracts as well as the companys state and local level contracts are subject to the approval of appropriations or funding authorizations certain of these contracts permit the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions including but not limited to termination of contracts refund of a portion of fees received forfeiture of profits suspension of payments fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business any of which could have an adverse effect on the companys results of operations and cash flows 

contingencies  the company is subject to various investigations claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business including commercial disputes labor and employment matters tax audits alleged infringement of intellectual property rights and other matters each of these matters is subject to various uncertainties and it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could materially affect the companys results of operations cash flows and financial position 

income tax estimates  the company makes significant estimates in determining its worldwide income tax provision these estimates involve complex tax regulations in a number of jurisdictions across the companys global operations and are subject to many transactions and calculations in which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain the final outcome of tax matters could be different than the estimates reflected in the historical income tax provision and related accruals such differences could have a material impact on income tax expense and net income in the periods in which such determinations are made 

the amount of income tax paid by the company is subject to ongoing audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities these audits can result in additional assessments including interest and penalties the companys estimate for liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions is highly judgmental and actual future outcomes may result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to the companys estimated tax liabilities including estimates for uncertain tax positions in the period the assessments are made or resolved audits are closed or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire as a result the companys effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly or annual basis 

the company allocates a portion of its purchase price to goodwill and intangible assets impairment charges associated with goodwill are generally not taxdeductible and will result in an increased effective income tax rate in the period the impairment is recorded the company has recorded significant deferred tax liabilities related to acquired intangible assets that are not deductible for tax purposes these deferred tax liabilities are based on future statutory tax rates in the locations in which the intangible assets are recorded any future changes in statutory tax rates would be recorded as an adjustment to the deferred tax liabilities in the period the change is announced and could have a material impact on the companys effective tax rate during that period 

changes in tax law the companys operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions a change in the tax law in the jurisdictions in which the company does business including an increase in tax rates an adverse change in the treatment of an item of income or expense or a decrease in tax rates in a jurisdiction in which the company has significant deferred tax assets could result in a material increase in tax expense currently a substantial portion of the companys revenue is generated from customers located outside the united states and a substantial portion of assets are located outside the united states changes in existing taxation rules or practices new taxation rules or varying interpretations of current taxation practices could have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations or the manner in which the company conducts its business 

the us governments enactment of comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act could cause management to divert time from the daytoday operations of the company which could impact the companys business if the company is unable to successfully transition its business systems processes and internal controls it could impact the ability to meet financial reporting deadlines 

the company has significant operations in india there have been court rulings concerning certain indian tax laws that have been inconsistent with tax positions taken by the company and inconsistent with the advice provided to the company by its tax advisors 

an indian subsidiary of the company has several service tax audits pending that have resulted in formal inquiries being received on transactions through mid2012 the company could incur tax charges and related liabilities of approximately 75 million  the service tax issues raised in the company’s notices and inquiries are very similar to the case ms microsoft corporation i p ltd vs commissioner of service tax new delhi wherein the delhi customs excise and service tax appellate tribunal cestat has passed a favorable ruling to microsoft the company can provide no assurances on whether the microsoft case’s favorable ruling will be challenged in higher courts or on the impact that the present microsoft case’s decision will have on the company’s cases the company is uncertain as to when these service tax matters will be concluded 

other court cases are pending in india that could have a material impact on the companys financial position results of operations and cash flows if the ultimate outcome of those cases is similarly inconsistent with tax positions taken by the company 

a french subsidiary of the company previously received notice that the french taxing authority rejected the companys 2012 research and development credit the company contested the decision and received a favorable outcome during the first half of 2017 there are currently no challenges to other years research and development credits for this subsidiary however other years are subject to future review and audit 

changes in existing financial accounting standards changes in existing accounting rules or practices new accounting pronouncements or varying interpretations of current accounting pronouncements could have a significant adverse effect on the companys results of operations or the manner in which the company conducts its business 

in addition the company could incur significant costs for changes to its business systems processes and internal controls as a result of the transition these costs could have a significant adverse impact on the companys results of operations and cash flows the transition could also cause management to divert time from the daytoday operations of the company which could impact the companys business if the company is unable to successfully transition its business systems processes and internal controls before the guidance effective date it could impact the ability to meet financial reporting deadlines for further information on the impact of recently issued accounting guidance on the company see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k

results of operations 

for purposes of the following discussion and analysis the table below sets forth certain consolidated financial data for the years 2017  2016  and 2015  the operating results of the companys acquisitions have been included in the results of operations since their respective acquisition dates 



year ended december 31 2017  compared to year ended december 31 2016 

revenue 



the companys revenue increased 108   103  in constant currency during the year ended december 31 2017  as compared to the year ended december 31 2016  the growth rate was favorably impacted by the companys continued investment in its global sales support and marketing organizations lease license revenue increased 107  as compared to the prior year perpetual license revenue which is derived primarily from new sales increased 89  as compared to the prior year annual maintenance contracts that were sold with new perpetual licenses along with maintenance contracts sold with new perpetual licenses in previous years contributed to maintenance revenue growth of 116  service revenue primarily composed of consulting projects increased 169 

with respect to revenue on average for the year ended december 31 2017  the us dollar was 10  weaker when measured against the companys primary foreign currencies than for the year ended december 31 2016  the table below presents the impacts of currency fluctuations on revenue for the year ended december 31 2017 amounts in brackets indicate a net adverse impact from currency fluctuations 



the weaker us dollar also resulted in increased operating income of 35 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  as compared to the year ended december 31 2016  

a substantial portion of the companys license and maintenance revenue is derived from annual lease and maintenance contracts these contracts are generally renewed on an annual basis and typically have a high rate of customer renewal in addition to the recurring revenue base associated with these contracts a majority of customers purchasing new perpetual licenses also purchase related annual maintenance contracts as a result of the significant recurring revenue base the companys license and maintenance revenue growth rate in any period does not necessarily correlate to the growth rate of new license and maintenance contracts sold during that period to the extent the rate of customer renewal for lease and maintenance contracts is high incremental lease contracts and maintenance contracts sold with new perpetual licenses will result in license and maintenance revenue growth in constant currency conversely if the rate of renewal for these contracts is adversely affected by economic or other factors the companys license and maintenance growth will be adversely affected over the term that the revenue for those contracts would have otherwise been recognized 

the company is starting to experience an increased interest by some of its larger customers in enterprise agreements that often include longerterm timebased licenses involving a larger number of the companys software products while these arrangements typically involve a higher overall transaction price the revenue from these contracts has been typically deferred 

under asc 605 and recognized over the period of the contract resulting in increased deferred revenue and backlog under asc 606 which is effective on january 1 2018 the license component of these arrangements will be recognized upfront resulting in increased volatility in the companys reporting of quarterly and annual revenue the company is similarly experiencing a shifting preference from perpetual licenses to timebased licenses across a broader spectrum of its customers particularly in the more mature geographic markets such as the us and japan to the extent this shift continues or becomes more prevalent the result could be a nearterm adverse impact on software license and maintenance revenue growth 

international and domestic revenues as a percentage of total revenue were 619  and 381  respectively during the year ended december 31 2017  and 628  and 372  respectively during the year ended december 31 2016  the company derived 248  and 244  of its total revenue through the indirect sales channel for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively 

in valuing deferred revenue on the balance sheets of the companys recent acquisitions as of their respective acquisition dates the company applied the fair value provisions applicable to the accounting for business combinations resulting in a reduction of deferred revenue as compared to its historical carrying amount as a result the companys postacquisition revenue will be less than the sum of what would have otherwise been reported by ansys and each acquiree absent the acquisitions the impacts on reported revenue for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  were 29 million  and 01 million  respectively 

cost of sales and gross profit 

the table below reflects the companys operating results as presented on the consolidated statements of income which are inclusive of foreign currency translation impacts amounts included in the discussion that follows are provided in constant currency the impact where material of foreign exchange translation on each expense line is provided separately 



software licenses  the increase in the cost of software licenses was primarily due to the following 

 amortization  the decrease in amortization expense was primarily due to a net decrease in the amortization of acquired technology partially offset by an increase in the amortization of trade names 

maintenance and service  the net decrease in maintenance and service costs was primarily due to the following 

 the improvement in gross profit was a result of the increase in revenue partially offset by the increase in the related cost of sales 

operating expenses 

the table below reflects the companys operating results as presented on the consolidated statements of income which are inclusive of foreign currency translation impacts amounts included in the discussion that follows are provided in constant currency the impact where material of foreign exchange translation on each expense line is provided separately 



selling general and administrative  the increase in selling general and administrative costs was primarily due to the following 

 the company anticipates that it will continue to make targeted investments in its global sales and marketing organizations and its global business infrastructure to enhance and support its revenuegenerating activities 

research and development  the increase in research and development costs was primarily due to the following 

 the company has traditionally invested significant resources in research and development activities and intends to continue to make investments in expanding the ease of use and capabilities of its broad portfolio of simulation software products 

interest income  interest income for the year ended december 31 2017  was 70 million  as compared to 42 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  interest income increased as a result of an increase in both the companys average invested cash balances and the average rate of return on those balances 

other expense net  the companys other expense consists of the following 



income tax provision  the company recorded income tax expense of 1364 million  and had income before income taxes of 3957 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  representing an effective tax rate of 345  during the year ended december 31 2016  the company recorded income tax expense of 1147 million  and had income before income taxes of 3803 million  representing an effective tax rate of 302  

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act tax reform tax reform makes broad and complex changes to the us tax code including but not limited to 1 reducing the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent 2 requiring companies to pay a onetime transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries transition tax 3 generally eliminating us federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries 4 creating a new provision designed to tax global intangible lowtaxed income gilti which allows for the possibility of using foreign tax credits ftcs and a deduction of up to 50 percent to offset the income tax liability subject to some limitations 5 repealing the domestic production activity deduction 6 creating the base erosion antiabuse tax a new minimum tax 7 allowing for full expensing of qualified property through bonus depreciation and 8 creating limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation 

the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin sab 118 which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of tax reform sab 118 provides a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from enactment for companies to complete the accounting under asc 740 income taxes  in accordance with sab 118 a company must reflect the income tax effects of those aspects of tax reform for which the accounting under asc 740 is complete in the financial statements to the extent that a company’s accounting for certain income tax effects of tax reform is incomplete but a reasonable estimate is able to be made the company must record a provisional estimate in the financial statements if a company cannot determine a provisional estimate to be included in the financial statements it should continue to apply asc 740 on the basis of the tax laws that were in effect immediately before the enactment of tax reform 

in connection with the company’s initial analysis of the impact of tax reform a discrete net tax expense of 179 million was recorded in the period ending december 31 2017 primarily consisting of 19 million for the revaluation of net deferred tax assets and 160 million for the transition tax in addition to the 179 million charge the company would have recognized a 48 million benefit in the fourth quarter related to foreign earnings repatriation but this benefit was eliminated due to tax reform as further discussed below the company was able to complete final or provisional calculations for certain elements of tax reform and the amounts and estimates are included in the financial statements for other elements the company was not able to make reasonable estimates and therefore those elements have not been recorded and are accounted for in accordance with asc 740 on the basis of the tax laws in effect before tax reform 

the company’s accounting for the impact of the reduction in the us federal corporate tax rate on the companys deferred tax assets and liabilities is complete tax reform reduces the corporate tax rate to 21 percent effective january 1 2018 consequently the company has recorded a net adjustment to deferred income tax expense of 19 million for the year ended december 31 2017 to revalue the company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities the lower statutory rate of 21 will have a favorable impact on the company’s effective tax rate in future years 

the company’s accounting for the transition tax is incomplete however reasonable estimates of certain effects were able to be calculated and therefore a provisional adjustment was recorded the transition tax is a tax on the deemed repatriation of previously untaxed accumulated current earnings and profits ep of certain foreign subsidiaries to determine the amount of the transition tax the company must determine in addition to other factors the amount of post1986 ep of the relevant subsidiaries as well as the amount of nonus income taxes paid on such earnings the company was able to make a reasonable estimate of the transition tax and recorded a provisional transition tax expense of 160 million however the company will continue to gather additional information to more precisely compute the final amount the company plans to elect to pay this liability over eight years and has recorded 145 million of the obligation in other longterm liabilities with the balance recorded to accrued income taxes 

the company’s accounting for the indefinite reinvestment assertion is incomplete however a reasonable estimate of book and tax basis was calculated and the company made a provisional assertion in general it is the practice and intention of the company to repatriate previously taxed earnings and to reinvest all other earnings of its nonus subsidiaries as part of tax reform the company incurred us tax on substantially all of the earnings of its nonus subsidiaries as part of the transition tax this tax increased the company’s previously taxed earnings and will allow for the repatriation of the majority of its foreign earnings without any residual us federal tax the company does not believe that there is an excess of the financial reporting basis over the tax basis of investments in foreign subsidiaries accordingly any repatriation in excess of previously taxed earnings will be a nontaxable return of basis this assertion is subject to change as additional information is gathered to precisely compute the book and tax basis of the company’s nonus subsidiaries 

the company’s accounting for gilti is incomplete and reasonable estimates of the effects are not able to be made therefore no provisional adjustments were recorded tax reform creates a new requirement that gilti earned by controlled foreign corporations cfcs must be included currently in the gross income of the cfcs’ us shareholder gilti is the excess of the shareholder’s “net cfc tested income” over the net deemed tangible income return which is currently defined as the excess of 1 10 percent of the aggregate of the us shareholder’s pro rata share of the qualified business asset investment of each cfc over 2 the amount of certain interest expense taken into account in the determination of net cfctested income 

due to the complexity of the new gilti tax rules the company is continuing to evaluate this provision of tax reform and the application of asc 740 under us gaap the company is allowed to make an accounting policy choice of either 1 treating taxes due on future us inclusions in taxable income related to gilti as a currentperiod expense when incurred the “period cost method” or 2 factoring such amounts into the company’s measurement of its deferred taxes the “deferred method” the company’s selection of an accounting policy with respect to the new gilti tax rules will depend in part on analyzing global income to determine whether future us inclusions in taxable income related to gilti are expected and if so the expected impact whether the company expects to have future us inclusions in taxable income related to gilti depends not only on the current structure and estimated future results of global operations but also on the company’s intent and ability to modify the structure andor the business the company is not yet able to reasonably estimate the effect of this provision of tax reform and therefore has not made any adjustments related to potential gilti tax in the financial statements in addition the company has not made the accounting policy decision regarding whether to record deferred taxes on gilti or expense taxes as incurred on gilti 

the increase in the effective tax rate from the prior year is primarily due to tax charges of 179 million related to tax reform partially offset by increased tax benefits of 131 million  related to stockbased compensation in 2017 in addition the 2016 effective tax rate was reduced by entity structuring and related repatriation benefits of 108 million  that did not recur in 2017 in the first quarter of 2017 the company adopted asu 201609 compensation  stock compensation topic 718 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting  which requires excess tax benefits and deficiencies related to stockbased compensation to be reflected in the income statement as a component of the provision for income taxes previously these tax effects were reflected in stockholders equity 

when compared to the federal and state combined statutory rate the effective tax rates for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 were favorably impacted by the domestic manufacturing deduction and research and development credits the rates were also favorably impacted by the recurring item of lower statutory tax rates in many of the companys foreign jurisdictions 

net income  the companys net income for the year ended december 31 2017  was 2593 million  as compared to net income of 2656 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  diluted earnings per share was 298  for the year ended december 31 2017  and 299  for the year ended december 31 2016  the weighted average shares used in computing diluted earnings per share were 869 million  and 890 million  for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively 

year ended december 31 2016 compared to year ended december 31 2015 

revenue 



the companys revenue increased 48 during the year ended december 31 2016 as compared to the year ended december 31 2015 while revenue grew 51 in constant currency the growth rate was favorably impacted by the companys continued investment in its global sales support and marketing organizations and was adversely impacted by a recent shift in the licensing preference of certain customers from perpetual licenses to lease licenses lease license revenue increased 76 as compared to the prior year perpetual license revenue which is derived primarily from new sales decreased 46 as compared to the prior year annual maintenance contracts that were sold with new perpetual licenses along with maintenance contracts sold with new perpetual licenses in previous years contributed to maintenance revenue growth of 83 

with respect to revenue on average for the year ended december 31 2016 the us dollar was 05 stronger when measured against the companys primary foreign currencies than for the year ended december 31 2015 the table below presents the impacts of currency fluctuations on revenue for the year ended december 31 2016 amounts in brackets indicate a net adverse impact from currency fluctuations 

the net overall stronger us dollar also resulted in increased operating income of 09 million during the year ended december 31 2016 as compared to the year ended december 31 2015 

international and domestic revenues as a percentage of total revenue were 628 and 372 respectively during the year ended december 31 2016 and 624 and 376 respectively during the year ended december 31 2015 the company derived 244 and 242 of its total revenue through the indirect sales channel for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively 

in valuing deferred revenue on the balance sheets of the companys acquisitions as of their respective acquisition dates the company applied the fair value provisions applicable to the accounting for business combinations resulting in a reduction of deferred revenue as compared to its historical carrying amount as a result the companys postacquisition revenue is less than the sum of what would have otherwise been reported by ansys and each acquiree absent the acquisitions the impacts on reported revenue for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 were 01 million and 17 million respectively 

cost of sales and gross profit 

the table below reflects the companys operating results as presented on the consolidated statements of income which are inclusive of foreign currency translation impacts amounts included in the discussion that follows are provided in constant currency the impact where material of foreign exchange translation on each expense line is provided separately 



software licenses  contributing to the minimal change in costs of software were the following two offsetting factors 

 amortization  the net decrease in amortization expense was primarily due to a net decrease in the amortization of acquired technology partially offset by a net increase in the amortization of trade names 

maintenance and service  the net increase in maintenance and service costs was primarily due to the following 

 the improvement in gross profit was a result of the increase in revenue and decrease in related cost of sales

the increase in the effective tax rate from the prior year is primarily due to tax benefits related to the merger of the companys japan subsidiaries in 2010 recognized in 2015 that did not recur in 2016 partially offset by tax benefits from restructuring activities in 2016 when compared to the federal and state combined statutory rate the effective tax rates for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 were favorably impacted by the domestic manufacturing deduction and research and development credits the quarterly benefit of approximately 31 million associated with the merger of the companys japan subsidiaries was fully amortized in the third quarter of 2015 there will be no additional ongoing benefit from this transaction the rates were also favorably impacted by the recurring item of lower statutory tax rates in many of the companys foreign jurisdictions

nongaap results 

the company provides nongaap revenue nongaap operating income nongaap operating profit margin nongaap net income and nongaap diluted earnings per share as supplemental measures to gaap regarding the companys operational performance these financial measures exclude the impact of certain items and therefore have not been calculated in accordance with gaap a detailed explanation and a reconciliation of each nongaap financial measure to its most comparable gaap financial measure are described below 

 



 nongaap measures 

management uses nongaap financial measures a to evaluate the companys historical and prospective financial performance as well as its performance relative to its competitors b to set internal sales targets and spending budgets c to allocate resources d to measure operational profitability and the accuracy of forecasting e to assess financial discipline over operational expenditures and f as an important factor in determining variable compensation for management and its employees in addition many financial analysts that follow the company focus on and publish both historical results and future projections based on nongaap financial measures the company believes that it is in the best interest of its investors to provide this information to analysts so that they accurately report the nongaap financial information moreover investors have historically requested and the company has historically reported these nongaap financial measures as a means of providing consistent and comparable information with past reports of financial results   

while management believes that these nongaap financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors there are limitations associated with the use of these nongaap financial measures these nongaap financial measures are not prepared in accordance with gaap are not reported by all of the companys competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of the companys competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation the company compensates for these limitations by using these nongaap financial measures as supplements to gaap financial measures and by reviewing the reconciliations of the nongaap financial measures to their most comparable gaap financial measures   

the adjustments to these nongaap financial measures and the basis for such adjustments are outlined below   

acquisition accounting for deferred revenue and its related tax impact historically the company has consummated acquisitions in order to support its strategic and other business objectives in accordance with the fair value provisions applicable to the accounting for business combinations acquired deferred revenue is often recorded on the opening balance sheet at an amount that is lower than the historical carrying value although this acquisition accounting requirement has no impact on the companys business or cash flow it adversely impacts the companys reported gaap revenue in the reporting periods following an acquisition in order to provide investors with financial information that facilitates comparison of both historical and future results the company provides nongaap financial measures which exclude the impact of the acquisition accounting adjustment the company believes that this nongaap financial adjustment is useful to investors because it allows investors to a evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in its financial and operational decisionmaking and b compare past and future reports of financial results of the company as the revenue reduction related to acquired deferred revenue will not recur when related annual lease licenses and software maintenance contracts are renewed in future periods   

amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions and its related tax impact the company incurs amortization of intangible assets included in its gaap presentation of amortization expense related to various acquisitions it has made management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating nongaap operating income nongaap operating profit margin nongaap net income and nongaap diluted earnings per share when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the company because these costs are fixed at the time of an acquisition are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition accordingly management does not consider these expenses for purposes of evaluating the performance of the company during the applicable time period after the acquisition and it excludes such expenses when making decisions to allocate resources the company believes that these nongaap financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to a evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in its financial and operational decisionmaking and b compare past reports of financial results of the company as the company has historically reported these nongaap financial measures   

stockbased compensation expense and its related tax impact  the company incurs expense related to stockbased compensation included in its gaap presentation of cost of software licenses cost of maintenance and service research and development expense and selling general and administrative expense stockbased compensation expense benefit incurred in connection with the companys deferred compensation plan held in a rabbi trust includes an offsetting benefit charge recorded in other income expense although stockbased compensation is an expense of the company and viewed as a form of compensation management excludes these expenses for the purpose of calculating nongaap operating income nongaap operating profit margin nongaap net income and nongaap diluted earnings per share when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the company management similarly excludes income expense related to assets held in a rabbi trust in connection with the companys deferred compensation plan specifically the company excludes stockbased compensation and income related to assets held in the deferred compensation plan rabbi trust during its annual budgeting process and its quarterly and annual assessments of the companys and managements performance the annual budgeting process is the primary mechanism whereby the company allocates resources to various initiatives and operational requirements additionally the annual review by the board of directors during which it compares the companys historical business model and profitability to the planned business model and profitability for the forthcoming year excludes the impact of stockbased compensation in evaluating the performance of senior management and department managers charges related to stockbased compensation are excluded from expenditure and profitability results in fact the company records stockbased compensation expense into a standalone cost center for which no single operational manager is responsible or accountable in this way management is able to review on a periodtoperiod basis each managers performance and assess financial discipline over operational expenditures without the effect of stockbased compensation the company believes that these nongaap financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to a evaluate the companys operating results and the effectiveness of the methodology used by management to review the companys operating results and b review historical comparability in the companys financial reporting as well as comparability with competitors operating results   

restructuring charges and the related tax impact  the company occasionally incurs expenses for restructuring its workforce included in its gaap presentation of cost of software licenses cost of maintenance and service research and development expense and selling general and administrative expense management excludes these expenses for the purpose of calculating nongaap operating income nongaap operating profit margin nongaap net income and nongaap diluted earnings per share when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the company as it generally does not incur these expenses as a part of its operations the company believes that these nongaap financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to a evaluate the companys operating results and the effectiveness of the methodology used by management to review the companys operating results and b review historical comparability in the companys financial reporting as well as comparability with competitors operating results   

transaction costs related to business combinations the company incurs expenses for professional services rendered in connection with business combinations which are included in its gaap presentation of research and development expense and selling general and administrative expense these expenses are generally not taxdeductible management excludes these acquisitionrelated transaction expenses derived from closed acquisitions for the purpose of calculating nongaap operating income nongaap operating profit margin nongaap net income and nongaap diluted earnings per share when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the company as it generally would not have otherwise incurred these expenses in the periods presented as a part of its operations the company believes that these nongaap financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to a evaluate the companys operating results and the effectiveness of the methodology used by management to review the companys operating results and b review historical comparability in the companys financial reporting as well as comparability with competitors operating results   

tax cuts and jobs act the company recorded charges in its income tax provision related to the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act including charges for the transition tax related to unrepatriated cash and the impacts of the tax rate change on net deferred tax assets in addition the company was not able to realize a tax benefit related to foreign earnings repatriation due to the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act management excludes these charges and the unrealized benefit for the purpose of calculating nongaap net income and nongaap diluted earnings per share when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the company as i the charges are not expected to recur as part of its normal operations and ii both the charges and unrealized tax benefit resulted from the extremely infrequent event of major us tax reform the last such reform having occurred in 1986 the company believes that these nongaap financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to a evaluate the companys operating results and the effectiveness of the methodology used by management to review the companys operating results and b review historical comparability in the companys financial reporting   

nongaap financial measures are not in accordance with or an alternative for gaap the companys nongaap financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable gaap financial measures and should be read only in conjunction with the companys consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap   

the company has provided a reconciliation of the nongaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures as listed below

the amount of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments held by foreign subsidiaries is subject to translation adjustments caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period the offset to which is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the companys consolidated balance sheet

contractual obligations 

the companys significant contractual obligations as of december 31 2017  are summarized below 





critical accounting policies and estimates 

the company believes that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition  revenue is derived principally from the licensing of computer software products and from related maintenance contracts revenue from perpetual licenses is classified as license revenue and is recognized upon delivery of the licensed product and the utility that enables the customer to access authorization keys provided that acceptance has occurred and a signed contractual obligation has been received the price is fixed and determinable and collectibility of the receivable is probable the company determines the fair value of postcontract customer support pcs sold together with perpetual licenses based on the rate charged for pcs when sold separately revenue from pcs contracts is classified as maintenance and service revenue and is recognized ratably over the term of the contract 

revenue for software lease licenses is classified as license revenue and is recognized over the period of the lease contract typically the companys software leases include pcs which due to the short term principally one year or less of the companys software lease licenses is not separated from lease revenue for accounting purposes both the lease licenses and pcs are recognized ratably over the lease period the company includes the revenue for the entire lease arrangement within software license revenue in the consolidated statements of income 

many of the companys semiconductor products are typically licensed via longer term leases of 24–36 months the company recognizes revenue for these licenses over the term of the lease contract because the company does not have vendorspecific objective evidence of the fair value of these leases the company also recognizes revenue from perpetual licenses over the term of the lease contract during the infrequent occurrence of these licenses being sold with semiconductor leases in multipleelement arrangements 

revenue from training support and other services is recognized as the services are performed the company applies the specific performance method to contracts in which the service consists of a single act such as providing a training class to a customer and the proportional performance method to other service contracts that are longer in duration and often include multiple acts for example both training and consulting in applying the proportional performance method the company typically utilizes outputbased estimates for services with contractual billing arrangements that are not based on time and materials and estimates output based on the total tasks completed as compared to the total tasks required for each work contract inputbased estimates are utilized for services that involve general consultations with contractual billing arrangements based on time and materials utilizing direct labor as the input measure 

the company also executes arrangements through independent channel partners in which the channel partners are authorized to market and distribute the companys software products to end users of the companys products and services in specified territories in sales facilitated by channel partners the channel partner bears the risk of collection from the enduser customer the company recognizes revenue from transactions with channel partners when the channel partner submits a written purchase commitment collectibility from the channel partner is probable a license agreement signed by the enduser customer is received and delivery has occurred provided that all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied revenue from channel partner transactions is the amount remitted to the company by the channel partners this amount includes a fee for pcs that is compensation for providing technical enhancements and the second level of technical support to the end user which is based on the rate charged for pcs when sold separately and is recognized over the period that pcs is to be provided the company does not offer right of return product rotation or price protection to any of its channel partners 

nonincomerelated taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as accounts receivable and accrued expenses the collection and payment of these amounts are reported on a net basis in the consolidated statements of income and do not impact reported revenues or expenses 

the company warrants to its customers that its software will substantially perform as specified in the companys current user manuals the company has not experienced significant claims related to software warranties beyond the scope of maintenance support which the company is already obligated to provide consequently the company has not established reserves for warranty obligations 

the companys agreements with its customers generally require it to indemnify the customer against claims that the companys software infringes thirdparty patent copyright trademark or other proprietary rights such indemnification obligations are generally limited in a variety of industrystandard respects including the companys right to replace an infringing product as of december 31 2017  the company had not experienced any losses related to these indemnification obligations and no claims with respect thereto were outstanding the company does not expect significant claims related to these indemnification obligations and consequently the company has not established any related reserves 

allowance for doubtful accounts  the company makes judgments as to its ability to collect outstanding receivables and provides allowances for a portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices from both value and delinquency perspectives for those invoices not specifically reviewed provisions are provided at differing rates based upon the age of the receivable and the geographic area of origin in determining these percentages the company considers its historical collection experience and current economic trends in the customers industry and geographic region if the historical data used to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and future results of operations could be materially affected 

income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period of the enactment date 

the company records net deferred tax assets to the extent it believes these assets will more likely than not be realized in making such determination the company considers all available positive and negative evidence including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and recent financial operations in the event the company determines that it will be able to realize deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance was used to reduce their carrying value the adjustment to the valuation allowance will be recorded as a reduction to the provision for income taxes 

tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a morelikelythannot threshold otherwise these tax benefits are recorded when a tax position has been effectively settled which means that the statute of limitations has expired or the appropriate taxing authority has completed their examination even though the statute of limitations remains open the company recognizes interest and penalties related to income taxes within the income tax expense line in the consolidated statements of income accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheets 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets the company tests goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment at least annually by performing a quantitative assessment of whether the fair value of each reporting unit or asset exceeds its carrying amount goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level and indefinitelived intangible assets are tested at the individual asset level this requires the company to assess and make judgments regarding a variety of factors which impact the fair value of the reporting unit or asset being tested including business plans anticipated future cash flows economic projections and other market data because there are inherent uncertainties involved in these factors significant differences between these estimates and actual results could result in future impairment charges and could materially impact the companys future financial results during the first quarter of 2017  the company completed the annual impairment test for goodwill and the indefinitelived intangible asset and determined that these assets had not been impaired as of the test date january 1 2017  no other events or circumstances changed during the year ended december 31 2017  that would indicate that the fair values of the companys reporting unit and indefinitelived intangible asset are below their carrying values 

contingencies   the company is involved in various investigations claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business including commercial disputes labor and employment matters tax audits alleged infringement of intellectual property rights and other matters the company reviews the status of these matters assesses its financial exposure and records a related accrual if the potential loss from an investigation claim or legal proceeding is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable significant judgment is involved in the determination of probability and in the determination of whether an exposure is reasonably estimable as a result of the uncertainties involved in making these estimates the company may have to revise its estimates as facts and circumstances change the revision of these estimates could have a material impact on the companys financial position and results of operations 

stockbased compensation the company grants restricted stock units and other stock awards to employees and directors under the companys stock option and grant plan eligible employees can also purchase shares of the companys common stock at a discount under the companys employee stock purchase plan the benefits provided under these plans are sharebased payments subject to the provisions of sharebased payment accounting guidance the company uses the fair value method to apply the provisions of sharebased payment accounting guidance stockbased compensation expense for 2017  2016  and 2015  was 532 million  333 million  and 340 million  respectively as of december 31 2017  total unrecognized estimated compensation expense related to unvested stock options and awards granted prior to that date was 1077 million  which is expected to be recognized over a weightedaverage period of 19 years  

the value of each stock option award was estimated on the date of grant or date of acquisition for options issued in a business combination using the blackscholes option pricing model blackscholes model the determination of the fair value of sharebased payment awards using an option pricing model is affected by the companys stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables these variables include the companys expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors riskfree interest rates and expected dividends the table below presents the weightedaverage input assumptions used and resulting fair values for options granted or issued in business combinations during each respective year the stockbased compensation expense for options is recorded ratably over the requisite service period the interest rate assumptions were determined by using the fiveyear us treasury note yield on the date of grant or date of acquisition the company did not grant stock option awards during 2017 

the company issues various restricted stock awards which contain a market condition a performance condition a service condition or any combination of the three restricted stock awards are valued based on the grantdate fair value of the award stockbased compensation expense is recognized over the employees requisite service period for awards with only a service condition for awards with a performance condition stockbased compensation expense is recorded from the service inception date through the conclusion of the measurement period based on managements estimates concerning the probability of vesting 

vesting of restricted stock awards with a market condition is based on the companys performance as measured by total shareholder return relative to the appreciation of a specified stock index over the measurement period subject to each participants continued employment with the company through the conclusion of the measurement period the fair value of the restricted stock awards with a market condition is estimated using a monte carlo simulation model the determination of the fair value of the awards is affected by the grant date and a number of variables each of which has been identified in the chart below for awards granted during each respective period sharebased compensation expense based on the fair value of the award is being recorded from the grant date through the conclusion of the measurement period 



the company also grants deferred stock awards to nonaffiliate independent directors which are rights to receive shares of common stock upon termination of service as a director in 2015 and prior the deferred stock awards were issued quarterly in arrears and vested immediately upon grant starting in 2016 the company issued the deferred stock awards immediately but the awards vest in full on the oneyear anniversary of the grant 

to the extent the company changes the terms of its stockbased compensation programs experiences market volatility in the pricing of its common stock that increases the implied volatility assumption used in the blackscholes model refines different assumptions or assumes stock awards from acquired companies that are different in nature than the companys stock award arrangements among other potential impacts the stockbased compensation expense recorded in future periods and the related tax benefits may differ significantly from what was recorded in previous reporting periods the company accounts for forfeitures of stockbased awards as they occur 

estimates of stockbased compensation expense are significant to the companys financial statements but this expense is partially based on the aforementioned option valuation and monte carlo simulation models and will never result in the payment of cash by the company for this reason and because the company does not view stockbased compensation as related to its 

operational performance the board of directors and management exclude stockbased compensation expense when evaluating the companys underlying business performance

the company has a software license agreement with nice that targets the emerging paradigm of datacenterbased deployment of simulation enginframe from nice is bundled with ansys ekm and facilitates running interactive ansys applications on remote data centers 

competition 

the company believes that the principal factors affecting sales of its software include ease of use breadth and depth of functionality flexibility quality ease of integration with other software systems file compatibility across computer platforms range of supported computer platforms performance price and total cost of ownership customer service and support company reputation and financial viability and effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts 

the company continues to experience competition across all markets for its products and services some of the companys current and possible future competitors have greater financial technical marketing and other resources than the company and some have wellestablished relationships with current and potential customers of the company the companys current and possible future competitors also include firms that have or may in the future elect to compete by means of open source licensing these competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes price reductions andor increased operating costs and could result in lower revenues margins and net income 

proprietary rights and licenses 

the company regards its software as proprietary and relies on a combination of trade secret copyright patent and trademark laws license agreements nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect its proprietary rights in its products the company distributes its software products under software license agreements that grant customers nonexclusive licenses which are typically nontransferable for the use of the companys products license agreements for the companys products are directly between the company and end users use of the licensed software product is restricted to specified sites unless the customer obtains a multisite license for its use of the software product software security measures are also employed to prevent unauthorized use of the companys software products and the licensed software is subject to terms and conditions prohibiting unauthorized reproduction customers may purchase a perpetual license of the technology with the right to annually purchase ongoing maintenance technical support and upgrades or may lease the product on a fixedterm basis for a fee that includes the license maintenance technical support and upgrades 

the company licenses its software products utilizing a combination of webbased and hardcopy license terms and forms for certain software products the company primarily relies on clickwrapped licenses the enforceability of these types of agreements under the laws of some jurisdictions is uncertain 

the company also seeks to protect the source code of its software as a trade secret and as unpublished copyrighted work the company has obtained federal trademark registration protection for ansys and other marks in the us and foreign countries additionally the company was awarded numerous patents by the us patent and trademark office and has a number of 

patent applications pending to the extent the company does not choose to seek patent protection for its intellectual property the company primarily relies on the protection of its source code as a trade secret 

employees of the company have signed agreements under which they have agreed not to disclose trade secrets or confidential information these agreements where legally permitted restrict engagement in or connection with any business that is competitive with the company anywhere in the world while employed by the company and in some cases for specified periods thereafter and state that any products or technology created by employees during their term of employment are the property of the company in addition the company requires all channel partners to enter into agreements not to disclose the companys trade secrets and other proprietary information 

despite these precautions there can be no assurance that misappropriation of the companys technology and proprietary information including source code will be prevented further there can be no assurance that copyright trademark patent and trade secret protection will be available for the companys products in certain jurisdictions or that restrictions on the ability of employees and channel partners to engage in activities competitive with the company will be enforceable costly and timeconsuming litigation could be necessary in the future to enforce the companys rights to its trade secrets and proprietary information or to enforce its patent rights and copyrights and it is possible that in the future the companys competitors may be able to obtain the companys trade secrets or to independently develop similar unpatented technology 

the software development industry is characterized by rapid technological change therefore the company believes that factors such as the technological and creative skills of its personnel new product developments frequent product enhancements name recognition and reliable product maintenance are also important to establishing and maintaining technology leadership in addition to the various legal protections of its technology that may be available 

the company does not believe that any of its products infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties there can be no assurance however that third parties will not claim such infringement by the company or its licensors or licensees with respect to current or future products the company expects that software suppliers will increasingly be subject to the risk of such claims as the number of products and suppliers continues to expand and the functionality of products continues to increase any such claims with or without merit could be time consuming result in costly litigation cause product release delays or require the company to enter into royalty or licensing agreements such royalty or licensing agreements if required may not be available on terms acceptable to the company 

seasonal variations 

the companys business has experienced seasonality including quarterly reductions in software sales resulting from slowdowns of customer activities during the summer months particularly in europe as well as from the seasonal purchasing and budgeting patterns of the companys global customers the companys revenue is typically highest in the fourth quarter 

deferred revenue and backlog 

deferred revenue consists of billings made or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from software license and maintenance agreements the deferred revenue on the companys consolidated balance sheets does not represent the total value of annual or multiyear noncancellable software license and maintenance agreements the companys backlog represents installment billings for periods beyond the current quarterly billing cycle and custom er orders received but not processed the companys deferred revenue and backlog as of december 31 2016  and 2015  consisted of the following 





revenue associated with deferred revenue and backlog that will be recognized in the subsequent twelve months is classified as current in the table above 

employees 

as of december 31 2016  the company employed approximately 2800  people at that date there were also contract personnel and coop students providing ongoing development services and technical support certain employees of the company are subject to collective bargaining agreements and have local work councils 

acquisitions 

the company makes targeted acquisitions in order to support its longterm strategic direction accelerate innovation provide increased capabilities to its existing products supply new products and services expand its customer base and enhance its distribution channels 

during the twelve  months ended december 31 2016  and 2015  the company completed various acquisitions to accelerate the development of new and innovative products to the marketplace while lowering design and engineering costs for customers the acquisitions were not individually significant the combined purchase prices of the acquisitions were approximately 103 million  and 497 million  for the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively

risk factors 

tableend information provided by the company or its spokespersons including information contained in this annual report on form 10k may from time to time contain forwardlooking statements concerning projected financial performance market and industry sector growth product development and commercialization or other aspects of future operations such statements will be based on the assumptions and expectations of the companys management at the time such statements are made the company cautions investors that its performance and therefore any forwardlooking statement is subject to risks and uncertainties various important factors including but not limited to the following may cause the companys future results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statement 

global economic conditions   the companys operations and performance depend significantly on foreign and domestic economic conditions uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment as well as geopolitical conditions have resulted in significant volatility in credit equity and foreign currency markets this volatility and the related economic conditions may negatively impact the company as customers defer spending in response to tighter credit higher unemployment financial market volatility government austerity programs negative financial news declining valuations of investments and other factors in addition certain of the companys customers budgets may be constrained and they may be unable to purchase the companys products at the same level as they have in prior periods customer spending levels may be impacted by decreased government spending in certain countries as concerns continue regarding economic conditions and government debt levels these conditions may persist or further deteriorate for an extended period of time as the global economy continues to experience volatility the company may be exposed to impairments of certain assets as their values deteriorate 

tighter credit due to economic conditions may diminish the companys future borrowing ability the companys customers ability to pay for the companys products and services may also be impaired which may lead to an increase in the companys allowance for doubtful accounts and writeoffs of accounts receivable since the company is exposed to the majority of major world markets uncertainty in any significant market may negatively impact the companys performance and results particularly with respect to the companys largest geographic customer bases the company is unable to predict the likely duration and severity of changing economic conditions or the likelihood of additional uncertainty arising in any of the companys key markets should these economic conditions result in the company not meeting its revenue growth objectives the companys operating results cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 

decline in customers businesses   the companys sales are based significantly on enduser demand for products in key industrial sectors many of these sectors periodically experience economic declines which may be exacerbated by other economic factors these factors may also adversely affect the companys business by extending sales cycles and reducing revenue these economic factors may cause the companys customers to reduce the size of their workforce or cut back on operations and may lead to a reduction in renewals of licenses or maintenance contracts with the company the companys customers may request discounts or extended payment terms on new products or seek to extend payment terms on existing contracts all of which may cause fluctuations in the companys future operating results the company may not be able to adjust its operating expenses to offset such fluctuations because a substantial portion of the companys operating expenses is related to personnel facilities and marketing programs the level of personnel and related expenses may not be able to be adjusted quickly and is based in significant part on the companys expectation for future revenue 

risks associated with international activities a majority of the companys business comes from outside the united states and the company has customers that supply a wide spectrum of goods and services in virtually all of the worlds major economic regions as the company continues to expand its sales presence in international regions the portion of its revenue expenses cash accounts receivable and payment obligations denominated in foreign currencies continues to increase if any of the foreign economies in which the company does business deteriorate or suffer periods of uncertainty the companys business and performance may be negatively impacted through reduced customer spending changes in purchasing cycles or timing reduced access to credit for its customers or other factors impacting the companys international sales and collections the companys results may also be negatively impacted by geopolitical tensions which may result in increased economic volatility 

as a result of its increasing international activities the company has revenue expenses cash accounts receivable and payment obligations denominated in foreign currencies as a result the company is subject to currency exchange risk the companys revenues and operating results are adversely affected when the us dollar strengthens relative to other currencies and are positively affected when the us dollar weakens as a result changes in currency exchange rates will affect the companys financial position results of operations and cash flows in the event that there are economic declines in countries in which the company conducts transactions the resulting changes in currency exchange rates may affect the companys financial position results of operations and cash flows the company is most impacted by movements in and among the japanese yen euro british pound south korean won indian rupee canadian dollar and us dollar the company seeks to reduce currency exchange transaction risks primarily through its normal operating and treasury activities but there can be no assurance that it will be successful in reducing these risks 

in june 2016 the united kingdom voted to leave the european union the longterm impact of the decision is uncertain as a result the companys business in the united kingdom and europe could be adversely impacted due to political and economic instability fluctuations in currency exchange rates changes in laws and regulations and other factors these risks could negatively impact the companys financial position results of operations and cash flows 

in may 2018 a new set of data protection rules will go into effect in the european union these rules provide a unified and comprehensive set of requirements for data protection of individuals within the european union the company will be subject to these requirements which include potentially significant monetary penalties for noncompliance if the company fails to comply with the new regulations its reputation may suffer and its financial position results of operations and cash flows may be negatively impacted 

additional risks inherent in the companys international business activities include imposition of government controls export license requirements restrictions on the export of critical technology products and services the violation of anticorruption laws and regulations which are applicable to the company by third parties in countries where such conduct may be permissible or commonplace political and economic instability trade restrictions changes in tariffs and taxes difficulties in staffing and managing international operations changes in data privacy regulations longer accounts receivable payment cycles and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations effective patent copyright trademark and trade secret protection may not be available in every foreign country in which the company sells its products and services the companys business financial position results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks 

sales forecasts  the company makes many operational and strategic decisions based upon short and longterm sales forecasts the companys sales personnel continually monitor the status of all proposals including the estimated closing date and the value of the sale in order to forecast quarterly sales these forecasts are subject to significant estimation and are impacted by many external factors including global economic conditions and the performance of the companys customers a variation in actual sales activity from that forecasted could cause the company to plan or budget incorrectly and therefore could adversely affect the companys business financial position results of operations and cash flows the companys management team forecasts macroeconomic trends and developments and integrates them through longrange planning into budgets research and development strategies and a wide variety of general management duties global economic conditions and the effect those conditions and other disruptions in global markets have on the companys customers may have a significant impact on the accuracy of the companys sales forecasts these conditions may increase the likelihood or the magnitude of variations between actual sales activity and the companys sales forecasts and as a result the companys performance may be hindered because of a failure to properly match corporate strategy with economic conditions this in turn may adversely affect the companys business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

stock market and stock price volatility  market prices for securities of software companies have generally been volatile in particular the market price of the companys common stock has been and may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations as a result of factors affecting the company the software industry or the securities markets in general such factors include but are not limited to declines in trading price that may be triggered by the companys failure to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors moreover the trading price could be subject to additional fluctuations in response to quartertoquarter variations in the companys operating results material announcements made by the company or its competitors conditions in the financial markets or the software industry generally or other events and factors many of which are beyond the companys control 

rapidly changing technology new products risk of product errors the company operates in an industry generally characterized by rapidly changing technology and frequent new product introductions which can render existing products obsolete or unmarketable a major factor in the companys future success will be its ability to anticipate technological changes and to develop and introduce in a timely manner enhancements to its existing products products acquired in acquisitions and new products to meet those changes if the company is unable to introduce new products and to respond quickly to industry changes its business financial position results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

the introduction and marketing of new or enhanced products require the company to manage the transition from existing products in order to minimize disruption in customer purchasing patterns there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing and marketing on a timely basis new products or product enhancements that the new products will adequately address the changing needs of the marketplace or that the company will successfully manage the transition from existing products software products as complex as those offered by the company may contain undetected errors when first introduced or as new versions are released and the likelihood of errors is increased as a result of the companys commitment to the frequency of its product releases there can be no assurance that errors will not be found in any new or enhanced products after the commencement of commercial shipments certain products require a higher level of sales and support expertise failure of the companys sales channel particularly the indirect channel to obtain this expertise and to sell the new product offerings effectively could have an adverse impact on the companys sales in future periods any of these problems may result in the loss of or delay in customer acceptance diversion of development resources damage to the companys reputation or increased service and warranty costs any of which could have a material adverse effect on the companys business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

product quality the company has separate quality systems and registrations under the iso 90012008 standard in addition to other governmental and industrial regulations the companys continued compliance with quality standards and favorable outcomes in periodic examinations is important to retain current customers and vital to procure new sales if the company was determined not to be compliant with various regulatory or iso 90019000 standards its certificates of registration could be suspended requiring remedial action and a timeconsuming reregistration process product quality issues or failures could result in the companys reputation becoming diminished resulting in a material adverse impact on revenue operating margins net income financial position and cash flows 

competition  the company continues to experience competition across all markets for its products and services some of the companys current and possible future competitors have greater financial technical marketing and other resources than the company and some have wellestablished relationships with current and potential customers of the company the companys current and possible future competitors also include firms that have competed or may in the future elect to compete by means of open source licensing parties among the companys current or future strategic alliances may diminish or sever technical software development and marketing relationships with the company for competitive purposes these competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes price reductions andor increased operating costs and could result in lower revenues margins and net income 

changes in the companys pricing models the intense competition the company faces in the sales of its products and services and general economic and business conditions can put pressure on the company to adjust its prices if the companys competitors offer deep discounts on certain products or services or develop products that the marketplace considers more valuable the company may need to lower prices or offer discounts or other favorable terms in order to compete successfully any such changes may reduce operating margins and could adversely affect operating results the companys maintenance products which include software license updates and product support fees are generally priced as a percentage of its new software license fees the companys competitors may offer lower percentage pricing on product updates and support that could put pressure on the company to further discount its new license or product support prices 

any broadbased change to the companys prices and pricing policies could cause new software license and service revenues to decline or be delayed as its sales force implements and its customers adjust to the new pricing policies some of the companys competitors may bundle software products for promotional purposes or as a longterm pricing strategy or provide guarantees of prices product implementations or wider geographical license usage provisions these practices could over time significantly constrain the prices that the company can charge for certain products if the company does not adapt its pricing models to reflect changes in customer use of its products or changes in customer demand the companys new software license revenues could decrease additionally increased distribution of applications through application service providers including softwareasaservice providers may reduce the average price for the companys products or adversely affect other sales of the companys products reducing new software license revenues unless the company can offset price reductions with volume increases the increase in open source software distribution may also cause the company to adjust its pricing models 

dependence on senior management and key technical personnel  the companys success depends upon the continued services of the companys senior executives key technical employees and other employees each of the companys executive officers key technical personnel and other employees could terminate his or her relationship with the company at any time the loss of any of the companys senior executives might significantly delay or prevent the achievement of the companys business objectives and could materially harm the companys business and customer relationships 

in addition because of the highly technical nature of the companys products the company must attract and retain highly skilled engineering and development personnel many of whom are recruited from outside of the united states the market for this talent is highly competitive the company is limited in its ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws if the immigration laws become stricter or if the company has less success in recruiting and retaining key personnel the companys business reputation and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 

dependence on proprietary technology  the companys success is highly dependent upon its proprietary technology the company generally relies on contracts and the laws of copyrights patents trademarks and trade secrets to protect its technology the company maintains a trade secrets program enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees and channel partners and limits access to and distribution of its software documentation and other proprietary information there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company to protect its proprietary technology will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of its technology by third parties or that third parties will not be able to develop similar technology independently costly and timeconsuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of trade secret rights and related confidentiality and nondisclosure provisions although the company is not aware that any of its technology infringes upon the rights of third parties there can be no assurance that other parties will not assert technology infringement claims against the company or that if asserted such claims will not prevail 

risks associated with security of the companys products source code and it systems the company makes significant efforts to maintain and improve the security and integrity of its products source code computer systems and data despite significant efforts to create security barriers to such programs it is virtually impossible for the company to entirely mitigate this risk there appears to be an increasing number of computer “hackers” developing and deploying a variety of destructive software programs such as viruses worms and the like that could attack the companys products and computer systems because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to networks or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target the company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures like all software products the companys software is vulnerable to such attacks the impact of such an attack could disrupt the proper functioning of the companys software products cause errors in the output of its customers work allow unauthorized access to sensitive proprietary or confidential information of the company or its customers and result in other destructive outcomes if this were to occur the companys reputation may suffer customers may stop buying products the company could face lawsuits and potential liability and the companys financial performance could be negatively impacted 

there is also a danger of industrial espionage cyberattacks misuse theft of information or assets including source code or damage to assets by people who have gained unauthorized access to the companys facilities systems or information such cybersecurity breaches misuse or other disruptions could lead to the disclosure of portions of the companys product source code or other confidential information improper usage and distribution of the companys products without compensation illegal usage of the companys products which could jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through its computer systems and theft manipulation and destruction of private and proprietary data resulting in defective products and production downtimes although the company actively employs measures to combat unlicensed copying access and use of software and intellectual property through a variety of techniques preventing unauthorized use or infringement of the companys rights is inherently difficult these events could adversely affect the companys financial results or could result in significant claims for damages against it participating in lawsuits to protect against any such unauthorized access to usage of or disclosure of any of the companys products or any portion of the companys product source code or in prosecutions in connection with any such cybersecurity breach could be costly and timeconsuming and may divert managements attention and adversely affect the markets perception of the company and its products 

policing the unauthorized distribution and use of the companys products is difficult and software piracy including online piracy is a persistent problem the proliferation of technology designed to circumvent typical software protection measures used in the companys products and the possibility of methods that circumvent the techniques it employs in its products may lead to an expansion in piracy or misuse of its products and intellectual property as a result and despite the companys efforts to prevent such activities and to prosecute instances of such activities the company may nonetheless lose significant revenue due to illegal use of its software and managements attention may be diverted to address specific instances of piracy or misuse or to address piracy and misuse in general 

a number of the companys core processes such as software development sales and marketing customer service and financial transactions rely on its it infrastructure and applications the company also relies upon thirdparty products which are exposed to various security vulnerabilities malicious software sabotage and other cybersecurity breaches of the types discussed above could cause an outage of the companys infrastructure which could lead to a substantial denial of service and ultimately to production downtime recovery costs and customer claims this could have a significant negative impact on the companys business financial position profit and cash flows 

the company has implemented a number of measures designed to ensure the security of its information it resources and other assets nonetheless unauthorized users could gain access to its systems through cyberattacks and steal use without authorization and sabotage the companys intellectual property and confidential data any breach of its it security misuse or theft could lead to loss of production recovery costs or litigation brought by employees customers or business partners which could have a significant negative impact on the companys business financial position profit cash flows and reputation 

implementation of it systems  the company is currently implementing a new customer relationship management crm system and moving the billing and revenue recognition processes from the company’s existing erp accounting system to an application of the new crm system while these systems along with the redesign of the processes described above are anticipated to simplify the sales and order processing efforts and to enhance customer service and aid in the application of the new revenue accounting standard there is a risk that the project will not achieve the anticipated benefits or that the benefits will not be achieved as quickly as anticipated the project implementation timeline and scope may change and become longer and broader as new facets of the design and implementation efforts are undertaken this may take the attention of key operational management away from other aspects of the business including the integration of acquisitions and also result in increased consulting and software costs these factors may have a significant negative impact on the companys business financial position profit cash flows and reputation 

dependence on channel partners  the company continues to distribute a meaningful portion of its products through its global network of independent regional channel partners the channel partners sell the companys software products to new and existing customers expand installations within the existing customer base offer consulting services and provide the first line of technical support consequently in certain geographies the company is highly dependent upon the efforts of the channel partners difficulties in ongoing relationships with channel partners such as failure to meet performance criteria or to promote the companys products as aggressively as the company expects and differences in the handling of customer relationships could adversely affect the companys performance additionally the loss of any major channel partner for any reason including a channel partners decision to sell competing products rather than the companys products could have a material adverse effect on the company moreover the companys future success will depend substantially on the ability and willingness of its channel partners to continue to dedicate the resources necessary to promote the companys portfolio of products and to support a larger installed base of the companys products if the channel partners are unable or unwilling to do so the company may be unable to sustain revenue growth 

the company has been increasing its number of channel partners particularly in international locations the business relationships with these channel partners are recently established and could result in additional compliance burdens for the company these partners also have a lessestablished payment history with the company and revenue from these partners could come with a higher rate of bad debt expense 

during times of significant fluctuations in world currencies certain channel partners may have solvency issues to the extent that effective hedge transactions are not employed or there is not sufficient working capital in particular if the us dollar strengthens relative to other currencies certain channel partners who pay the company in us dollars may have trouble paying the company on time or may have trouble distributing the companys products due to the impact of the currency exchange fluctuation on such channel partners cash flows this may impact the companys ability to distribute its products into certain regions and markets and may have an adverse effect on the companys results of operations and cash flows 

reliance on perpetual licenses  although the company has historically maintained stable recurring revenue from the sale of software lease licenses and software maintenance subscriptions it also has relied on sales of perpetual licenses that involve the payment of a single upfront fee historically these licenses have been more typical in the computer software industry and remain as the preferred licensing approach in certain markets while revenue generated from software lease licenses and software maintenance subscriptions currently represents a portion of the companys revenue to the extent that perpetual license revenue continues to represent a significant percentage of total revenue the companys revenue in any period will depend significantly on sales completed during that period if customer purchasing patterns shift toward a stronger preference for lease licenses and fewer perpetual licenses as the company has recently experienced there could be a shortterm adverse impact on the companys revenue and profitability 

renewal rates for annual lease and maintenance contracts a substantial portion of the companys license and maintenance revenue is derived from annual lease and maintenance contracts these contracts are generally renewed on an annual basis and typically have a high rate of customer renewal in addition to the recurring revenue base associated with these contracts a majority of customers purchasing new perpetual licenses also purchase related annual maintenance contracts if the rate of renewal for these contracts is adversely affected by economic or other factors the companys license and maintenance growth will be adversely affected over the term that the revenue for those contracts would have otherwise been recognized as a result the companys business financial position results of operations and cash flows may also be adversely impacted during those periods 

risks associated with acquisitions historically the company has consummated acquisitions in order to support the companys longterm strategic direction accelerate innovation provide increased capabilities to existing products supply new products and services expand its customer base and enhance its distribution channels the company has completed a number of acquisitions in recent years and expects to make additional acquisitions in the future but may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or if suitable candidates are identified the company may not be able to complete the business combination on commercially acceptable terms the process of exploring and pursuing acquisition opportunities may result in devotion of significant management and financial resources 

even if the company is able to consummate acquisitions that it believes will be successful such transactions present many risks including among others difficulty in integrating the management teams strategies cultures and operations of the companies failing to achieve anticipated synergies and revenue increases difficulty incorporating and integrating the acquired technologies or products with the companys existing product lines difficulty in coordinating establishing or expanding sales distribution and marketing functions as necessary difficulty in training the global sales team to sell the acquired products failure to develop new products and services that utilize the technologies and resources of the companies disruption of the companys ongoing business and diversion of managements attention to transition or integration issues unanticipated and unknown liabilities the loss of key employees customers partners and channel partners of the company or of the acquired 

company resulting in the loss of key information expertise or knowhow and unanticipated additional recruitment and training costs and difficulties implementing and maintaining sufficient controls policies and procedures over the systems products and processes of the acquired company if the company does not achieve the anticipated benefits of its acquisitions as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by the companys management and financial or industry analysts there could be a material adverse effect on the companys stock price business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

in addition for companies acquired limited experience will exist for several quarters following the acquisition relating to how the acquired companys sales pipelines will convert into sales or revenues and the conversion rate postacquisition may be quite different than the historical conversion rate because a substantial portion of the companys sales are completed in the latter part of a quarter and its cost structure is largely fixed in the shortterm revenue shortfalls may have a negative impact on the companys profitability a delay in a small number of large new software license transactions could cause the companys quarterly software license revenues to fall significantly short of its predictions 

the company may periodically be involved in business combinations with enterprises that are developmental in nature while these entities have leadingedge technology they may not have developed direct or indirect distribution channels and may not have software revenues which cover the ongoing expenses therefore the company may have a decrease in operating margin and profitability while these types of acquisitions are integrated and the distribution channel incorporates the new product offerings 

disruption of operations or infrastructure failures  a significant portion of the companys software development personnel source code and computer equipment is located at operating facilities in the united states canada india japan and throughout europe the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unforeseen catastrophe at any of these facilities could cause interruptions in the companys operations services and product development activities additionally if the company experiences problems that impair its business infrastructure such as a computer virus telephone system failure or an intentional disruption of its information technology systems by a third party these interruptions could have a material adverse effect on the companys business financial position results of operations cash flows and the ability to meet financial reporting deadlines further because the companys sales are not generally linear during any quarterly period the potential adverse effects resulting from any of the events described above or any other disruption of the companys business could be accentuated if it occurs close to the end of a fiscal quarter 

risks associated with significant sales to existing customers  a significant portion of the companys sales includes followon sales to existing customers that invest in the companys broad suite of engineering simulation software and services if a significant number of current customers were to become dissatisfied with the companys products and services or choose to license or utilize competitive offerings the companys followon sales and recurring lease and maintenance revenues could be materially adversely impacted resulting in reduced revenue operating margins net income and cash flows 

industry consolidation  consolidation in industries that utilize the company’s software may result in combined workforces 

where economies of scale and synergies are achieved and fewer ansys software licenses are required consolidation may 

also result in the newly combinedsurviving entity wanting the most favorable pricing from the former contracts and expecting 

larger volume discounts on future purchases if a customer is acquired by an entity that does not utilize ansys in favor of a competing product the company may not have future orders from the enterprise further consolidation of the companys competitors may result in synergies that allow those competitors to benefit from broader sales channels and increased access to capital any of these impacts could adversely affect the companys business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

periodic reorganization of sales force  the company relies heavily on its direct sales force from time to time the company reorganizes and makes adjustments to its sales leadership andor its sales force in response to such factors as management changes performance issues market opportunities and other considerations these changes may result in a temporary lack of sales production and may adversely impact revenue in future quarters there can be no assurance that the company will not restructure its sales force in future periods or that the transition issues associated with such a restructuring will not occur 

income tax estimates  the company makes significant estimates in determining its worldwide income tax provision these estimates involve complex tax regulations in a number of jurisdictions across the companys global operations and are subject to many transactions and calculations in which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain the final outcome of tax matters could be different than the estimates reflected in the historical income tax provision and related accruals such differences could have a material impact on income tax expense and net income in the periods in which such determinations are made

for further information on the companys business combinations see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k 

results of operations 

for purposes of the following discussion and analysis the table below sets forth certain consolidated financial data for the years 2016  2015  and 2014  the operating results of the companys acquisitions have been included in the results of operations since their respective acquisition dates 



year ended december 31 2016  compared to year ended december 31 2015 

revenue 



the companys revenue increased 48  during the year ended december 31 2016  as compared to the year ended december 31 2015  while revenue grew 51  in constant currency the growth rate was favorably impacted by the companys continued investment in its global sales support and marketing organizations and was adversely impacted by a recent shift in the licensing preference of certain customers from perpetual licenses to lease licenses lease license revenue increased 76  as compared to the prior year perpetual license revenue which is derived primarily from new sales decreased 46  as compared to the prior year annual maintenance contracts that were sold with new perpetual licenses along with maintenance contracts sold with new perpetual licenses in previous years contributed to maintenance revenue growth of 83  

with respect to revenue on average for the year ended december 31 2016  the us dollar was 05  stronger when measured against the companys primary foreign currencies than for the year ended december 31 2015  the net overall strengthening resulted in decreased revenue of 22 million  during the year ended december 31 2016  as compared to the year ended december 31 2015  the impact on revenue was primarily driven by 56 million  39 million  17 million  and 09 million  of adverse impact due to a weaker euro british pound south korean won and indian rupee respectively partially offset by 104 million  of favorable impact due to a stronger japanese yen the fluctuations in the us dollar resulted in increased operating income of 09 million  during the year ended december 31 2016  as compared to the year ended december 31 2015  

a substantial portion of the companys license and maintenance revenue is derived from annual lease and maintenance contracts these contracts are generally renewed on an annual basis and typically have a high rate of customer renewal in addition to the recurring revenue base associated with these contracts a majority of customers purchasing new perpetual licenses also purchase related annual maintenance contracts as a result of the significant recurring revenue base the companys license and maintenance revenue growth rate in any period does not necessarily correlate to the growth rate of new license and maintenance contracts sold during that period to the extent the rate of customer renewal for lease and maintenance contracts is high incremental lease contracts and maintenance contracts sold with new perpetual licenses will result in license and maintenance revenue growth in constant currency conversely if the rate of renewal for these contracts is adversely affected by economic or other factors the companys license and maintenance growth will be adversely affected over the term that the revenue for those contracts would have otherwise been recognized 

the company is starting to experience an increased interest by some of its larger customers in enterprise agreements that often include longerterm timebased licenses involving a larger number of the companys software products while these arrangements typically involve a higher overall transaction price the revenue from these contracts is typically deferred and recognized over the period of the contract resulting in increased deferred revenue and backlog to the extent these types of contracts replace sales of perpetual licenses there could be a nearterm adverse impact on software license and maintenance revenue growth the company is similarly experiencing a shifting preference from perpetual licenses to timebased licenses across a broader spectrum of its customers particularly in the more mature geographic markets such as the us and japan to the extent this shift continues or becomes more prevalent the result could be a similar and incremental nearterm adverse impact on software license and maintenance revenue growth 

international and domestic revenues as a percentage of total revenue were 628  and 372  respectively during the year ended december 31 2016  and 624  and 376  respectively during the year ended december 31 2015  the company derived 244  and 242  of its total revenue through the indirect sales channel for the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively 

in valuing deferred revenue on the balance sheets of the companys recent acquisitions as of their respective acquisition dates the company applied the fair value provisions applicable to the accounting for business combinations resulting in a reduction of deferred revenue as compared to its historical carrying amount as a result the companys postacquisition revenue will be less than the sum of what would have otherwise been reported by ansys and each acquiree absent the acquisitions the impacts on reported revenue for the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  were 01 million  and 17 million  respectively

the increase in the effective tax rate from the prior year is primarily due to tax benefits related to the merger of the companys japan subsidiaries in 2010 recognized in 2015 that did not recur in 2016 partially offset by tax benefits from restructuring activities in 2016 when compared to the federal and state combined statutory rate the effective tax rates for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 were favorably impacted by the domestic manufacturing deduction and research and development credits the quarterly benefit of approximately 31 million  associated with the merger of the companys japan subsidiaries was fully amortized in the third quarter of 2015 there will be no additional ongoing benefit from this transaction the rates were also favorably impacted by the recurring item of lower statutory tax rates in many of the companys foreign jurisdictions

net income  the companys net income for the year ended december 31 2015 was 2525 million as compared to net income of 2547 million for the year ended december 31 2014 diluted earnings per share was 276 for the year ended december 31 2015 and 270 for the year ended december 31 2014 the weighted average shares used in computing diluted earnings per share were 915 million and 942 million for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively 

nongaap results 

the company provides nongaap revenue nongaap operating income nongaap operating profit margin nongaap net income and nongaap diluted earnings per share as supplemental measures to gaap regarding the companys operational performance these financial measures exclude the impact of certain items and therefore have not been calculated in accordance with gaap a detailed explanation and a reconciliation of each nongaap financial measure to its most comparable gaap financial measure are described below 





 nongaap measures 

management uses nongaap financial measures a to evaluate the companys historical and prospective financial performance as well as its performance relative to its competitors b to set internal sales targets and spending budgets c to allocate resources d to measure operational profitability and the accuracy of forecasting e to assess financial discipline over operational expenditures and f as an important factor in determining variable compensation for management and its employees in addition many financial analysts that follow the company focus on and publish both historical results and future projections based on nongaap financial measures the company believes that it is in the best interest of its investors to provide this information to analysts so that they accurately report the nongaap financial information moreover investors have historically requested and the company has historically reported these nongaap financial measures as a means of providing consistent and comparable information with past reports of financial results 

while management believes that these nongaap financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors there are limitations associated with the use of these nongaap financial measures these nongaap financial measures are not prepared in accordance with gaap are not reported by all of the companys competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of the companys competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation the company compensates for these limitations by using these nongaap financial measures as supplements to gaap financial measures and by reviewing the reconciliations of the nongaap financial measures to their most comparable gaap financial measures 

the adjustments to these nongaap financial measures and the basis for such adjustments are outlined below 

acquisition accounting for deferred revenue and its related tax impact historically the company has consummated acquisitions in order to support its strategic and other business objectives in accordance with the fair value provisions applicable to the accounting for business combinations acquired deferred revenue is often recorded on the opening balance sheet at an amount that is lower than the historical carrying value although this acquisition accounting requirement has no impact on the companys business or cash flow it adversely impacts the companys reported gaap revenue in the reporting periods following an acquisition in order to provide investors with financial information that facilitates comparison of both historical and future results the company provides nongaap financial measures which exclude the impact of the acquisition accounting adjustment the company believes that this nongaap financial adjustment is useful to investors because it allows investors to a evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in its financial and operational decisionmaking and b compare past and future reports of financial results of the company as the revenue reduction related to acquired deferred revenue will not recur when related annual lease licenses and software maintenance contracts are renewed in future periods 

amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions and its related tax impact the company incurs amortization of intangible assets included in its gaap presentation of amortization expense related to various acquisitions it has made management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating nongaap operating income nongaap operating profit margin nongaap net income and nongaap diluted earnings per share when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the company because these costs are fixed at the time of an acquisition are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition accordingly management does not consider these expenses for purposes of evaluating the performance of the company during the applicable time period after the acquisition and it excludes such expenses when making decisions to allocate resources the company believes that these nongaap financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to a evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in its financial and operational decisionmaking and b compare past reports of financial results of the company as the company has historically reported these nongaap financial measures 

stockbased compensation expense and its related tax impact  the company incurs expense related to stockbased compensation included in its gaap presentation of cost of software licenses cost of maintenance and service research and development expense and selling general and administrative expense stockbased compensation expense benefit incurred in connection with the companys deferred compensation plan held in a rabbi trust includes an offsetting benefit charge recorded in other income expense although stockbased compensation is an expense of the company and viewed as a form of compensation management excludes these expenses for the purpose of calculating nongaap operating income nongaap operating profit margin nongaap net income and nongaap diluted earnings per share when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the company management similarly excludes income expense related to assets held in a rabbi trust in connection with the companys deferred compensation plan specifically the company excludes stockbased compensation and income related to assets held in the deferred compensation plan rabbi trust during its annual budgeting process and its quarterly and annual assessments of the companys and managements performance the annual budgeting process is the primary mechanism whereby the company allocates resources to various initiatives and operational requirements additionally the annual review by the board of directors during which it compares the companys historical business model and profitability to the planned business model and profitability for the forthcoming year excludes the impact of stockbased compensation in evaluating the performance of senior management and department managers charges related to stockbased compensation are excluded from expenditure and profitability results in fact the company records stockbased compensation expense into a standalone cost center for which no single operational manager is responsible or accountable in this way management is able to review on a periodtoperiod basis each managers performance and assess financial discipline over operational expenditures without the effect of stockbased compensation the company believes that these nongaap financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to a evaluate the companys operating results and the effectiveness of the methodology used by management to review the companys operating results and b review historical comparability in the companys financial reporting as well as comparability with competitors operating results 

restructuring charges and the related tax impact  the company occasionally incurs expenses for restructuring its workforce included in its gaap presentation of cost of software licenses cost of maintenance and service research and development expense and selling general and administrative expense management excludes these expenses for the purpose of calculating nongaap operating income nongaap operating profit margin nongaap net income and nongaap diluted earnings per share when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the company as it generally generally does not incur these expenses as a part of its operations the company believes that these nongaap financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to a evaluate the companys operating results and the effectiveness of the methodology used by management to review the companys operating results and b review historical comparability in the companys financial reporting as well as comparability with competitors operating results 

transaction costs related to business combinations the company incurs expenses for professional services rendered in connection with business combinations which are included in its gaap presentation of selling general and administrative expense these expenses are generally not taxdeductible management excludes these acquisitionrelated transaction expenses for the purpose of calculating nongaap operating income nongaap operating profit margin nongaap net income and nongaap diluted earnings per share when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the company as it generally would not have otherwise incurred these expenses in the periods presented as a part of its operations the company believes that these nongaap financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to a evaluate the companys operating results and the effectiveness of the methodology used by management to review the companys operating results and b review historical comparability in the companys financial reporting as well as comparability with competitors operating results 

nongaap financial measures are not in accordance with or an alternative for gaap the companys nongaap financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable gaap financial measures and should be read only in conjunction with the companys consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap 

the company has provided a reconciliation of the nongaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures as listed below

offbalancesheet arrangements 

the company does not have any specialpurpose entities or offbalancesheet financing 

contractual obligations 

the companys significant contractual obligations as of december 31 2016  are summarized below 





critical accounting policies and estimates 

the company believes that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition  revenue is derived principally from the licensing of computer software products and from related maintenance contracts revenue from perpetual licenses is classified as license revenue and is recognized upon delivery of the licensed product and the utility that enables the customer to access authorization keys provided that acceptance has occurred and a signed contractual obligation has been received the price is fixed and determinable and collectibility of the receivable is probable the company determines the fair value of postcontract customer support pcs sold together with perpetual licenses based on the rate charged for pcs when sold separately revenue from pcs contracts is classified as maintenance and service revenue and is recognized ratably over the term of the contract 

revenue for software lease licenses is classified as license revenue and is recognized over the period of the lease contract typically the companys software leases include pcs which due to the short term principally one year or less of the companys software lease licenses cannot be separated from lease revenue for accounting purposes as a result both the lease licenses and pcs are recognized ratably over the lease period due to the shortterm nature of the software lease licenses and the frequency with which the company provides major product upgrades typically annually the company does not believe that a significant portion of the fee paid under the arrangement is attributable to the pcs component of the arrangement and as a result includes the revenue for the entire arrangement within software license revenue in the consolidated statements of income 

many of the companys semiconductor products are typically licensed via longer term leases of 24–36 months the company recognizes revenue for these licenses over the term of the lease contract because the company does not have vendorspecific objective evidence of the fair value of these leases the company also recognizes revenue from perpetual licenses over the term of the lease contract during the infrequent occurrence of these licenses being sold with semiconductor leases in multipleelement arrangements 

revenue from training support and other services is recognized as the services are performed the company applies the specific performance method to contracts in which the service consists of a single act such as providing a training class to a customer and the proportional performance method to other service contracts that are longer in duration and often include multiple acts for example both training and consulting in applying the proportional performance method the company typically utilizes outputbased estimates for services with contractual billing arrangements that are not based on time and materials and estimates output based on the total tasks completed as compared to the total tasks required for each work contract inputbased estimates are utilized for services that involve general consultations with contractual billing arrangements based on time and materials utilizing direct labor as the input measure 

the company also executes arrangements through independent channel partners in which the channel partners are authorized to market and distribute the companys software products to end users of the companys products and services in specified territories in sales facilitated by channel partners the channel partner bears the risk of collection from the enduser customer the company recognizes revenue from transactions with channel partners when the channel partner submits a written purchase commitment collectibility from the channel partner is probable a license agreement signed by the enduser customer is received and delivery has occurred provided that all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied revenue from channel partner transactions is the amount remitted to the company by the channel partners this amount includes a fee for pcs that is compensation for providing technical enhancements and the second level of technical support to the end user which is based on the rate charged for pcs when sold separately and is recognized over the period that pcs is to be provided the company does not offer right of return product rotation or price protection to any of its channel partners 

nonincome related taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as accounts receivable and accrued expenses the collection and payment of these amounts are reported on a net basis in the consolidated statements of income and do not impact reported revenues or expenses 

the company warrants to its customers that its software will substantially perform as specified in the companys most current user manuals the company has not experienced significant claims related to software warranties beyond the scope of maintenance support which the company is already obligated to provide consequently the company has not established reserves for warranty obligations 

the companys agreements with its customers generally require it to indemnify the customer against claims that the companys software infringes thirdparty patent copyright trademark or other proprietary rights such indemnification obligations are generally limited in a variety of industrystandard respects including the companys right to replace an infringing product as of december 31 2016  the company had not experienced any losses related to these indemnification obligations and no claims with respect thereto were outstanding the company does not expect significant claims related to these indemnification obligations and consequently the company has not established any related reserves 

allowance for doubtful accounts  the company makes judgments as to its ability to collect outstanding receivables and provides allowances for a portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices from both value and delinquency perspectives for those invoices not specifically reviewed provisions are provided at differing rates based upon the age of the receivable and the geographic area of origin in determining these percentages the company considers its historical collection experience and current economic trends in the customers industry and geographic region if the historical data used to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and future results of operations could be materially affected 

income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period of the enactment date 

the company records net deferred tax assets to the extent it believes these assets will more likely than not be realized in making such determination the company considers all available positive and negative evidence including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and recent financial operations in the event the company determines that it will be able to realize deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance was used to reduce their carrying value the adjustment to the valuation allowance will be recorded as a reduction to the provision for income taxes 

tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a morelikelythannot threshold otherwise these tax benefits are recorded when a tax position has been effectively settled which means that the statute of limitations has expired or the appropriate taxing authority has completed their examination even though the statute of limitations remains open the company recognizes interest and penalties related to income taxes within the income tax expense line in the consolidated statements of income accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheets 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets the company tests goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment at least annually by performing a quantitative assessment of whether the fair value of each reporting unit or asset exceeds its carrying amount goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level and indefinitelived intangible assets are tested at the individual asset level this requires the company to assess and make judgments regarding a variety of factors which impact the fair value of the reporting unit or asset being tested including business plans anticipated future cash flows economic projections and other market data because there are inherent uncertainties involved in these factors significant differences between these estimates and actual results could result in future impairment charges and could materially impact the companys future financial results during the first quarter of 2016  the company completed the annual impairment test for goodwill and the indefinitelived intangible asset and determined that these assets had not been impaired as of the test date january 1 2016  no other events or circumstances changed during the twelve months ended december 31 2016  that would indicate that the fair values of the companys reporting unit and indefinitelived intangible asset are below their carrying values 

contingencies   the company is involved in various investigations claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business including commercial disputes labor and employment matters tax audits alleged infringement of intellectual property rights and other matters the company reviews the status of these matters assesses its financial exposure and records a related accrual if the potential loss from an investigation claim or legal proceeding is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable significant judgment is involved in the determination of probability and in the determination of whether an exposure is reasonably estimable as a result of the uncertainties involved in making these estimates the company may have to revise its estimates as facts and circumstances change the revision of these estimates could have a material impact on the companys financial position and results of operations 

stockbased compensation the company grants options and other stock awards to employees and directors under the companys stock option and grant plan eligible employees can also purchase shares of the companys common stock at a 

discount under the companys employee stock purchase plan the benefits provided under these plans are sharebased payments subject to the provisions of sharebased payment accounting guidance the company uses the fair value method to apply the provisions of sharebased payment accounting guidance stockbased compensation expense for 2016  2015  and 2014  was 333 million  340 million  and 369 million  respectively as of december 31 2016  total unrecognized estimated compensation expense related to unvested stock options and awards granted prior to that date was 651 million  which is expected to be recognized over a weightedaverage period of 19 years  

the value of each stock option award was estimated on the date of grant or date of acquisition for options issued in a business combination using the blackscholes option pricing model “blackscholes model” the determination of the fair value of sharebased payment awards using an option pricing model is affected by the companys stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables these variables include the companys expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors riskfree interest rates and expected dividends the table below presents the weightedaverage input assumptions used and resulting fair values for options granted or issued in business combinations during each respective year the stockbased compensation expense for options is recorded ratably over the requisite service period the interest rate assumptions were determined by using the fiveyear us treasury note yield on the date of grant or date of acquisition   



the company issues various restricted stock awards which contain a market condition a performance condition a service condition or any combination of the three restricted stock awards are valued based on the grantdate fair value of the award stock compensation expense is recognized over the employees requisite service period for awards with only a service condition for awards with a performance condition stockbased compensation expense is recorded from the service inception date through the conclusion of the measurement period based on managements estimates concerning the probability of vesting 

vesting of restricted stock awards with a market condition is based on the companys performance as measured by total shareholder return relative to the appreciation of a specified stock index over the measurement period subject to each participants continued employment with the company through the conclusion of the measurement period the fair value of the restricted stock awards with a market condition is estimated using a monte carlo simulation model the determination of the fair value of the awards is affected by the grant date and a number of variables each of which has been identified in the chart below for awards granted during each respective period sharebased compensation expense based on the fair value of the award is being recorded from the grant date through the conclusion of the measurement period 



the company also grants deferred stock awards to nonaffiliate independent directors which are rights to receive shares of common stock upon termination of service as a director in 2015 and prior the deferred stock awards were issued quarterly in arrears and vested immediately upon grant in 2016 the company issued the deferred stock awards immediately but the awards vest in full on the oneyear anniversary of the grant 

to the extent the company changes the terms of its stockbased compensation programs experiences market volatility in the pricing of its common stock that increases the implied volatility assumption used in the blackscholes model refines different 

assumptions in future periods such as forfeiture rates that differ from current estimates or assumes stock awards from acquired companies that are different in nature than the companys stock award arrangements among other potential impacts the stockbased compensation expense recorded in future periods and the related tax benefits may differ significantly from what was recorded in previous reporting periods 

estimates of stockbased compensation expense are significant to the companys financial statements but this expense is based on the aforementioned option valuation models and will never result in the payment of cash by the company for this reason and because the company does not view stockbased compensation as related to its operational performance the board of directors and management exclude stockbased compensation expense when evaluating the companys underlying business performance

competition 

the company believes that the principal factors affecting sales of its software include ease of use breadth and depth of functionality flexibility quality ease of integration with other software systems file compatibility across computer platforms range of supported computer platforms performance price and total cost of ownership customer service and support company reputation and financial viability and effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts 

the company continues to experience competition across all markets for its products and services some of the companys current and possible future competitors have greater financial technical marketing and other resources than the company and some have wellestablished relationships with current and potential customers of the company the companys current and possible future competitors also include firms that have or may in the future elect to compete by means of open source licensing these competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes price reductions andor increased operating costs and could result in lower revenues margins and net income 

proprietary rights and licenses 

the company regards its software as proprietary and relies on a combination of trade secret copyright patent and trademark laws license agreements nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect its proprietary rights in its products the company distributes its software products under software license agreements that grant customers nonexclusive licenses which are typically nontransferable for the use of the companys products license agreements for the companys products are directly between the company and end users use of the licensed software product is restricted to specified sites unless the customer obtains a multisite license for its use of the software product software security measures are also employed to prevent unauthorized use of the companys software products and the licensed software is subject to terms and conditions prohibiting unauthorized reproduction customers may purchase a perpetual license of the technology with the right to annually purchase ongoing maintenance technical support and upgrades or may lease the product on a fixedterm basis for a fee that includes the license maintenance technical support and upgrades 

the company licenses its software products utilizing a combination of webbased and hardcopy license terms and forms for certain software products the company primarily relies on clickwrapped licenses the enforceability of these types of agreements under the laws of some jurisdictions is uncertain 

the company also seeks to protect the source code of its software as a trade secret and as unpublished copyrighted work the company has obtained federal trademark registration protection for ansys and other marks in the us and foreign countries additionally the company was awarded numerous patents by the us patent and trademark office and has a number of patent applications pending to the extent the company does not choose to seek patent protection for its intellectual property the company primarily relies on the protection of its source code as a trade secret 

employees of the company have signed agreements under which they have agreed not to disclose trade secrets or confidential information these agreements where legally permitted restrict engagement in or connection with any business that is competitive with the company anywhere in the world while employed by the company and in some cases for specified periods thereafter and state that any products or technology created by employees during their term of employment are the property of the company in addition the company requires all channel partners to enter into agreements not to disclose the companys trade secrets and other proprietary information 

despite these precautions there can be no assurance that misappropriation of the companys technology and proprietary information including source code will be prevented further there can be no assurance that copyright trademark patent and trade secret protection will be available for the companys products in certain jurisdictions or that restrictions on the ability of employees and channel partners to engage in activities competitive with the company will be enforceable costly and timeconsuming litigation could be necessary in the future to enforce the companys rights to its trade secrets and proprietary 

information or to enforce its patent rights and copyrights and it is possible that in the future the companys competitors may be able to obtain the companys trade secrets or to independently develop similar unpatented technology 

the software development industry is characterized by rapid technological change therefore the company believes that factors such as the technological and creative skills of its personnel new product developments frequent product enhancements name recognition and reliable product maintenance are also important to establishing and maintaining technology leadership in addition to the various legal protections of its technology that may be available 

the company does not believe that any of its products infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties there can be no assurance however that third parties will not claim such infringement by the company or its licensors or licensees with respect to current or future products the company expects that software suppliers will increasingly be subject to the risk of such claims as the number of products and suppliers continues to expand and the functionality of products continues to increase any such claims with or without merit could be time consuming result in costly litigation cause product release delays or require the company to enter into royalty or licensing agreements such royalty or licensing agreements if required may not be available on terms acceptable to the company 

seasonal variations 

the companys business has experienced seasonality including quarterly reductions in software sales resulting from slowdowns of customer activities during the summer months particularly in europe as well as from the seasonal purchasing and budgeting patterns of the companys global customers the companys revenue is typically highest in the fourth quarter 

deferred revenue and backlog 

deferred revenue consists of billings made or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from software license and maintenance agreements the deferred revenue on the companys consolidated balance sheets does not represent the total value of annual or multiyear noncancellable software license and maintenance agreements the companys backlog represents installment billings for periods beyond the current quarterly billing cycle and custom er orders received but not processed the companys deferred revenue and backlog as of december 31 2015  and 2014  consisted of the following 





revenue associated with deferred revenue and backlog that will be recognized in the subsequent twelve months is classified as current in the table above 

employees 

as of december 31 2015  the company employed approximately 2800  people at that date there were also contract personnel and coop students providing ongoing development services and technical support certain employees of the company are subject to collective bargaining agreements and have local work councils 

acquisitions 

the company makes targeted acquisitions in order to support its longterm strategic direction accelerate innovation provide increased capabilities to its existing products supply new products and services expand its customer base and enhance its distribution channels 

the company completed various acquisitions during the year ended december 31 2015  to accelerate the development of new and innovative products to the marketplace while lowering design and engineering costs for customers these acquisitions were not individually significant the combined purchase price of the acquisitions was approximately 497 million  which included cash and equity 

during the years ended december 31 2014  and 2013  the combined purchase price for acquisitions was 1040 million  and 81 million  respectively the acquisitions during these years are further described in the table below

risk factors 

tableend information provided by the company or its spokespersons including information contained in this annual report on form 10k may from time to time contain forwardlooking statements concerning projected financial performance market and industry sector growth product development and commercialization or other aspects of future operations such statements will be based on the assumptions and expectations of the companys management at the time such statements are made the company cautions investors that its performance and therefore any forwardlooking statement is subject to risks and uncertainties various important factors including but not limited to the following may cause the companys future results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statement 

global economic conditions   the companys operations and performance depend significantly on foreign and domestic economic conditions uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment as well as geopolitical conditions have resulted in significant volatility in credit equity and foreign currency markets this volatility and the related economic conditions may 

negatively impact the company as customers defer spending in response to tighter credit higher unemployment financial market volatility government austerity programs negative financial news declining valuations of investments and other factors in addition certain of the companys customers budgets may be constrained and they may be unable to purchase the companys products at the same level as they have in prior periods customer spending levels may be impacted by decreased government spending in certain countries as concerns continue regarding economic conditions and government debt levels these conditions may persist or further deteriorate for an extended period of time as the global economy continues to experience volatility the company may be exposed to impairments of certain assets as their values deteriorate 

tighter credit due to economic conditions may diminish the companys future borrowing ability the companys customers ability to pay for the companys products and services may also be impaired which may lead to an increase in the companys allowance for doubtful accounts and writeoffs of accounts receivable since the company is exposed to the majority of major world markets uncertainty in any significant market may negatively impact the companys performance and results particularly with respect to the companys largest geographic customer bases the company is unable to predict the likely duration and severity of changing economic conditions or the likelihood of additional uncertainty arising in any of the companys key markets should these economic conditions result in the company not meeting its revenue growth objectives the companys operating results cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 

decline in customers businesses   the companys sales are based significantly on enduser demand for products in key industrial sectors many of these sectors periodically experience economic declines which may be exacerbated by other economic factors these factors may also adversely affect the companys business by extending sales cycles and reducing revenue these economic factors may cause the companys customers to reduce the size of their workforce or cut back on operations and may lead to a reduction in renewals of licenses or maintenance contracts with the company the companys customers may request discounts or extended payment terms on new products or seek to extend payment terms on existing contracts all of which may cause fluctuations in the companys future operating results the company may not be able to adjust its operating expenses to offset such fluctuations because a substantial portion of the companys operating expenses is related to personnel facilities and marketing programs the level of personnel and related expenses may not be able to be adjusted quickly and is based in significant part on the companys expectation for future revenue 

risks associated with international activities a majority of the companys business comes from outside the united states and the company has customers that supply a wide spectrum of goods and services in virtually all of the worlds major economic regions as the company continues to expand its sales presence in international regions the portion of its revenue expenses cash accounts receivable and payment obligations denominated in foreign currencies continues to increase if any of the foreign economies in which the company does business deteriorate or suffer periods of uncertainty the companys business and performance may be negatively impacted through reduced customer spending changes in purchasing cycles or timing reduced access to credit for its customers or other factors impacting the companys international sales and collections the companys results may also be negatively impacted by geopolitical tensions which may result in increased economic volatility 

as a result of its increasing international activities the company has revenue expenses cash accounts receivable and payment obligations denominated in foreign currencies as a result the company is subject to currency exchange risk the companys revenues and operating results are adversely affected when the us dollar strengthens relative to other currencies and are positively affected when the us dollar weakens as a result changes in currency exchange rates will affect the companys financial position results of operations and cash flows in the event that there are economic declines in countries in which the company conducts transactions the resulting changes in currency exchange rates may affect the companys financial position results of operations and cash flows the company is most impacted by movements in and among the euro japanese yen south korean won british pound canadian dollar indian rupee and us dollar the company seeks to reduce currency exchange transaction risks primarily through its normal operating and treasury activities but there can be no assurance that it will be successful in reducing these risks 

additional risks inherent in the companys international business activities include imposition of government controls export license requirements restrictions on the export of critical technology products and services the violation of anticorruption laws and regulations which are applicable to the company by third parties in countries where such conduct may be permissible or commonplace political and economic instability trade restrictions changes in tariffs and taxes difficulties in staffing and managing international operations changes in data privacy regulations longer accounts receivable payment cycles and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations effective patent copyright trademark and trade secret protection may not be available in every foreign country in which the company sells its products and services the companys business financial position results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks 

sales forecasts  the company makes many operational and strategic decisions based upon short and longterm sales forecasts the companys sales personnel continually monitor the status of all proposals including the estimated closing date and the value of the sale in order to forecast quarterly sales these forecasts are subject to significant estimation and are impacted by many external factors including global economic conditions and the performance of the companys customers a variation in actual sales activity from that forecasted could cause the company to plan or budget incorrectly and therefore could adversely affect the companys business financial position results of operations and cash flows the companys management team forecasts macroeconomic trends and developments and integrates them through longrange planning into budgets research and development strategies and a wide variety of general management duties global economic conditions and the effect those conditions and other disruptions in global markets have on the companys customers may have a significant impact on the accuracy of the companys sales forecasts these conditions may increase the likelihood or the magnitude of variations between actual sales activity and the companys sales forecasts and as a result the companys performance may be hindered because of a failure to properly match corporate strategy with economic conditions this in turn may adversely affect the companys business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

stock market and stock price volatility  market prices for securities of software companies have generally been volatile in particular the market price of the companys common stock has been and may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations as a result of factors affecting the company the software industry or the securities markets in general such factors include but are not limited to declines in trading price that may be triggered by the companys failure to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors moreover the trading price could be subject to additional fluctuations in response to quartertoquarter variations in the companys operating results material announcements made by the company or its competitors conditions in the financial markets or the software industry generally or other events and factors many of which are beyond the companys control 

rapidly changing technology new products risk of product errors the company operates in an industry generally characterized by rapidly changing technology and frequent new product introductions which can render existing products obsolete or unmarketable a major factor in the companys future success will be its ability to anticipate technological changes and to develop and introduce in a timely manner enhancements to its existing products products acquired in acquisitions and new products to meet those changes if the company is unable to introduce new products and to respond quickly to industry changes its business financial position results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

the introduction and marketing of new or enhanced products require the company to manage the transition from existing products in order to minimize disruption in customer purchasing patterns there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing and marketing on a timely basis new products or product enhancements that the new products will adequately address the changing needs of the marketplace or that the company will successfully manage the transition from existing products software products as complex as those offered by the company may contain undetected errors when first introduced or as new versions are released and the likelihood of errors is increased as a result of the companys commitment to the frequency of its product releases there can be no assurance that errors will not be found in any new or enhanced products after the commencement of commercial shipments certain products require a higher level of sales and support expertise the ability of the companys sales channel particularly the indirect channel to obtain this expertise and to sell the new product offerings effectively could have an adverse impact on the companys sales in future periods any of these problems may result in the loss of or delay in customer acceptance diversion of development resources damage to the companys reputation or increased service and warranty costs any of which could have a material adverse effect on the companys business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

product quality the company has separate quality systems and registrations under the iso 90012008 standard in addition to other governmental and industrial regulations the companys continued compliance with quality standards and favorable outcomes in periodic examinations is important to retain current customers and vital to procure new sales if the company was determined not to be compliant with various regulatory or iso 90019000 standards its certificates of registration could be suspended requiring remedial action and a timeconsuming reregistration process product quality issues or failures could result in the companys reputation becoming diminished resulting in a material adverse impact on revenue operating margins net income financial position and cash flows 

competition  the company continues to experience competition across all markets for its products and services some of the companys current and possible future competitors have greater financial technical marketing and other resources than the company and some have wellestablished relationships with current and potential customers of the company the companys current and possible future competitors also include firms that have competed or may in the future elect to compete by means of open source licensing parties among the companys current or future strategic alliances may diminish or sever technical software development and marketing relationships with the company for competitive purposes these competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes price reductions andor increased operating costs and could result in lower revenues margins and net income 

changes in the companys pricing models the intense competition the company faces in the sales of its products and services and general economic and business conditions can put pressure on the company to adjust its prices if the companys competitors offer deep discounts on certain products or services or develop products that the marketplace considers more valuable the company may need to lower prices or offer discounts or other favorable terms in order to compete successfully any such changes may reduce operating margins and could adversely affect operating results the companys maintenance products which include software license updates and product support fees are generally priced as a percentage of its new software license fees the companys competitors may offer lower percentage pricing on product updates and support that could put pressure on the company to further discount its new license or product support prices 

any broadbased change to the companys prices and pricing policies could cause new software license and service revenues to decline or be delayed as its sales force implements and its customers adjust to the new pricing policies some of the companys competitors may bundle software products for promotional purposes or as a longterm pricing strategy or provide guarantees of prices product implementations or wider geographical license usage provisions these practices could over time significantly constrain the prices that the company can charge for certain products if the company does not adapt its pricing models to reflect changes in customer use of its products or changes in customer demand the companys new software license revenues could decrease additionally increased distribution of applications through application service providers including softwareasaservice providers may reduce the average price for the companys products or adversely affect other sales of the companys products reducing new software license revenues unless the company can offset price reductions with volume increases the increase in open source software distribution may also cause the company to adjust its pricing models 

dependence on senior management and key technical personnel  the companys success depends upon the continued services of the companys senior executives key technical employees and other employees each of the companys executive officers key technical personnel and other employees could terminate his or her relationship with the company at any time the loss of any of the companys senior executives might significantly delay or prevent the achievement of the companys business objectives and could materially harm the companys business and customer relationships 

in addition because of the highly technical nature of the companys products the company must attract and retain highly skilled engineering and development personnel many of whom are recruited from outside of the united states the market for this talent is highly competitive the company is limited in its ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws if the company has less success in recruiting and retaining key personnel the companys business reputation and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 

dependence on proprietary technology  the companys success is highly dependent upon its proprietary technology the company generally relies on contracts and the laws of copyrights patents trademarks and trade secrets to protect its technology the company maintains a trade secrets program enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees and channel partners and limits access to and distribution of its software documentation and other proprietary information there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company to protect its proprietary technology will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of its technology by third parties or that third parties will not be able to develop similar technology independently costly and timeconsuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of trade secret rights and related confidentiality and nondisclosure provisions although the company is not aware that any of its technology infringes upon the rights of third parties there can be no assurance that other parties will not assert technology infringement claims against the company or that if asserted such claims will not prevail 

risks associated with security of the companys products source code and it systems the company makes significant efforts to maintain and improve the security and integrity of its products source code computer systems and data despite significant efforts to create security barriers to such programs it is virtually impossible for the company to entirely mitigate this risk there appears to be an increasing number of computer “hackers” developing and deploying a variety of destructive software programs such as viruses worms and the like that could attack the companys products and computer systems because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to networks or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target the company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures like all software products the companys software is vulnerable to such attacks the impact of such an attack could disrupt the proper functioning of the companys software products cause errors in the output of its customers work allow unauthorized access to sensitive proprietary or confidential information of the company or its customers and result in other destructive outcomes if this were to occur the companys reputation may suffer customers may stop buying products the company could face lawsuits and potential liability and the companys financial performance could be negatively impacted 

there is also a danger of industrial espionage cyberattacks misuse theft of information or assets including source code or damage to assets by people who have gained unauthorized access to the companys facilities systems or information such cybersecurity breaches misuse or other disruptions could lead to the disclosure of portions of the companys product source code or other confidential information improper usage and distribution of the companys products without compensation illegal usage of the companys products which could jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through its computer systems and theft manipulation and destruction of private and proprietary data resulting in defective products and production downtimes although the company actively employs measures to combat unlicensed copying access and use of software and intellectual property through a variety of techniques preventing unauthorized use or infringement of the companys rights is inherently difficult these events could adversely affect the companys financial results or could result in significant claims for damages against it participating in lawsuits to protect against any such unauthorized access to usage of or disclosure of any of the companys products or any portion of the companys product source code or in prosecutions in connection with any such cybersecurity breach could be costly and timeconsuming and may divert managements attention and adversely affect the markets perception of the company and its products 

policing the unauthorized distribution and use of the companys products is difficult and software piracy including online piracy is a persistent problem the proliferation of technology designed to circumvent typical software protection measures used in the companys products and the possibility of methods that circumvent the techniques it employs in its products may lead to an expansion in piracy or misuse of its products and intellectual property as a result and despite the companys efforts to prevent such activities and to prosecute instances of such activities the company may nonetheless lose significant revenue due to illegal use of its software and managements attention may be diverted to address specific instances of piracy or misuse or to address piracy and misuse in general 

a number of the companys core processes such as software development sales and marketing customer service and financial transactions rely on its it infrastructure and applications the company also relies upon thirdparty products which are exposed to various security vulnerabilities malicious software sabotage and other cybersecurity breaches of the types discussed above could cause an outage of the companys infrastructure which could lead to a substantial denial of service and ultimately to production downtime recovery costs and customer claims this could have a significant negative impact on the companys business financial position profit and cash flows 

the company has implemented a number of measures designed to ensure the security of its information it resources and other assets nonetheless unauthorized users could gain access to its systems through cyberattacks and steal use without authorization and sabotage the companys intellectual property and confidential data any breach of its it security misuse or theft could lead to loss of production recovery costs or litigation brought by employees customers or business partners which could have a significant negative impact on the companys business financial position profit cash flows and reputation 

dependence on channel partners  the company continues to distribute a meaningful portion of its products through its global network of independent regional channel partners the channel partners sell the companys software products to new and existing customers expand installations within the existing customer base offer consulting services and provide the first line of technical support consequently in certain geographies the company is highly dependent upon the efforts of the channel partners difficulties in ongoing relationships with channel partners such as failure to meet performance criteria or to promote the companys products as aggressively as the company expects and differences in the handling of customer relationships could adversely affect the companys performance additionally the loss of any major channel partner for any reason including a channel partners decision to sell competing products rather than the companys products could have a material adverse effect on the company moreover the companys future success will depend substantially on the ability and willingness of its channel partners to continue to dedicate the resources necessary to promote the companys portfolio of products and to support a larger installed base of the companys products if the channel partners are unable or unwilling to do so the company may be unable to sustain revenue growth 

the company has been increasing its number of channel partners particularly in international locations the business relationships with these channel partners are recently established and could result in additional compliance burdens for the company these partners also have a lessestablished payment history with the company and revenue from these partners could come with a higher rate of bad debt expense 

during times of significant fluctuations in world currencies certain channel partners may have solvency issues to the extent that effective hedge transactions are not employed or there is not sufficient working capital in particular if the us dollar strengthens relative to other currencies certain channel partners who pay the company in us dollars may have trouble paying the company on time or may have trouble distributing the companys products due to the impact of the currency exchange fluctuation on such channel partners cash flows this may impact the companys ability to distribute its products into certain regions and markets and may have an adverse effect on the companys results of operations and cash flows 

reliance on perpetual licenses  although the company has historically maintained stable recurring revenue from the sale of software lease licenses and software maintenance subscriptions it also has relied on sales of perpetual licenses that involve the payment of a single upfront fee historically these licenses have been more typical in the computer software industry and remain as the preferred licensing approach in certain markets while revenue generated from software lease licenses and software maintenance subscriptions currently represents a portion of the companys revenue to the extent that perpetual license revenue continues to represent a significant percentage of total revenue the companys revenue in any period will depend significantly on sales completed during that period if customer purchasing patterns shift toward a stronger preference for lease licenses and fewer perpetual licenses there could be a shortterm adverse impact on the companys revenue and profitability 

in addition the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 effective for annual periods beginning after december 15 2017 which   supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance including industryspecific guidance this update could affect the timing and amounts of revenue recognized for perpetual licenses which could have an adverse impact on the companys revenue and results of operations 

renewal rates for annual lease and maintenance contracts a substantial portion of the companys license and maintenance revenue is derived from annual lease and maintenance contracts these contracts are generally renewed on an annual basis and typically have a high rate of customer renewal in addition to the recurring revenue base associated with these contracts a majority of customers purchasing new perpetual licenses also purchase related annual maintenance contracts if the rate of renewal for these contracts is adversely affected by economic or other factors the companys license and maintenance growth will be adversely affected over the term that the revenue for those contracts would have otherwise been recognized as a result the companys business financial position results of operations and cash flows may also be adversely impacted during those periods 

risks associated with acquisitions historically the company has consummated acquisitions in order to support the companys longterm strategic direction accelerate innovation provide increased capabilities to existing products supply new products and services expand its customer base and enhance its distribution channels the company has completed a number of acquisitions in recent years and expects to make additional acquisitions in the future but may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or if suitable candidates are identified the company may not be able to complete the business combination on commercially acceptable terms the process of exploring and pursuing acquisition opportunities may result in devotion of significant management and financial resources 

even if the company is able to consummate acquisitions that it believes will be successful such transactions present many risks including among others difficulty in integrating the management teams strategies cultures and operations of the companies failing to achieve anticipated synergies and revenue increases difficulty incorporating and integrating the acquired technologies or products with the companys existing product lines difficulty in coordinating establishing or expanding sales distribution and marketing functions as necessary difficulty in training the global sales team to sell the acquired products failure to develop new products and services that utilize the technologies and resources of the companies disruption of the companys ongoing business and diversion of managements attention to transition or integration issues unanticipated and unknown liabilities the loss of key employees customers partners and channel partners of the company or of the acquired company resulting in the loss of key information expertise or knowhow and unanticipated additional recruitment and training costs and difficulties implementing and maintaining sufficient controls policies and procedures over the systems products and processes of the acquired company if the company does not achieve the anticipated benefits of its acquisitions as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by the companys management and financial or industry analysts there could be a material adverse effect on the companys stock price business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

in addition for companies acquired limited experience will exist for several quarters following the acquisition relating to how the acquired companys sales pipelines will convert into sales or revenues and the conversion rate postacquisition may be quite different than the historical conversion rate because a substantial portion of the companys sales are completed in the latter part of a quarter and its cost structure is largely fixed in the shortterm revenue shortfalls may have a negative impact on the companys profitability a delay in a small number of large new software license transactions could cause the companys quarterly software license revenues to fall significantly short of its predictions 

the company may periodically be involved in business combinations with enterprises that are developmental in nature while these entities have leadingedge technology they may not have developed direct or indirect distribution channels and may not have software revenues which cover the ongoing expenses therefore the company may have a decrease in operating margin and profitability while these types of acquisitions are integrated and the distribution channel incorporates the new product offerings 

disruption of operations or infrastructure failures  a significant portion of the companys software development personnel source code and computer equipment is located at operating facilities in the united states canada india japan and throughout europe the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unforeseen catastrophe at any of these facilities could cause interruptions in the companys operations services and product development activities additionally if the company experiences problems that impair its business infrastructure such as a computer virus telephone system failure or an intentional disruption of its information technology systems by a third party these interruptions could have a material adverse effect on the companys business financial position results of operations cash flows and the ability to meet financial reporting deadlines further because the companys sales are not generally linear during any quarterly period the potential adverse effects resulting from any of the events described above or any other disruption of the companys business could be accentuated if it occurs close to the end of a fiscal quarter 

risks associated with significant sales to existing customers  a significant portion of the companys sales includes followon sales to existing customers that invest in the companys broad suite of engineering simulation software and services if a significant number of current customers were to become dissatisfied with the companys products and services or choose to license or utilize competitive offerings the companys followon sales and recurring lease and maintenance revenues could be materially adversely impacted resulting in reduced revenue operating margins net income and cash flows 

periodic reorganization of sales force  the company relies heavily on its direct sales force from time to time the company reorganizes and makes adjustments to its sales leadership andor its sales force in response to such factors as management changes performance issues market opportunities and other considerations these changes may result in a temporary lack of sales production and may adversely impact revenue in future quarters there can be no assurance that the company will not restructure its sales force in future periods or that the transition issues associated with such a restructuring will not occur 

income tax estimates  the company makes significant estimates in determining its worldwide income tax provision these estimates involve complex tax regulations in a number of jurisdictions across the companys global operations and are subject to many transactions and calculations in which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain the final outcome of tax matters could be different than the estimates reflected in the historical income tax provision and related accruals such differences could have a material impact on income tax expense and net income in the periods in which such determinations are made 

the amount of income tax paid by the company is subject to ongoing audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities these audits can result in additional assessments including interest and penalties the companys estimate for liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions is highly judgmental and actual future outcomes may result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to the companys estimated tax liabilities including estimates for uncertain tax positions in the period the assessments are made or resolved audits are closed or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire as a result the companys effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly or annual basis 

the company allocates a portion of its purchase price to goodwill and intangible assets impairment charges associated with goodwill are generally not taxdeductible and will result in an increased effective income tax rate in the period the impairment is recorded the company has recorded significant deferred tax liabilities related to acquired intangible assets that are not deductible for tax purposes these deferred tax liabilities are based on future statutory tax rates in the locations in which the intangible assets are recorded any future changes in statutory tax rates would be recorded as an adjustment to the deferred tax liabilities in the period the change is announced and could have a material impact on the companys effective tax rate during that period 

regulatory compliance  like all other public companies the company is subject to the rules and regulations of the sec including those that require the company to report on and receive an attestation from its independent registered public accounting firm regarding the companys internal control over financial reporting compliance with these requirements causes the company to incur additional expenses and causes management to divert time from the daytoday operations of the company while the company anticipates being able to fully comply with these requirements if it is not able to comply with the reporting or attestation requirements relating to internal control over financial reporting the company may be subject to sanctions by the sec or nasdaq such sanctions could divert the attention of the companys management from implementing its business plan and could have an adverse effect on the companys business and results of operations 

as the companys stock is listed on the nasdaq global select market the company is subject to the ongoing financial and corporate governance requirements of nasdaq while the company anticipates being able to fully comply with these requirements if it is not able to comply the companys name may be published on nasdaqs daily noncompliant companies list until nasdaq determines that it has regained compliance or the company no longer trades on nasdaq if the company were unable to return to compliance with the governance requirements of nasdaq the company may be delisted from the nasdaq global select market which could have an adverse effect on the market value of the companys equity securities and the ability to raise additional capital 

governmental revenue sources the companys sales to the united states government must comply with federal acquisition regulations failure to comply with these regulations could result in penalties being assessed against the company or an order preventing the company from making future sales to the united states government further the companys international activities must comply with the export control laws of the united states and other countries the foreign corrupt practices act the united kingdom bribery act of 2010 and a variety of other laws and regulations of the united states and other countries in which the company operates failure to comply with any of these laws and regulations could adversely affect the companys business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

in certain circumstances the united states government state and local governments and their respective agencies and certain foreign governments may have the right to terminate contractual arrangements at any time without cause the united states european union and certain other government contracts as well as the companys state and local level contracts are subject to the approval of appropriations or funding authorizations certain of these contracts permit the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions including but not limited to termination of contracts refund of a portion of fees received forfeiture of profits suspension of payments fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business any of which could have an adverse effect on the companys results of operations and cash flows 

contingencies  the company is subject to various investigations claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business including commercial disputes labor and employment matters tax audits alleged infringement of intellectual property rights and other matters each of these matters is subject to various uncertainties and it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could materially affect the companys results of operations cash flows and financial position 

changes in existing financial accounting standards changes in existing accounting rules or practices new accounting pronouncements or varying interpretations of current accounting pronouncements could have a significant adverse effect on the companys results of operations or the manner in which the company conducts its business 

in may 2014 the fasb issued accounting standards update no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606  asu 201409 asu 201409 effective for annual periods beginning after december 15 2017 supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance including industryspecific guidance the company is currently evaluating the effect that implementation of this update will have on its financial results upon adoption this update will impact the timing and amounts of revenue recognized including a potential impact on transactions completed prior to adoption which could have a significant adverse impact on the companys results of operations 

in addition the company could incur significant costs for changes to its business systems processes and internal controls as a result of the transition these costs could have a significant adverse impact on the companys results of operations and cash flows the transition could also cause management to divert time from the daytoday operations of the company which could impact the companys business if the company is unable to successfully transition its business systems processes and internal controls before the guidance effective date it could impact the ability to meet financial reporting deadlines 

changes in tax law the companys operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions a change in the tax law in the jurisdictions in which the company does business including an increase in tax rates an adverse change in the treatment of an item of income or expense or a decrease in tax rates in a jurisdiction in which the company has significant deferred tax assets could result in a material increase in tax expense currently a substantial portion of the companys revenue is generated from customers located outside the united states and a substantial portion of assets are located outside the united states united states income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings for nonunited states subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries changes in existing taxation rules or practices new taxation rules or varying interpretations of current taxation practices could have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations or the manner in which the company conducts its business 

the company has significant operations in india there have been court rulings concerning certain indian tax laws that have been inconsistent with tax positions taken by the company and inconsistent with the advice provided to the company by its tax advisors 

an indian subsidiary of the company received a formal inquiry after a service tax audit was held in 2011 the company could incur tax charges and related liabilities including those related to the service tax audit case of approximately 6 million  the service tax issues raised in the companys notice are very similar to the case ms microsoft corporation i p ltd vs commissioner of service tax  new delhi  wherein the delhi customs excise and service tax appellate tribunal cestat has passed a ruling favorable to microsoft the company can provide no assurances on whether the microsoft cases favorable ruling will be challenged in higher courts or on the impact that the present microsoft cases decision will have on the companys audit case the company is uncertain as to when the service tax audit will be completed 

other court cases are pending in india that could have a material impact on the companys financial position results of operations and cash flows if the ultimate outcome of those cases is similarly inconsistent with tax positions taken by the company

acquisitions 

the company completed various acquisitions during the year ended december 31 2015  to accelerate the development of new and innovative products to the marketplace while lowering design and engineering costs for customers these acquisitions were not individually significant the combined purchase price of the acquisitions was approximately 497 million  which included cash and equity

for further information on the companys business combinations see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k 

results of operations 

for purposes of the following discussion and analysis the table below sets forth certain consolidated financial data for the years 2015  2014  and 2013  the operating results of the companys acquisitions have been included in the results of operations since their respective acquisition dates 



year ended december 31 2015  compared to year ended december 31 2014 

revenue 



the companys revenue increased 07  during the year ended december 31 2015  as compared to the year ended december 31 2014  the growth rate was adversely impacted by 70  due to a strengthening us dollar and would have been 78  at currency exchange rates that were in effect for 2014  the growth rate was favorably impacted by the companys continued investment in its global sales support and marketing organizations annual maintenance contracts that were sold with new perpetual licenses along with maintenance contracts sold with new perpetual licenses in previous years contributed to maintenance revenue growth of 52  this growth was primarily due to maintenance contracts sold with electronics products perpetual license revenue which is derived primarily from new sales decreased 31  as compared to the prior year while lease licenses perpetual licenses and service revenue declined as compared to the prior year all were higher in constant currency 

with respect to revenue on average for the year ended december 31 2015  the us dollar was 125  stronger when measured against the companys primary foreign currencies than for the year ended december 31 2014  the net overall strengthening resulted in decreased revenue of 659 million  during the year ended december 31 2015  as compared to the year ended december 31 2014  the impact on revenue was primarily driven by 427 million  146 million  29 million  and 29 million  of adverse impact due to a weakening euro japanese yen south korean won and british pound respectively the net overall strengthening of the us dollar also resulted in decreased operating income of 380 million  during the year ended december 31 2015  as compared to the year ended december 31 2014  

a substantial portion of the companys license and maintenance revenue is derived from annual lease and maintenance contracts these contracts are generally renewed on an annual basis and typically have a high rate of customer renewal in addition to the recurring revenue base associated with these contracts a majority of customers purchasing new perpetual licenses also purchase related annual maintenance contracts as a result of the significant recurring revenue base the companys license and maintenance revenue growth rate in any period does not necessarily correlate to the growth rate of new license and maintenance contracts sold during that period to the extent the rate of customer renewal for lease and maintenance contracts is high incremental lease contracts and maintenance contracts sold with new perpetual licenses will result in license and maintenance revenue growth in constant currency conversely if the rate of renewal for these contracts is adversely affected by economic or other factors the companys license and maintenance growth will be adversely affected over the term that the revenue for those contracts would have otherwise been recognized 

the company is starting to experience an increased interest by its customers in enterprise license agreements that often include longerterm timebased licenses involving a larger number of the companys software products while these arrangements typically involve a higher overall transaction price the revenue from these contracts is typically deferred and recognized over the period of the contract resulting in increased deferred revenue and backlog to the extent these types of contracts replace sales of perpetual licenses there could be a nearterm adverse impact on software license and maintenance revenue growth 

international and domestic revenues as a percentage of total revenue were 624  and 376  respectively during the year ended december 31 2015  and 658  and 342  respectively during the year ended december 31 2014  the company derived 242  and 249  of its total revenue through the indirect sales channel for the years ended december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively 

in valuing deferred revenue on the balance sheets of the companys recent acquisitions as of their respective acquisition dates the company applied the fair value provisions applicable to the accounting for business combinations resulting in a reduction of deferred revenue as compared to its historical carrying amount as a result the companys postacquisition revenue will be 

less than the sum of what would have otherwise been reported by ansys and each acquiree absent the acquisitions the impact on reported revenue for the year ended december 31 2015  was 17 million

revenue 



the companys revenue increased 87 during the year ended december 31 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31 2013 including increases in all major revenue categories the growth rate was adversely impacted by 09 due to a strengthening us dollar and would have been 96 at currency exchange rates that were in effect for 2013 the growth rate was favorably impacted by the companys continued investment in its global sales and marketing organizations revenue from lease licenses increased 68 as compared to the prior year due primarily to growth in lease license revenue of power analysis and electronics products perpetual license revenue which is derived primarily from new sales increased 66 as compared to the prior year annual maintenance contracts that were sold with new perpetual licenses along with maintenance contracts sold with new perpetual licenses in previous years contributed to maintenance revenue growth of 122 

with respect to revenue on average for the year ended december 31 2014 the us dollar was 16 stronger when measured against the companys primary foreign currencies than for the year ended december 31 2013 the net overall strengthening resulted in decreased revenue of 76 million during the year ended december 31 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31 2013 the impact on revenue was primarily driven by 98 million of adverse impact due to a weakening japanese yen partially offset by 19 million of favorable impact due to a strengthening british pound the net overall strengthening of the us dollar also resulted in decreased operating income of 51 million during the year ended december 31 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31 2013

interest expense  the companys interest expense consists of the following 



other expense net  the companys other expense consists of the following 



income tax provision  the company recorded income tax expense of 934 million and had income before income taxes of 3481 million for the year ended december 31 2014 representing an effective tax rate of 268 during the year ended december 31 2013 the company recorded income tax expense of 772 million and had income before income taxes of 3225 million representing an effective tax rate of 239 

in december 2013 the company received notice from the irs that the joint committee on taxation took no exception to the companys tax returns that were filed for 2009 and 2010 an 110 million tax benefit was recognized in the companys 2013 financial results as the company had effectively settled uncertainty regarding the realization of refund claims filed in connection with the 2009 and 2010 returns 

in the us which is the largest jurisdiction where the company receives such a tax credit the availability of the research and development credit expired at the end of the 2011 tax year in january 2013 the us congress passed legislation that reinstated the research and development credit retroactive to 2012 the income tax provision for the year ended december 31 2013 includes approximately 23 million related to the reinstated research and development credit for 2012 activity the research and development credit also expired at the end of the 2013 tax year but the us congress reinstated the credit in december 2014 for the 2014 tax year

nongaap results 

the company provides nongaap revenue nongaap operating income nongaap operating profit margin nongaap net income and nongaap diluted earnings per share as supplemental measures to gaap regarding the companys operational performance these financial measures exclude the impact of certain items and therefore have not been calculated in accordance with gaap a detailed explanation and a reconciliation of each nongaap financial measure to its most comparable gaap financial measure are described below 

 36 



 note the 2013 gaap and nongaap net income and earnings per share data reflected above include 110 million of incremental tax benefits or 012 per diluted share related to the notification received from the irs that the joint committee on taxation took no exception to the companys tax returns that were filed for 2009 and 2010 thus effectively settling the uncertainty regarding refund claims filed in connection with those returns 

nongaap measures 

management uses nongaap financial measures a to evaluate the companys historical and prospective financial performance as well as its performance relative to its competitors b to set internal sales targets and spending budgets c to allocate resources d to measure operational profitability and the accuracy of forecasting e to assess financial discipline over operational expenditures and f as an important factor in determining variable compensation for management and its employees in addition many financial analysts that follow the company focus on and publish both historical results and future projections based on nongaap financial measures the company believes that it is in the best interest of its investors to provide this information to analysts so that they accurately report the nongaap financial information moreover investors have historically requested and the company has historically reported these nongaap financial measures as a means of providing consistent and comparable information with past reports of financial results 

while management believes that these nongaap financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors there are limitations associated with the use of these nongaap financial measures these nongaap financial measures are not prepared in accordance with gaap are not reported by all of the companys competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of the companys competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation the company compensates for these limitations by using these nongaap financial measures as supplements to gaap financial measures and by reviewing the reconciliations of the nongaap financial measures to their most comparable gaap financial measures 

the adjustments to these nongaap financial measures and the basis for such adjustments are outlined below 

acquisition accounting for deferred revenue and its related tax impact historically the company has consummated acquisitions in order to support its strategic and other business objectives in accordance with the fair value provisions applicable to the accounting for business combinations acquired deferred revenue is often recorded on the opening balance sheet at an amount that is lower than the historical carrying value although this acquisition accounting requirement has no impact on the companys business or cash flow it adversely impacts the companys reported gaap revenue in the reporting periods following an acquisition in order to provide investors with financial information that facilitates comparison of both historical and future results the company provides nongaap financial measures which exclude the impact of the acquisition accounting adjustment the company believes that this nongaap financial adjustment is useful to investors because it allows investors to a evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in its financial and operational decisionmaking and b compare past and future reports of financial results of the company as the revenue reduction related to acquired deferred revenue will not recur when related annual lease licenses and software maintenance contracts are renewed in future periods 

amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions and its related tax impact the company incurs amortization of intangible assets included in its gaap presentation of amortization expense related to various acquisitions it has made management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating nongaap operating income nongaap operating profit margin nongaap net income and nongaap diluted earnings per share when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the company because these costs are fixed at the time of an acquisition are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition accordingly management does not consider these expenses for purposes of evaluating the performance of the company during the applicable time period after the acquisition and it excludes such expenses when making decisions to allocate resources the company believes that these nongaap financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to a evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in its financial and operational decisionmaking and b compare past reports of financial results of the company as the company has historically reported these nongaap financial measures 

stockbased compensation expense and its related tax impact  the company incurs expense related to stockbased compensation included in its gaap presentation of cost of software licenses cost of maintenance and service research and development expense and selling general and administrative expense although stockbased compensation is an expense of the company and viewed as a form of compensation management excludes these expenses for the purpose of calculating nongaap operating income nongaap operating profit margin nongaap net income and nongaap diluted earnings per share when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the company specifically the company excludes stockbased compensation during its annual budgeting process and its quarterly and annual assessments of the companys and managements performance the annual budgeting process is the primary mechanism whereby the company allocates resources to various initiatives and operational requirements additionally the annual review by the board of directors during which it compares the companys historical business model and profitability to the planned business model and profitability for the forthcoming year excludes the impact of stockbased compensation in evaluating the performance of senior management and department managers charges related to stockbased compensation are excluded from expenditure and profitability results in fact the company records stockbased compensation expense into a standalone cost center for which no single operational manager is responsible or accountable in this way management is able to review on a periodtoperiod basis each managers performance and assess financial discipline over operational expenditures without the effect of stockbased compensation the company believes that these nongaap financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to a evaluate the companys operating results and the effectiveness of the methodology used by management to review the companys operating results and b review historical comparability in the companys financial reporting as well as comparability with competitors operating results 

transaction costs related to business combinations the company incurs expenses for professional services rendered in connection with business combinations which are included in its gaap presentation of selling general and administrative expense these expenses are generally not taxdeductible management excludes these acquisitionrelated transaction expenses for the purpose of calculating nongaap operating income nongaap operating profit margin nongaap net income and nongaap diluted earnings per share when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the company as it generally would not have otherwise incurred these expenses in the periods presented as a part of its continuing operations the company believes that these nongaap financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to a evaluate the companys operating results and the effectiveness of the methodology used by management to review the companys operating results and b review historical comparability in the companys financial reporting as well as comparability with competitors operating results 

nongaap financial measures are not in accordance with or an alternative for gaap the companys nongaap financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable gaap financial measures and should be read only in conjunction with the companys consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap 

the company has provided a reconciliation of the nongaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures as listed below

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the company believes that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition  revenue is derived principally from the licensing of computer software products and from related maintenance contracts revenue from perpetual licenses is classified as license revenue and is recognized upon delivery of the licensed product and the utility that enables the customer to access authorization keys provided that acceptance has occurred and a signed contractual obligation has been received the price is fixed and determinable and collectibility of the receivable is probable the company determines the fair value of postcontract customer support pcs sold together with perpetual licenses based on the rate charged for pcs when sold separately revenue from pcs contracts is classified as maintenance and service revenue and is recognized ratably over the term of the contract 

revenue for software lease licenses is classified as license revenue and is recognized over the period of the lease contract typically the companys software leases include pcs which due to the short term principally one year or less of the companys software lease licenses cannot be separated from lease revenue for accounting purposes as a result both the lease licenses and pcs are recognized ratably over the lease period due to the shortterm nature of the software lease licenses and the frequency with which the company provides major product upgrades typically every 12–18 months the company does not believe that a significant portion of the fee paid under the arrangement is attributable to the pcs component of the arrangement and as a result includes the revenue for the entire arrangement within software license revenue in the consolidated statements of income 

many of the companys semiconductor products are typically licensed via longer term leases of 24–36 months the company recognizes revenue for these licenses over the term of the lease contract because the company does not have vendorspecific objective evidence of the fair value of these leases the company also recognizes revenue from perpetual licenses over the term of the lease contract during the infrequent occurrence of these licenses being sold with semiconductor leases in multipleelement arrangements 

revenue from training support and other services is recognized as the services are performed the company applies the specific performance method to contracts in which the service consists of a single act such as providing a training class to a customer and the proportional performance method to other service contracts that are longer in duration and often include multiple acts for example both training and consulting in applying the proportional performance method the company typically utilizes outputbased estimates for services with contractual billing arrangements that are not based on time and materials and estimates output based on the total tasks completed as compared to the total tasks required for each work contract inputbased estimates are utilized for services that involve general consultations with contractual billing arrangements based on time and materials utilizing direct labor as the input measure 

the company also executes arrangements through independent channel partners in which the channel partners are authorized to market and distribute the companys software products to end users of the companys products and services in specified territories in sales facilitated by channel partners the channel partner bears the risk of collection from the enduser customer the company recognizes revenue from transactions with channel partners when the channel partner submits a written purchase commitment collectibility from the channel partner is probable a license agreement signed by the enduser customer is received and delivery has occurred provided that all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied revenue from channel partner transactions is the amount remitted to the company by the channel partners this amount includes a fee for pcs that is compensation for providing technical enhancements and the second level of technical support to the end user which is based on the rate charged for pcs when sold separately and is recognized over the period that pcs is to be provided the company does not offer right of return product rotation or price protection to any of its channel partners 

nonincome related taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as accounts receivable and accrued expenses the collection and payment of these amounts are reported on a net basis in the consolidated statements of income and do not impact reported revenues or expenses 

the company warrants to its customers that its software will substantially perform as specified in the companys most current user manuals the company has not experienced significant claims related to software warranties beyond the scope of maintenance support which the company is already obligated to provide consequently the company has not established reserves for warranty obligations 

the companys agreements with its customers generally require it to indemnify the customer against claims that the companys software infringes thirdparty patent copyright trademark or other proprietary rights such indemnification obligations are generally limited in a variety of industrystandard respects including the companys right to replace an infringing product as of december 31 2015  the company had not experienced any losses related to these indemnification obligations and no claims with respect thereto were outstanding the company does not expect significant claims related to these indemnification obligations and consequently the company has not established any related reserves 

allowance for doubtful accounts  the company makes judgments as to its ability to collect outstanding receivables and provides allowances for a portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices from both value and delinquency perspectives for those invoices not specifically reviewed provisions are provided at differing rates based upon the age of the receivable and the geographic area of origin in determining these percentages the company considers its historical collection experience and current economic trends in the customers industry and geographic region if the historical data used to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and future results of operations could be materially affected 

income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period of the enactment date 

the company records net deferred tax assets to the extent it believes these assets will more likely than not be realized in making such determination the company considers all available positive and negative evidence including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and recent financial operations in the event the company determines that it will be able to realize deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance was used to reduce their carrying value the adjustment to the valuation allowance will be recorded as a reduction to the provision for income taxes 

tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a morelikelythannot threshold otherwise these tax benefits are recorded when a tax position has been effectively settled which means that the statute of limitations has expired or the appropriate taxing authority has completed their examination even though the statute of limitations remains open the company recognizes interest and penalties related to income taxes within the income tax expense line in the consolidated statements of income accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheets 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets the company tests goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment at least annually by performing a quantitative assessment of whether the fair value of each reporting unit or asset exceeds its carrying amount goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level and indefinitelived intangible assets are tested at the individual asset level this requires the company to assess and make judgments regarding a variety of factors which impact the fair value of the reporting unit or asset being tested including business plans anticipated future cash flows economic projections and other market data because there are inherent uncertainties involved in these factors significant differences between these estimates and actual results could result in future impairment charges and could materially impact the companys future financial results during the first quarter of 2015  the company completed the annual impairment test for goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets and determined that these assets had not been impaired as of the test date january 1 2015  the company tested a previously unamortized trade name that was determined to have a finite life for impairment during the first quarter of 2015  and determined that its fair value exceeded its carrying value so no impairment was recorded no other events or circumstances changed during the twelve months ended december 31 2015  that would indicate that the fair values of the companys reporting unit and indefinite lived intangible asset are below their carrying values 

contingencies   the company is involved in various investigations claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business including commercial disputes labor and employment matters tax audits alleged infringement of intellectual property rights and other matters the company reviews the status of these matters assesses its financial exposure and records a related accrual if the potential loss from an investigation claim or legal proceeding is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable significant judgment is involved in the determination of probability and in the determination of whether an exposure is reasonably estimable as a result of the uncertainties involved in making these estimates the company may have to revise its estimates as facts and circumstances change the revision of these estimates could have a material impact on the companys financial position and results of operations 

stockbased compensation the company grants options and other stock awards to employees and directors under the companys stock option and grant plan eligible employees can also purchase shares of the companys common stock at a discount under the companys employee stock purchase plan the benefits provided under these plans are sharebased payments subject to the provisions of sharebased payment accounting guidance the company uses the fair value method to apply the provisions of sharebased payment accounting guidance stockbased compensation expense for 2015  2014  and 2013  was 340 million  369 million  and 353 million  respectively as of december 31 2015  total unrecognized estimated compensation expense related to unvested stock options and awards granted prior to that date was 529 million  which is expected to be recognized over a weightedaverage period of 18 years  

the value of each stock option award was estimated on the date of grant or date of acquisition for options issued in a business combination using the blackscholes option pricing model “blackscholes model” the determination of the fair value of sharebased payment awards using an option pricing model is affected by the companys stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables these variables include the companys expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors riskfree interest rates and expected dividends the table below presents the weighted average input assumptions used and resulting fair values for options granted or issued in business combinations during each respective year the stockbased compensation expense for options is recorded ratably over the requisite service period the interest rate assumptions were determined by using the fiveyear us treasury note yield on the date of grant or date of acquisition   



the company issues various restricted stock awards which contain a market condition a performance condition a service condition or any combination of the three restricted stock awards are valued based on the grantdate fair value of the award stock compensation expense is recognized over the employees requisite service period for awards with only a service condition for awards with a performance condition stockbased compensation expense is recorded from the service inception date through the conclusion of the measurement period based on managements estimates concerning the probability of vesting 

vesting of restricted stock awards with a market condition is based on the companys performance as measured by total shareholder return relative to the median percentage appreciation of a specified stock index over the measurement period subject to each participants continued employment with the company through the conclusion of the measurement period the fair value of the restricted stock awards with a market condition is estimated using a monte carlo simulation model the determination of the fair value of the awards is affected by the grant date and a number of variables each of which has been identified in the chart below for awards granted during each respective period sharebased compensation expense based on the fair value of the award is being recorded from the grant date through the conclusion of the measurement period 



the company also grants deferred stock units to nonaffiliate independent directors which are rights to receive shares of common stock upon termination of service as a director the deferred stock units are issued in arrears and vest immediately 

to the extent the company changes the terms of its stockbased compensation programs experiences market volatility in the pricing of its common stock that increases the implied volatility assumption used in the blackscholes model refines different 

assumptions in future periods such as forfeiture rates that differ from current estimates or assumes stock awards from acquired companies that are different in nature than the companys stock award arrangements among other potential impacts the stockbased compensation expense recorded in future periods and the related tax benefits may differ significantly from what was recorded in previous reporting periods 

estimates of stockbased compensation expense are significant to the companys financial statements but this expense is based on the aforementioned option valuation models and will never result in the payment of cash by the company for this reason and because the company does not view stockbased compensation as related to its operational performance the board of directors and management exclude stockbased compensation expense when evaluating the companys underlying business performance

foreign currency transaction risk  as the company operates in international regions a portion of its revenue expenses cash accounts receivable and payment obligations are denominated in foreign currencies as a result changes in currency exchange rates will affect the companys financial position results of operations and cash flows the company is most impacted by movements in and among the euro japanese yen south korean won british pound canadian dollar indian rupee and us dollar 

with respect to revenue on average for the year ended december 31 2015  the us dollar was 125  stronger when measured against the companys primary foreign currencies than for the year ended december 31 2014  the net overall strengthening resulted in decreased revenue of 659 million  during the year ended december 31 2015  as compared to the year ended december 31 2014  the impact on revenue was primarily driven by 427 million  146 million  29 million  and 29 million  of adverse impact due to a weakening euro japanese yen south korean won and british pound respectively the net overall strengthening of the us dollar also resulted in decreased operating income of 380 million  during the year ended december 31 2015  as compared to the year ended december 31 2014  

the company has foreign currency denominated liabilities in order to provide a natural hedge to mitigate the foreign currency exchange risk the company will purchase foreign currencies and hold these currencies in cash until the liabilities are settled 

the most significant currency impacts on revenue and operating income are typically attributable to us dollar exchange rate changes against the british pound euro and japanese yen the exchange rates for these currencies are reflected in the charts below

the company continues to experience competition across all markets for its products and services some of the companys current and possible future competitors have greater financial technical marketing and other resources than the company and some have wellestablished relationships with current and potential customers of the company the companys current and possible future competitors also include firms that have or may in the future elect to compete by means of open source licensing these competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes price reductions andor increased operating costs and could result in lower revenues margins and net income 

proprietary rights and licenses 

the company regards its software as proprietary and relies on a combination of trade secret copyright patent and trademark laws license agreements nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect its proprietary rights in its products the company distributes its software products under software license agreements that grant customers nonexclusive licenses which are typically nontransferable for the use of the companys products license agreements for the companys products are directly between the company and endusers use of the licensed software product is restricted to specified sites unless the customer obtains a multisite license for its use of the software product software security measures are also employed to prevent unauthorized use of the companys software products and the licensed software is subject to terms and conditions prohibiting unauthorized reproduction customers may purchase a perpetual license of the technology with the right to annually purchase ongoing maintenance technical support and upgrades or may lease the product on a fixedterm basis for a fee that includes the license maintenance technical support and upgrades 

the company licenses its software products utilizing a combination of webbased and hardcopy license terms and forms for certain software products the company primarily relies on clickwrapped licenses the enforceability of these types of agreements under the laws of some jurisdictions is uncertain 

the company also seeks to protect the source code of its software as a trade secret and as unpublished copyrighted work the company has obtained federal trademark registration protection for ansys and other marks in the us and foreign countries additionally the company was awarded numerous patents by the us patent and trademark office and has a number of patent applications pending to the extent the company does not choose to seek patent protection for its intellectual property the company primarily relies on the protection of its source code as a trade secret 

employees of the company have signed agreements under which they have agreed not to disclose trade secrets or confidential information and where legally permitted that restrict engagement in or connection with any business that is competitive with the company anywhere in the world while employed by the company and in some cases for specified periods thereafter and that any products or technology created by them during their term of employment are the property of the company in addition the company requires all channel partners to enter into agreements not to disclose the companys trade secrets and other proprietary information 

despite these precautions there can be no assurance that misappropriation of the companys technology and proprietary information including source code will be prevented further there can be no assurance that copyright trademark patent and trade secret protection will be available for the companys products in certain jurisdictions or that restrictions on the ability of employees and channel partners to engage in activities competitive with the company will be enforceable costly and timeconsuming litigation could be necessary in the future to enforce the companys rights to its trade secrets and proprietary information or to enforce its patent rights and copyrights and it is possible that in the future the companys competitors may be able to obtain the companys trade secrets or to independently develop similar unpatented technology 

the software development industry is characterized by rapid technological change therefore the company believes that factors such as the technological and creative skills of its personnel new product developments frequent product enhancements name recognition and reliable product maintenance are also important to establishing and maintaining technology leadership in addition to the various legal protections of its technology that may be available 

the company does not believe that any of its products infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties there can be no assurance however that third parties will not claim such infringement by the company or its licensors or licensees with respect to current or future products the company expects that software suppliers will increasingly be subject to the risk of such claims as the number of products and suppliers continues to expand and the functionality of products continues to increase any such claims with or without merit could be time consuming result in costly litigation cause product release delays or require the company to enter into royalty or licensing agreements such royalty or licensing agreements if required may not be available on terms acceptable to the company 

seasonal variations 

the companys business has experienced seasonality including quarterly reductions in software sales resulting from slowdowns of customer activities during the summer months particularly in europe as well as from the seasonal purchasing and budgeting patterns of the companys global customers the companys revenue is typically highest in the fourth quarter 

deferred revenue and backlog 

deferred revenue consists of billings made or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from software license and maintenance agreements the deferred revenue on the companys consolidated balance sheets does not represent the total value of annual or multiyear noncancellable software license and maintenance agreements the companys backlog represents installment billings for periods beyond the current quarterly billing cycle and customer orders received but not p rocessed the companys deferred revenue and backlog as of december 31 2014  and 2013  consisted of the following

risk factors 

tableend information provided by the company or its spokespersons including information contained in this annual report on form 10k may from time to time contain forwardlooking statements concerning projected financial performance market and industry sector growth product development and commercialization or other aspects of future operations such statements will be based on the assumptions and expectations of the companys management at the time such statements are made the company cautions investors that its performance and therefore any forwardlooking statement is subject to risks and uncertainties various important factors including but not limited to the following may cause the companys future results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statement 

global economic conditions   the companys operations and performance depend significantly on foreign and domestic economic conditions uncertainty regarding economic conditions may negatively impact the company as customers defer spending in response to tighter credit higher unemployment financial market volatility government austerity programs negative financial news declining valuations of investments and other factors in addition certain of the companys customers budgets may be constrained and they may be unable to purchase the companys products at the same level as prior periods the companys customers ability to pay for the companys products and services may also be impaired which may lead to an increase in the companys allowance for doubtful accounts and writeoffs of accounts receivable since the company is exposed to the majority of major world markets uncertainty in any significant market may negatively impact the companys performance and results particularly with respect to the companys largest geographic customer bases the company is unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the current economic conditions or the likelihood of additional uncertainty arising in any of the companys key markets should these conditions result in the company not meeting its revenue growth objectives the companys operating results cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 

decline in customers businesses   the companys sales are based significantly on enduser demand for products in key industrial sectors many of these sectors periodically experience economic declines which may be exacerbated by other economic factors these factors may also adversely affect the companys business by extending sales cycles and reducing revenue these economic factors may cause the companys customers to reduce the size of their workforce or cut back on operations and may lead to a reduction in renewals of licenses or maintenance contracts with the company the companys customers may request discounts or extended payment terms on new products or seek to extend payment terms on existing contracts all of which may cause fluctuations in the companys future operating results the company may not be able to adjust its operating expenses to offset such fluctuations because a substantial portion of the companys operating expenses is related to personnel facilities and marketing programs the level of personnel and related expenses may not be able to be adjusted quickly and is based in significant part on the companys expectation for future revenue 

risks associated with international activities a majority of the companys business comes from outside the united states and the company has customers that supply a wide spectrum of goods and services in virtually all of the worlds major economic regions as the company continues to expand its sales presence in international regions the portion of its revenue expenses cash accounts receivable and payment obligations denominated in foreign currencies continues to increase if any of the foreign economies in which the company does business deteriorate or suffer periods of uncertainty the companys business and performance may be negatively impacted through reduced customer spending changes in purchasing cycles or timing reduced access to credit for its customers or other factors impacting the companys international sales and collections 

as a result of its increasing international activities the company has revenue expenses cash accounts receivable and payment obligations denominated in foreign currencies as a result the company is subject to currency exchange risk the companys revenues and operating results are adversely affected when the us dollar strengthens relative to other currencies and are positively affected when the us dollar weakens as a result changes in currency exchange rates will affect the companys financial position results of operations and cash flows in the event that there are economic declines in countries in which the company conducts transactions the resulting changes in currency exchange rates may affect the companys financial position results of operations and cash flows the company is most impacted by movements in and among the japanese yen euro british pound korean won indian rupee russian rouble and us dollar the company seeks to reduce these risks primarily through its normal operating and treasury activities but there can be no assurance that it will be successful in reducing these risks 

additional risks inherent in the companys international business activities include imposition of government controls export license requirements restrictions on the export of critical technology products and services the violation of anticorruption laws and regulations which are applicable to the company by third parties in countries where such conduct may be permissible or commonplace political and economic instability trade restrictions changes in tariffs and taxes difficulties in staffing and managing international operations longer accounts receivable payment cycles and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations effective patent copyright trademark and trade secret protection may not be available in every foreign country in which the company sells its products and services the companys business financial position results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks 

stock market and stock price volatility  market prices for securities of software companies have generally been volatile in particular the market price of the companys common stock has been and may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations as a result of factors affecting the company the software industry or the securities markets in general such factors include but are not limited to declines in trading price that may be triggered by the companys failure to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors moreover the trading price could be subject to additional fluctuations in response to quartertoquarter variations in the companys operating results material announcements made by the company or its competitors conditions in the financial markets or the software industry generally or other events and factors many of which are beyond the companys control 

rapidly changing technology new products risk of product errors the company operates in an industry generally characterized by rapidly changing technology and frequent new product introductions which can render existing products obsolete or unmarketable a major factor in the companys future success will be its ability to anticipate technological changes and to develop and introduce in a timely manner enhancements to its existing products products acquired in acquisitions and new products to meet those changes if the company is unable to introduce new products and to respond quickly to industry changes its business financial position results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

the introduction and marketing of new or enhanced products require the company to manage the transition from existing products in order to minimize disruption in customer purchasing patterns there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing and marketing on a timely basis new products or product enhancements that its new products will adequately address the changing needs of the marketplace or that it will successfully manage the transition from existing products software products as complex as those offered by the company may contain undetected errors when first introduced or as new versions are released and the likelihood of errors is increased as a result of the companys commitment to the frequency of its product releases there can be no assurance that errors will not be found in any new or enhanced products after commencement of commercial shipments certain products require a higher level of sales and support expertise the ability of the companys sales channel particularly the indirect channel to obtain this expertise and to sell the new product offerings effectively could have an adverse impact on the companys sales in future periods any of these problems may result in the loss of or delay in customer acceptance diversion of development resources damage to the companys reputation or increased service and warranty costs any of which could have a material adverse effect on the companys business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

product quality the company has separate quality systems and registrations under the iso 90012008 standard in addition to other governmental and industrial regulations the company’s continued compliance with quality standards and favorable outcomes in periodic examinations is important to retain current customers and vital to procure new sales if the company was determined not to be compliant with various regulatory or iso 90019000 standards its certificates of registration could be suspended requiring remedial action and a timeconsuming reregistration process product quality issues or failures could result in the company’s reputation becoming diminished resulting in a material adverse impact on revenue operating margins net income financial position and cash flows 

competition  the company continues to experience competition across all markets for its products and services some of the companys current and possible future competitors have greater financial technical marketing and other resources than the company and some have wellestablished relationships with current and potential customers of the company the companys current and possible future competitors also include firms that have or may in the future elect to compete by means of open source licensing parties among the companys current or future strategic alliances may diminish or sever technical software development and marketing relationships with the company for competitive purposes these competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes price reductions andor increased operating costs and could result in lower revenues margins and net income 

changes in the companys pricing models the intense competition the company faces in the sales of its products and services and general economic and business conditions can put pressure on the company to adjust its prices if the companys competitors offer deep discounts on certain products or services or develop products that the marketplace considers more valuable the company may need to lower prices or offer discounts or other favorable terms in order to compete successfully any such changes may reduce operating margins and could adversely affect operating results the companys software license updates and product support fees are generally priced as a percentage of its new software license fees the companys competitors may offer lower percentage pricing on product updates and support that could put pressure on the company to further discount its new license or product support prices 

any broadbased change to the companys prices and pricing policies could cause new software license and service revenues to decline or be delayed as its sales force implements and its customers adjust to the new pricing policies some of the companys competitors may bundle software products for promotional purposes or as a longterm pricing strategy or provide guarantees of prices product implementations or wider geographical license usage provisions these practices could over time significantly constrain the prices that the company can charge for certain of its products if the company does not adapt its pricing models to reflect changes in customer use of its products or changes in customer demand the companys new software license revenues could decrease additionally increased distribution of applications through application service providers including softwareasaservice providers may reduce the average price for the companys products or adversely affect other sales of the companys products reducing new software license revenues unless the company can offset price reductions with volume increases the increase in open source software distribution may also cause the company to adjust its pricing models 

dependence on senior management and key technical personnel  the companys success depends upon the continued services of the companys senior executives key technical employees and other employees each of the companys executive 

officers key technical personnel and other employees could terminate his or her relationship with the company at any time the loss of any of the companys senior executives might significantly delay or prevent the achievement of the companys business objectives and could materially harm the companys business and customer relationships 

in addition because of the highly technical nature of the companys products the company must attract and retain highly skilled engineering and development personnel many of whom are recruited from outside of the united states the market for this talent is highly competitive the company is limited in its ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws if the company has less success in recruiting and retaining key personnel the companys business reputation and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 

dependence on proprietary technology  the companys success is highly dependent upon its proprietary technology the company generally relies on contracts and the laws of copyrights patents trademarks and trade secrets to protect its technology the company maintains a trade secrets program enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees and channel partners and limits access to and distribution of its software documentation and other proprietary information there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company to protect its proprietary technology will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of its technology by third parties or that third parties will not be able to develop similar technology independently costly and timeconsuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of trade secret rights and related confidentiality and nondisclosure provisions although the company is not aware that any of its technology infringes upon the rights of third parties there can be no assurance that other parties will not assert technology infringement claims against the company or that if asserted such claims will not prevail 

risks associated with security of the companys products source code and it systems the company makes significant efforts to maintain and improve the security and integrity of its products source code computer systems and data despite significant efforts to create security barriers to such programs it is virtually impossible for the company to entirely mitigate this risk there appears to be an increasing number of computer “hackers” developing and deploying a variety of destructive software programs such as viruses worms and the like that could attack the companys products and computer systems because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to networks or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target the company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures like all software products the companys software is vulnerable to such attacks the impact of such an attack could disrupt the proper functioning of the companys software products cause errors in the output of its customers work allow unauthorized access to sensitive proprietary or confidential information of the company or its customers and other destructive outcomes if this were to occur the companys reputation may suffer customers may stop buying its products it could face lawsuits and potential liability and its financial performance could be negatively impacted 

there is also a danger of industrial espionage cyberattacks misuse theft of information or assets including source code or damage to assets by people who have gained unauthorized access to the companys facilities systems or information such cybersecurity breaches misuse or other disruptions could lead to the disclosure of portions of the companys product source code or other confidential information improper usage and distribution of its products without compensation illegal usage of its products which could jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through its computer systems and theft manipulation and destruction of private and proprietary data resulting in defective products and production downtimes although the company actively employs measures to combat unlicensed copying access and use of software and intellectual property through a variety of techniques preventing unauthorized use or infringement of the companys rights is inherently difficult these events could adversely affect the companys financial results or could result in significant claims for damages against it participating in lawsuits to protect against any such unauthorized access to usage of or disclosure of any of the companys products or any portion of the companys product source code or in prosecutions in connection with any such cybersecurity breach could be costly and timeconsuming and may divert managements attention adversely affecting the markets perception of the company and its products 

policing the unauthorized distribution and use of the companys products is difficult and software piracy including online piracy is a persistent problem the proliferation of technology designed to circumvent typical software protection measures used in the companys products and the possibility that methods of circumventing the techniques it employs in its products may lead to an expansion in piracy or misuse of its products and intellectual property as a result and despite the companys efforts to prevent such activities and to prosecute instances of such activities the company may nonetheless lose significant revenue due to illegal use of its software and managements attention may be diverted to address specific instances of piracy or misuse or address piracy and misuse in general 

a number of the companys core processes such as software development sales and marketing customer service and financial transactions rely on its it infrastructure and applications the company also relies upon thirdparty products which are exposed to various security vulnerabilities malicious software sabotage and other cybersecurity breaches of the types discussed above could cause an outage of the companys infrastructure which could lead to a substantial denial of service and 

ultimately to production downtime recovery costs and customer claims this could have a significant negative impact on the companys business financial position profit or cash flows 

the company has implemented a number of measures designed to ensure the security of its information it resources and other assets nonetheless unauthorized users could gain access to its systems through cyberattacks and steal use without authorization and sabotage the companys intellectual property and confidential data any breach of its it security misuse or theft could lead to loss of production recovery costs or litigation brought by employees customers or business partners which could have a significant negative impact on the companys business financial position profit cash flows and reputation 

dependence on channel partners  the company continues to distribute a meaningful portion of its products through its global network of independent regional channel partners the channel partners sell the companys software products to new and existing customers expand installations within the existing customer base offer consulting services and provide the first line of technical support consequently in certain geographies the company is highly dependent upon the efforts of the channel partners difficulties in ongoing relationships with channel partners such as failure to meet performance criteria or to promote the companys products as aggressively as the company expects and differences in the handling of customer relationships could adversely affect the companys performance additionally the loss of any major channel partner for any reason including a channel partners decision to sell competing products rather than the companys products could have a material adverse effect on the company moreover the companys future success will depend substantially on the ability and willingness of its channel partners to continue to dedicate the resources necessary to promote the companys portfolio of products and to support a larger installed base of the companys products if the channel partners are unable or unwilling to do so the company may be unable to sustain revenue growth 

during times of significant fluctuations in world currencies certain channel partners may have solvency issues to the extent that effective hedge transactions are not employed or there is not sufficient working capital in particular if the us dollar strengthens relative to other currencies certain channel partners who pay the company in us dollars may have trouble paying the company on time or may have trouble distributing the companys products due to the impact of the currency exchange fluctuation on such channel partners cash flows this may impact the companys ability to distribute its products into certain regions and markets and may have an adverse effect on the companys results of operations and cash flows 

reliance on perpetual licenses  although the company has historically maintained stable recurring revenue from the sale of software lease licenses and software maintenance subscriptions it also has relied on sales of perpetual licenses that involve payment of a single upfront fee and that are more typical in the computer software industry while revenue generated from software lease licenses and software maintenance subscriptions currently represents a portion of the companys revenue to the extent that perpetual license revenue continues to represent a significant percentage of total revenue the companys revenue in any period will depend significantly on sales completed during that period if customer purchasing patterns shift toward a stronger preference for lease licenses and fewer perpetual licenses there could be a shortterm adverse impact on the companys revenue and profitability 

in addition the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 which   supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance including industryspecific guidance this update which is effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15 2016 could affect the timing and amounts of revenue recognized for perpetual licenses which could have an adverse impact on the companys revenue and results of operations 

renewal rates for annual lease and maintenance contracts a substantial portion of the companys license and maintenance revenue is derived from annual lease and maintenance contracts these contracts are generally renewed on an annual basis and typically have a high rate of customer renewal in addition to the recurring revenue base associated with these contracts a majority of customers purchasing new perpetual licenses also purchase related annual maintenance contracts if the rate of renewal for these contracts is adversely affected by economic or other factors the companys license and maintenance growth will be adversely affected over the term that the revenue for those contracts would have otherwise been recognized as a result the companys business financial position results of operations and cash flows may also be adversely impacted during those periods 

risks associated with acquisitions historically the company has consummated acquisitions in order to support the companys longterm strategic direction accelerate innovation provide increased capabilities to existing products supply new products and services expand its customer base and enhance its distribution channels the company has completed a number of acquisitions in recent years and expects to make additional acquisitions in the future but may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or if suitable candidates are identified the company may not be able to complete the business combination on commercially acceptable terms the process of exploring and pursuing acquisition opportunities may result in devotion of significant management and financial resources 

even if the company is able to consummate acquisitions that it believes will be successful such transactions present many risks including among others failing to achieve anticipated synergies and revenue increases difficulty incorporating and integrating the acquired technologies or products with the companys existing product lines difficulty in coordinating establishing or expanding sales distribution and marketing functions as necessary disruption of the companys ongoing business and diversion of managements attention to transition or integration issues unanticipated and unknown liabilities the loss of key employees customers partners and channel partners of the company or of the acquired company and difficulties implementing and maintaining sufficient controls policies and procedures over the systems products and processes of the acquired company if the company does not achieve the anticipated benefits of its acquisitions as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by the companys management and financial or industry analysts there could be a material adverse effect on the companys stock price business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in addition for companies acquired limited experience will exist for several quarters following the acquisition relating to how the acquired companys sales pipelines will convert into sales or revenues and the conversion rate postacquisition may be quite different than the historical conversion rate because a substantial portion of the companys sales are completed in the latter part of a quarter and its cost structure is largely fixed in the shortterm revenue shortfalls may have a negative impact on the companys profitability a delay in a small number of large new software license transactions could cause the companys quarterly software license revenues to fall significantly short of its predictions 

risks associated with the spaceclaim and reaction design acquisitions on april 30 2014 the company completed the acquisition of spaceclaim under the terms of the agreement ansys acquired spaceclaim for a purchase price of 850 million  which was paid almost entirely in cash on january 3 2014 the company completed the acquisition of reaction design under the terms of the agreement ansys acquired reaction design for a purchase price of 191 million  in cash the acquisitions are expected to accelerate development of new and innovative products to the marketplace while lowering design and engineering costs for customers the company will need to meet significant challenges to realize the expected benefits and synergies of the acquisitions these challenges include 

 the accomplishment of these postacquisition objectives will involve considerable risks including 

 the market price of the company’s common stock may decline as a result of the acquisitions for a number of reasons including 

 15 

if the company does not succeed in addressing these challenges or any other problems encountered in connection with the acquisitions its operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

disruption of operations or infrastructure failures  a significant portion of the companys software development personnel source code and computer equipment is located at operating facilities in the united states canada india japan and throughout europe the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unforeseen catastrophe at any of these facilities could cause interruptions in the companys operations services and product development activities additionally if the company experiences problems that impair its business infrastructure such as a computer virus telephone system failure or an intentional disruption of its information technology systems by a third party these interruptions could have a material adverse effect on the companys business financial position results of operations cash flows and the ability to meet financial reporting deadlines further because the companys sales are not generally linear during any quarterly period the potential adverse effects resulting from any of the events described above or any other disruption of the companys business could be accentuated if it occurs close to the end of a fiscal quarter 

sales forecasts  the company makes many operational and strategic decisions based upon short and longterm sales forecasts the companys sales personnel continually monitor the status of all proposals including the estimated closing date and the value of the sale in order to forecast quarterly sales these forecasts are subject to significant estimation and are impacted by many external factors including global economic conditions and the performance of the companys customers a variation in actual sales activity from that forecasted could cause the company to plan or budget incorrectly and therefore could adversely affect the companys business financial position results of operations and cash flows the companys management team forecasts macroeconomic trends and developments and integrates them through longrange planning into budgets research and development strategies and a wide variety of general management duties global economic conditions and the effect those conditions and other disruptions in global markets have on the companys customers may have a significant impact on the accuracy of the companys sales forecasts these conditions may increase the likelihood or the magnitude of variations between actual sales activity and the companys sales forecasts and as a result the companys performance may be hindered because of a failure to properly match corporate strategy with economic conditions this in turn may adversely affect the companys business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

risks associated with significant sales to existing customers  a significant portion of the companys sales includes followon sales to existing customers that invest in the companys broad suite of engineering simulation software and services if a significant number of current customers were to become dissatisfied with the companys products and services or choose to license or utilize competitive offerings the companys followon sales and recurring lease and maintenance revenues could be materially adversely impacted resulting in reduced revenue operating margins net income and cash flows 

periodic reorganization of sales force  the company relies heavily on its direct sales force from time to time the company reorganizes and makes adjustments to its sales leadership andor its sales force in response to such factors as management changes performance issues market opportunities and other considerations these changes may result in a temporary lack of sales production and may adversely impact revenue in future quarters there can be no assurance that the company will not restructure its sales force in future periods or that the transition issues associated with such a restructuring will not occur 

income tax estimates  the company makes significant estimates in determining its worldwide income tax provision these estimates involve complex tax regulations in a number of jurisdictions across the companys global operations and are subject to many transactions and calculations in which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain the final outcome of tax matters could be different than the estimates reflected in the historical income tax provision and related accruals such differences could have a material impact on income tax expense and net income in the periods in which such determinations are made 

the amount of income tax paid by the company is subject to ongoing audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities these audits can often result in additional assessments including interest and penalties the companys estimate for liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions is highly judgmental and actual future outcomes may result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to the companys estimated tax liabilities including estimates for uncertain tax positions in the period the assessments are made or resolved audits are closed or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire as a result the companys effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly or annual basis 

the company allocates a portion of its purchase price to goodwill and intangible assets impairment charges associated with goodwill are generally not taxdeductible and will result in an increased effective income tax rate in the period the impairment is recorded the company has recorded significant deferred tax liabilities related to acquired intangible assets that are not deductible for tax purposes these deferred tax liabilities are based on future statutory tax rates in the locations in which the intangible assets are recorded any future changes in statutory tax rates would be recorded as an adjustment to the deferred tax liabilities in the period the change is announced and could have a material impact on the companys effective tax rate during that period 

regulatory compliance  like all other public companies the company is subject to the rules and regulations of the sec including those that require the company to report on and receive an attestation from its independent registered public accounting firm regarding the companys internal control over financial reporting compliance with these requirements causes the company to incur additional expenses and causes management to divert time from the daytoday operations of the company while the company anticipates being able to fully comply with these requirements if it is not able to comply with the sarbanesoxley reporting or attestation requirements relating to internal control over financial reporting the company may be subject to sanctions by the sec or nasdaq such sanctions could divert the attention of the companys management from implementing its business plan and could have an adverse effect on the companys business and results of operations 

as the companys stock is listed on the nasdaq global select market the company is subject to the ongoing financial and corporate governance requirements of nasdaq while the company anticipates being able to fully comply with these requirements if it is not able to comply the companys name may be published on nasdaqs daily noncompliant companies list until nasdaq determines that it has regained compliance or the company no longer trades on nasdaq if the company were unable to return to compliance with the governance requirements of nasdaq the company may be delisted from the nasdaq global select market which could have an adverse effect on the market value of the companys equity securities and the ability to raise additional capital 

governmental revenue sources the companys sales to the united states government must comply with federal acquisition regulations failure to comply with these regulations could result in penalties being assessed against the company or an order preventing the company from making future sales to the united states government further the companys international activities must comply with the export control laws of the united states and other countries the foreign corrupt practices act the united kingdom bribery act of 2010 and a variety of other laws and regulations of the united states and other countries in which the company operates failure to comply with any of these laws and regulations could adversely affect the companys business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

in certain circumstances the united states government state and local governments and their respective agencies and certain foreign governments may have the right to terminate contractual arrangements at any time without cause the united states european union and certain other government contracts as well as the companys state and local level contracts are subject to the approval of appropriations or funding authorizations certain of these contracts permit the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions including but not limited to termination of contracts refund of a portion of fees received forfeiture of profits suspension of payments fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business any of which could have an adverse effect on the companys results of operations and cash flows 

contingencies  the company is subject to various investigations claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business including commercial disputes labor and employment matters tax audits alleged infringement of intellectual property rights and other matters each of these matters is subject to various uncertainties and it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could materially affect the companys results of operations cash flows or financial position 

changes in existing financial accounting standards changes in existing accounting rules or practices new accounting pronouncements or varying interpretations of current accounting pronouncements could have a significant adverse effect on the companys results of operations or the manner in which the company conducts its business 

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606  asu 201409 asu 201409 supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance including industryspecific guidance the company is currently evaluating the effect that implementation of this update will have on its financial results upon adoption this update will impact the timing and amounts of revenue recognized including a potential impact on transactions completed prior to adoption which could have a significant adverse impact on the companys results of operations 

in addition the company could incur significant costs for changes to its business systems processes and internal controls as a result of the transition these costs could have a significant adverse impact on the companys results of operations and cash flows the transition could also cause management to divert time from the daytoday operations of the company which could impact the companys business if the company is unable to successfully transition its business systems processes and internal controls before the guidance effective date it could impact the ability to meet financial reporting deadlines 

changes in tax law the companys operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions a change in the tax law in the jurisdictions in which the company does business including an increase in tax rates an adverse change in the treatment of an item of income or expense or a decrease in tax rates in a jurisdiction in which the company has significant deferred tax assets could result in a material increase in tax expense currently a substantial portion of the companys revenue is generated from customers located outside the united states and a 

substantial portion of assets are located outside the united states united states income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings for nonunited states subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries changes in existing taxation rules or practices new taxation rules or varying interpretations of current taxation practices could have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations or the manner in which the company conducts its business 

the company has significant operations in india there have been court rulings concerning certain indian tax laws that have been inconsistent with tax positions taken by the company and inconsistent with the advice provided to the company by its tax advisors 

an indian subsidiary of the company received a formal inquiry after a service tax audit was held in 2011 the company could incur tax charges and related liabilities including those related to the service tax audit case of approximately 6 million  the service tax issues raised in the company’s notice are very similar to the case ms microsoft corporation i p ltd vs commissioner of service tax  new delhi  wherein the delhi customs excise and service tax appellate tribunal cestat has passed a ruling favorable to microsoft the company can provide no assurances on whether the microsoft case’s favorable ruling will be challenged in higher courts or on the impact that the microsoft case’s decision will have on the company’s audit case the company is uncertain as to when the service tax audit will be completed 

other court cases are pending in india that could have a material impact on the companys financial position results of operations or cash flows if the ultimate outcome of those cases is similarly inconsistent with tax positions taken by the company

revenue 



the company’s revenue increased 87  during the year ended december 31 2014  as compared to the year ended december 31 2013  including increases in all major revenue categories the growth was partially influenced by benefits from the company’s continued investment in its global sales and marketing organization revenue from lease licenses increased 68  as compared to the prior year due primarily to growth in lease license revenue of power analysis and electronics products perpetual license revenue which is derived primarily from new sales increased 66  as compared to the prior year annual maintenance contracts that were sold with new perpetual licenses along with maintenance contracts sold with new perpetual licenses in previous years contributed to maintenance revenue growth of 122  

with respect to revenue on average for the year ended december 31 2014  the us dollar was 16  stronger when measured against the company’s primary foreign currencies than for the year ended december 31 2013  the net overall strengthening resulted in decreased revenue of 76 million  during the year ended december 31 2014  as compared to the year ended december 31 2013  the impact on revenue was primarily driven by 98 million  of adverse impact due to a weakening japanese yen partially offset by 19 million  of favorable impact due to a strengthening british pound the net overall strengthening of the us dollar also resulted in decreased operating income of 51 million  during the year ended december 31 2014  as compared to the year ended december 31 2013  

a substantial portion of the company’s license and maintenance revenue is derived from annual lease and maintenance contracts these contracts are generally renewed on an annual basis and typically have a high rate of customer renewal in addition to the recurring revenue base associated with these contracts a majority of customers purchasing new perpetual licenses also purchase related annual maintenance contracts as a result of the significant recurring revenue base the company’s license and maintenance revenue growth rate in any period does not necessarily correlate to the growth rate of new license and maintenance contracts sold during that period to the extent the rate of customer renewal for lease and maintenance contracts is high incremental lease contracts and maintenance contracts sold with new perpetual licenses will result in license and maintenance revenue growth conversely if the rate of renewal for these contracts is adversely affected by economic or other factors the company’s license and maintenance growth will be adversely affected over the term that the revenue for those contracts would have otherwise been recognized 

international and domestic revenues as a percentage of total revenue were 658  and 342  respectively during the year ended december 31 2014  and 661  and 339  respectively during the year ended december 31 2013  the company derived 249  and 253  of its total revenue through the indirect sales channel for the years ended december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively 

in valuing deferred revenue on the balance sheets of the companys recent acquisitions as of their respective acquisition dates the company applied the fair value provisions applicable to the accounting for business combinations resulting in a reduction of deferred revenue as compared to its historical carrying amount as a result the companys postacquisition revenue will be less than the sum of what would have otherwise been reported by ansys and its subsidiaries absent the acquisitions the impact on reported revenue for the year ended december 31 2014  was 54 million  the expected impact on reported revenue is 12 million  for the year ending december 31 2015

 note the 2013 gaap and nongaap net income and earnings per share data reflected above include 110 million of incremental tax benefits or 012 per diluted share related to the notification received from the irs that the joint committee on taxation took no exception to the companys tax returns that were filed for 2009 and 2010 thus effectively settling the uncertainty regarding refund claims filed in connection with those returns 

nongaap measures 

management uses nongaap financial measures a to evaluate the companys historical and prospective financial performance as well as its performance relative to its competitors b to set internal sales targets and spending budgets c to allocate resources d to measure operational profitability and the accuracy of forecasting e to assess financial discipline over operational expenditures and f as an important factor in determining variable compensation for management and its employees in addition many financial analysts that follow the company focus on and publish both historical results and future projections based on nongaap financial measures the company believes that it is in the best interest of its investors to provide this information to analysts so that they accurately report the nongaap financial information moreover investors have historically requested and the company has historically reported these nongaap financial measures as a means of providing consistent and comparable information with past reports of financial results 

while management believes that these nongaap financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors there are limitations associated with the use of these nongaap financial measures these nongaap financial measures are not prepared in accordance with gaap are not reported by all of the company’s competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of the company’s competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation the company compensates for these limitations by using these nongaap financial measures as supplements to gaap financial measures and by reviewing the reconciliations of the nongaap financial measures to their most comparable gaap financial measures 

the adjustments to these nongaap financial measures and the basis for such adjustments are outlined below 

acquisition accounting for deferred revenue and its related tax impact historically the company has consummated acquisitions in order to support its strategic and other business objectives in accordance with the fair value provisions applicable to the accounting for business combinations acquired deferred revenue is often recorded on the opening balance sheet at an amount that is lower than the historical carrying value although this purchase accounting requirement has no impact on the company’s business or cash flow it adversely impacts the company’s reported gaap revenue in the reporting periods following an acquisition in order to provide investors with financial information that facilitates comparison of both historical and future results the company provides nongaap financial measures which exclude the impact of the acquisition accounting adjustment the company believes that this nongaap financial adjustment is useful to investors because it allows investors to a evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in its financial and operational decisionmaking and b compare past and future reports of financial results of the company as the revenue reduction related to acquired deferred revenue will not recur when related annual lease licenses and software maintenance contracts are renewed in future periods 

amortization of intangibles from acquisitions and its related tax impact the company incurs amortization of intangibles included in its gaap presentation of amortization expense related to various acquisitions it has made in recent years management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating nongaap operating income nongaap operating profit margin nongaap net income and nongaap diluted earnings per share when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the company because these costs are fixed at the time of an acquisition are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition accordingly management does not consider these expenses for purposes of evaluating the performance of the company during the applicable time period after the acquisition and it excludes such expenses when making decisions to allocate resources the company believes that these nongaap financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to a evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in its financial and operational decisionmaking and b compare past reports of financial results of the company as the company has historically reported these nongaap financial measures 

stockbased compensation expense and its related tax impact  the company incurs expense related to stockbased compensation included in its gaap presentation of cost of software licenses cost of maintenance and service research and development expense and selling general and administrative expense although stockbased compensation is an expense of the company and viewed as a form of compensation management excludes these expenses for the purpose of calculating nongaap operating income nongaap operating profit margin nongaap net income and nongaap diluted earnings per share when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the company specifically the company excludes stockbased compensation during its annual budgeting process and its quarterly and annual assessments of the company’s and management’s performance the annual budgeting process is the primary mechanism whereby the company allocates resources to various initiatives and operational requirements additionally the annual review by the board of directors during which it compares the companys historical business model and profitability to the planned business model and profitability for the forthcoming year excludes the impact of stockbased compensation in evaluating the performance of senior management and department managers charges related to stockbased compensation are excluded from expenditure and profitability results in fact the company records stockbased compensation expense into a standalone cost center for which no single operational manager is responsible or accountable in this way management is able to review on a periodtoperiod basis each manager’s performance and assess financial discipline over operational expenditures without the effect of stockbased compensation the company believes that these nongaap financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to a evaluate the companys operating results and the effectiveness of the methodology used by management to review the companys operating results and b review historical comparability in the companys financial reporting as well as comparability with competitors operating results 

transaction costs related to business combinations the company incurs expenses for professional services rendered in connection with business combinations which are included in its gaap presentation of selling general and administrative expense these expenses are generally not taxdeductible management excludes these acquisitionrelated transaction expenses for the purpose of calculating nongaap operating income nongaap operating profit margin nongaap net income and nongaap diluted earnings per share when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the company as it generally would not have otherwise incurred these expenses in the periods presented as a part of its continuing operations the company believes that these nongaap financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to a evaluate the companys operating results and the effectiveness of the methodology used by management to review the companys operating results and b review historical comparability in the companys financial reporting as well as comparability with competitors operating results 

nongaap financial measures are not in accordance with or an alternative for gaap the companys nongaap financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable gaap financial measures and should be read only in conjunction with the companys consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the company believes that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition  revenue is derived principally from the licensing of computer software products and from related maintenance contracts revenue from perpetual licenses is classified as license revenue and is recognized upon delivery of the licensed product and the utility that enables the customer to access authorization keys provided that acceptance has occurred and a signed contractual obligation has been received the price is fixed and determinable and collectibility of the receivable is probable the company determines the fair value of postcontract customer support pcs sold together with perpetual licenses based on the rate charged for pcs when sold separately revenue from pcs contracts is classified as maintenance and service revenue and is recognized ratably over the term of the contract 

revenue for software lease licenses is classified as license revenue and is recognized over the period of the lease contract typically the company’s software leases include pcs which due to the short term principally one year or less of the company’s software lease licenses cannot be separated from lease revenue for accounting purposes as a result both the lease license and pcs are recognized ratably over the lease period due to the shortterm nature of the software lease licenses and the frequency with which the company provides major product upgrades typically every 12–18 months the company does not believe that a significant portion of the fee paid under the arrangement is attributable to the pcs component of the arrangement and as a result includes the revenue for the entire arrangement within software license revenue in the consolidated statements of income 

the companys apache products are typically licensed via longer term leases of 24–36 months the company recognizes revenue for these licenses over the term of the lease contract because the company does not have vendorspecific objective evidence of the fair value of these leases the company also recognizes revenue from perpetual licenses over the term of the lease contract during the infrequent occurrence of these licenses being sold with apache leases in multipleelement arrangements 

revenue from training support and other services is recognized as the services are performed the company applies the specific performance method to contracts in which the service consists of a single act such as providing a training class to a customer and the proportional performance method to other service contracts that are longer in duration and often include multiple acts for example both training and consulting in applying the proportional performance method the company typically utilizes outputbased estimates for services with contractual billing arrangements that are not based on time and materials and estimates output based on the total tasks completed as compared to the total tasks required for each work contract inputbased estimates are utilized for services that involve general consultations with contractual billing arrangements based on time and materials utilizing direct labor as the input measure 

the company also executes arrangements through independent channel partners in which the channel partners are authorized to market and distribute the company’s software products to endusers of the company’s products and services in specified territories in sales facilitated by channel partners the channel partner bears the risk of collection from the enduser customer the company recognizes revenue from transactions with channel partners when the channel partner submits a written purchase commitment collectibility from the channel partner is probable a signed license agreement is received from the enduser customer and delivery has occurred provided that all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied revenue from channel partner transactions is the amount remitted to the company by the channel partners this amount includes a fee for pcs that is compensation for providing technical enhancements and the second level of technical support to the enduser which is based on the rate charged for pcs when sold separately and is recognized over the period that pcs is to be provided the company does not offer right of return product rotation or price protection to any of its channel partners 

nonincome related taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as accounts receivable and accrued expenses the collection and payment of these amounts are reported on a net basis in the consolidated statements of income and do not impact reported revenues or expenses 

the company warrants to its customers that its software will substantially perform as specified in the company’s most current user manuals the company has not experienced significant claims related to software warranties beyond the scope of maintenance support which the company is already obligated to provide and consequently the company has not established reserves for warranty obligations 

the company’s agreements with its customers generally require it to indemnify the customer against claims that the company’s software infringes thirdparty patent copyright trademark or other proprietary rights such indemnification obligations are generally limited in a variety of industrystandard respects including the company’s right to replace an infringing product as of december 31 2014  the company had not experienced any losses related to these indemnification obligations and no claims with respect thereto were outstanding the company does not expect significant claims related to these indemnification obligations and consequently the company has not established any related reserves 

allowance for doubtful accounts  the company makes judgments as to its ability to collect outstanding receivables and provides allowances for a portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices from both value and delinquency perspectives for those invoices not specifically reviewed provisions are provided at differing rates based upon the age of the receivable and the geographic area of origin in determining these percentages the company considers its historical collection experience and current economic trends in the customer’s industry and geographic region if the historical data used to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and future results of operations could be materially affected 

income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period of the enactment date 

the company records net deferred tax assets to the extent it believes these assets will more likely than not be realized in making such determination the company considers all available positive and negative evidence including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and recent financial operations in the event the company determines that it will be able to realize deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be recorded that would reduce the provision for income taxes 

tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a more likely than not threshold otherwise these tax benefits are recorded when a tax position has been effectively settled which means that the statute of limitations has expired or the appropriate taxing authority has completed their examination even though the statute of limitations remains open the company recognizes interest and penalties related to income taxes within the income tax expense line in the consolidated statements of income accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheets 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets the company tests goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment at least annually by performing a quantitative assessment of whether the fair value of each reporting unit or asset exceeds its carrying amount goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level and indefinitelived intangible assets are tested at the individual asset level this requires the company to assess and make judgments regarding a variety of factors which impact the fair value of the reporting unit or asset being tested including business plans anticipated future cash flows economic projections and other market data because there are inherent uncertainties involved in these factors significant differences between these estimates and actual results could result in future impairment charges and could materially impact the companys future financial results during the first quarter of 2014  the company completed the annual impairment test for goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets and determined that these assets had not been impaired as of the test date january 1 2014  

contingencies   the company is involved in various investigations claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business including commercial disputes labor and employment matters tax audits alleged infringement of intellectual property rights and other matters the company reviews the status of these matters assesses its financial exposure and records a related accrual if the potential loss from an investigation claim or legal proceeding is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable significant judgment is involved in the determination of probability and in the determination of whether an exposure is reasonably estimable as a result of the uncertainties involved in making these estimates the company may have to revise its estimates as facts and circumstances change the revision of these estimates could have a material impact on the company’s financial position and results of operations 

stockbased compensation the company grants options and other stock awards to employees and directors under the company’s stock option and grant plan eligible employees can also purchase shares of the company’s common stock at a discount under the company’s employee stock purchase plan the benefits provided under these plans are sharebased payments subject to the provisions of sharebased payment accounting guidance the company uses the fair value method to apply the provisions of sharebased payment accounting guidance stockbased compensation expense for 2014  2013  and 2012   

was 369 million  353 million  and 324 million  respectively as of december 31 2014  total unrecognized estimated compensation expense related to unvested stock options granted prior to that date was 213 million  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 15 years  

the value of each stock option award was estimated on the date of grant or date of acquisition for options issued in a business combination using the blackscholes option pricing model “blackscholes model” the determination of the fair value of sharebased payment awards using an option pricing model is affected by the company’s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables these variables include the company’s expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors riskfree interest rates and expected dividends the table below presents the weighted average input assumptions used and resulting fair values for options granted or issued in business combinations during each respective year the stockbased compensation expense for options is recorded ratably over their requisite service period the interest rate assumptions were determined by using the fiveyear us treasury note yield on the date of grant or date of acquisition   



prior to 2012 the company issued both nonqualified and incentive stock options however the company no longer issues incentive stock options the tax benefits associated with the outstanding incentive stock options are unpredictable as they are predicated upon an award recipient triggering an event that disqualifies the award and that then results in a tax deduction to the company 

under the terms of the ansys inc longterm incentive plan or in conjunction with an acquisition agreement the company issues various restricted stock awards which may have a single or combination of a market condition an operating performance condition or a service condition restricted stock awards with a service condition or an operating performance condition are valued based on the grant date fair value of the award stock compensation expense is recognized over the employees requisite service period for awards with only a service condition for awards with an operating performance condition stockbased compensation expense is recorded from the service inception date through the conclusion of the measurement period based on management’s estimates concerning the probability of vesting vesting of restricted stock awards with a market condition or a portion thereof is based on the company’s performance as measured by total shareholder return relative to the median percentage appreciation of the nasdaq composite index over a specified measurement period subject to each participant’s continued employment with the company through the conclusion of the measurement period the fair value of the restricted stock units is estimated using a monte carlo simulation model the determination of the fair value of the awards is affected by the grant date and a number of variables each of which has been identified in the chart below for awards granted during each respective period sharebased compensation expense based on the fair value of the award is being recorded from the grant date through the conclusion of the measurement period 



the company also grants deferred stock units to nonaffiliate independent directors which are rights to receive shares of common stock upon termination of service as a director the deferred stock units are issued in arrears and vest immediately 

to the extent the company changes the terms of its stockbased compensation programs experiences market volatility in the pricing of its common stock that increases the implied volatility assumption used in the blackscholes model refines different assumptions in future periods such as forfeiture rates that differ from current estimates or assumes stock awards from acquired companies that are different in nature than the companys stock award arrangements among other potential impacts the stockbased compensation expense recorded in future periods and the related tax benefits may differ significantly from what was recorded in previous reporting periods 

estimates of stockbased compensation expense are significant to the company’s financial statements but this expense is based on the aforementioned option valuation models and will never result in the payment of cash by the company for this reason and because the company does not view stockbased compensation as related to its operational performance the board of directors and management exclude stockbased compensation expense when evaluating the company’s underlying business performance

the company continues to experience competition across all markets for its products and services some of the companys current and possible future competitors have greater financial technical marketing and other resources than the company and some have well established relationships with current and potential customers of the company the companys current and possible future competitors also include firms that have or may in the future elect to compete by means of open source licensing these competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes price reductions andor increased operating costs and could result in lower revenues margins and net income 

proprietary rights and licenses 

the company regards its software as proprietary and relies on a combination of trade secret copyright patent and trademark laws license agreements nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect its proprietary rights in its products the company distributes its software products under software license agreements that grant customers nonexclusive licenses which are typically nontransferable for the use of the companys products license agreements for the companys products are directly between the company and endusers use of the licensed software product is restricted to specified sites unless the customer obtains a multisite license for its use of the software product software security measures are also employed to prevent unauthorized use of the companys software products and the licensed software is subject to terms and conditions prohibiting unauthorized reproduction customers may purchase a perpetual license of the technology with the right to annually purchase ongoing maintenance technical support and upgrades or may lease the product on a fixedterm basis for a fee that includes the license maintenance technical support and upgrades 

the company licenses its software products utilizing a combination of webbased and hard copy license terms and forms for certain software products the company primarily relies on clickwrapped licenses the enforceability of these types of agreements under the laws of some jurisdictions is uncertain 

the company also seeks to protect the source code of its software as a trade secret and as unpublished copyrighted work the company has obtained federal trademark registration protection for ansys and other marks in the us and in foreign countries additionally the company was awarded numerous patents by the us patent and trademark office and has a number of patent applications pending to the extent the company does not choose to seek patent protection for its intellectual property the company primarily relies on the protection of its source code as a trade secret 

employees of the company have signed agreements under which they have agreed not to disclose trade secrets or confidential information and where legally permitted that restrict engagement in or connection with any business that is competitive with the company anywhere in the world while employed by the company and in some cases for specified periods thereafter and that any products or technology created by them during their term of employment are the property of the company in addition the company requires all channel partners to enter into agreements not to disclose the companys trade secrets and other proprietary information 

despite these precautions there can be no assurance that misappropriation of the companys technology and proprietary information including source code will not occur further there can be no assurance that copyright trademark patent and trade secret protection will be available for the companys products in certain jurisdictions or that restrictions on the ability of employees and channel partners to engage in activities competitive with the company will be enforceable costly and timeconsuming litigation could be necessary in the future to enforce the companys rights to its trade secrets and proprietary information or to enforce its patent rights and copyrights and it is possible that in the future the companys competitors may be able to obtain the companys trade secrets or to independently develop unpatented technology similar to the companys 

the software development industry is characterized by rapid technological change therefore the company believes that factors such as the technological and creative skills of its personnel new product developments frequent product enhancements name recognition and reliable product maintenance are also important to establishing and maintaining technology leadership in addition to the various legal protections of its technology that may be available 

the company does not believe that any of its products infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties there can be no assurance however that third parties will not claim such infringement by the company or its licensors or licensees with respect to current or future products the company expects that software suppliers will increasingly be subject to the risk of such claims as the number of products and suppliers continues to expand and the functionality of products continues to increase any such claims with or without merit could be time consuming result in costly litigation cause product shipment delays or require the company to enter into royalty or licensing agreements such royalty or licensing agreements if required may not be available on terms acceptable to the company 

seasonal variations 

the companys business has experienced seasonality including quarterly reductions in software sales resulting from slowdowns of customer activities during the summer months particularly in europe as well as from the seasonal purchasing and budgeting patterns of the companys global customers the companys revenue is typically highest in the fourth quarter 

deferred revenue and backlog 

deferred revenue consists of billings made or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from lease license and maintenance agreements the deferred revenue on the companys consolidated balance sheets does not represent the total value of annual or multiyear noncancellable lease license and maintenance agreements the companys backlog represents installment billings for periods beyond the current quarterly billing cycle and customer orders received but not invoiced the companys deferred revenue and backlog as of   december 31 2013  and 2012  consisted of the following 





revenue associated with deferred revenue and backlog that will be recognized in the subsequent twelve months is classified as current in the table above 

employees 

as of december 31 2013  the company and its subsidiaries had approximately 2600  employees at that date there were also contract personnel and coop students providing ongoing development services and technical support certain employees of the company are subject to collective bargaining agreements and have local work councils 

acquisitions 

the company makes targeted acquisitions in order to support its longterm strategic direction accelerate innovation provide increased capabilities to its existing products supply new products and services expand its customer base and enhance its distribution channels the following table presents the companys acquisitions since january 1 2011

risk factors 

tableend information provided by the company or its spokespersons including information contained in this annual report on form 10k may from time to time contain forwardlooking statements concerning projected financial performance market and industry sector growth product development and commercialization or other aspects of future operations such statements will be based on the assumptions and expectations of the companys management at the time such statements are made the company cautions investors that its performance and therefore any forwardlooking statement is subject to risks and uncertainties various important factors including but not limited to the following may cause the companys future results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statement 

global economic conditions   the companys operations and performance depend significantly on foreign and domestic economic conditions though the global economy has improved uncertainty about the depth and timing of the recovery remains in both foreign and domestic markets uncertainty regarding these economic conditions may negatively impact the company as customers defer spending in response to tighter credit higher unemployment financial market volatility government austerity programs negative financial news declining valuations of investments and other factors in addition certain of the companys customers budgets may be constrained and they may be unable to purchase the companys products at the same level as prior periods the companys customers ability to pay for the companys products and services may also be impaired which may lead to an increase in the companys allowance for doubtful accounts and writeoffs of accounts receivable since the company is exposed to the majority of major world markets uncertainty in any significant market may negatively impact the companys performance and results particularly with respect to the companys largest geographic customer bases the company is unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the current economic conditions or the likelihood of additional uncertainty arising in any of the companys key markets should these conditions result in the company not meeting its revenue growth objectives the companys operating results cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 

decline in customers business   the companys sales are based significantly on enduser demand for products in key industrial sectors many of these sectors periodically experience economic declines which may be exacerbated by other economic factors these factors may also adversely affect the companys business by extending sales cycles and reducing revenue these economic factors may cause the companys customers to reduce the size of their workforce or cut back on operations and may lead to a reduction in renewals of licenses or maintenance contracts with the company the companys customers may request discounts or extended payment terms on new products or seek to extend payment terms on existing contracts all of which may cause fluctuations in the companys future operating results the company may not be able to adjust its operating expenses to offset such fluctuations because a substantial portion of the companys operating expenses is related to personnel facilities and marketing programs the level of personnel and related expenses may not be able to be adjusted quickly and is based in significant part on the companys expectation for future revenue 

risks associated with international activities a majority of the companys business comes from outside the united states and the company has customers that supply a wide spectrum of goods and services in virtually all of the worlds major economic regions as the company continues to expand its sales presence in international regions the portion of its revenue expenses cash accounts receivable and payment obligations denominated in foreign currencies continues to increase if any of the foreign economies in which the company does business deteriorate or suffer periods of uncertainty the companys business and performance may be negatively impacted through reduced customer spending changes in purchasing cycles or timing reduced access to credit for its customers or other factors impacting the companys international sales and collections 

as a result of its increasing international activities the company has revenue expenses cash accounts receivable and payment obligations denominated in foreign currencies as a result the company is subject to currency exchange risk the companys revenues and operating results are adversely affected when the us dollar strengthens relative to other currencies and are positively affected when the us dollar weakens as a result changes in currency exchange rates will affect the companys financial position results of operations and cash flows in the event that there are economic declines in countries in which the company conducts transactions the resulting changes in currency exchange rates may affect the companys financial position results of operations and cash flows the company is most impacted by movements in and among the euro british pound japanese yen indian rupee korean won and the us dollar the company seeks to reduce these risks primarily through its normal operating and treasury activities but there can be no assurance that it will be successful in reducing these risks 

additional risks inherent in the companys international business activities include imposition of government controls export license requirements restrictions on the export of critical technology products and services the violation of anticorruption laws and regulations which are applicable to the company by third parties in countries where such conduct may be permissible or commonplace political and economic instability trade restrictions changes in tariffs and taxes difficulties in staffing and managing international operations longer accounts receivable payment cycles and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations effective patent copyright trademark and trade secret protection may not be available in every foreign country in which the company sells its products and services the companys business financial position results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks 

stock market and stock price volatility  market prices for securities of software companies have generally been volatile in particular the market price of the companys common stock has been and may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations as a result of factors affecting the company the software industry or the securities markets in general such factors include but are not limited to declines in trading price that may be triggered by the companys failure to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors moreover the trading price could be subject to additional fluctuations in response to quartertoquarter variations in the companys operating results material announcements made by the company or its competitors conditions in the financial markets or the software industry generally or other events and factors many of which are beyond the companys control 

rapidly changing technology new products risk of product errors the company operates in an industry generally characterized by rapidly changing technology and frequent new product introductions which can render existing products obsolete or unmarketable a major factor in the companys future success will be its ability to anticipate technological changes and to develop and introduce in a timely manner enhancements to its existing products products acquired in acquisitions and new products to meet those changes if the company is unable to introduce new products and to respond quickly to industry changes its business financial position results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

the introduction and marketing of new or enhanced products require the company to manage the transition from existing products in order to minimize disruption in customer purchasing patterns there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing and marketing on a timely basis new products or product enhancements that its new products will adequately address the changing needs of the marketplace or that it will successfully manage the transition from existing products software products as complex as those offered by the company may contain undetected errors when first introduced or as new versions are released and the likelihood of errors is increased as a result of the companys commitment to the frequency of its product releases there can be no assurance that errors will not be found in any new or enhanced products after commencement of commercial shipments certain products require a higher level of sales and support expertise the ability of the companys sales channel particularly the indirect channel to obtain this expertise and to sell the new product offerings effectively could have an adverse impact on the companys sales in future periods any of these problems may result in the loss of or delay in customer acceptance diversion of development resources damage to the companys reputation or increased service and warranty costs any of which could have a material adverse effect on the companys business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

product quality the company has separate quality systems and registrations under the iso 90012008 standard in addition to other governmental and industrial regulations the company’s continued compliance with quality standards and favorable outcomes in periodic examinations is important to retain current customers and vital to procure new sales if the company was determined not to be compliant with various regulatory or iso 90019000 standards its certificates of registration could be suspended requiring remedial action and a timeconsuming reregistration process product quality issues or failures could result in the company’s reputation becoming diminished resulting in a material adverse impact on revenue operating margins net income financial position and cash flows 

competition  the company continues to experience competition across all markets for its products and services some of the companys current and possible future competitors have greater financial technical marketing and other resources than the company and some have well established relationships with current and potential customers of the company the companys current and possible future competitors also include firms that have or may in the future elect to compete by means of open source licensing parties among the companys current or future strategic alliances including existing geometry partnerships may diminish or sever technical software development and marketing relationships with the company for competitive purposes these competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes price reductions andor increased operating costs and could result in lower revenues margins and net income 

changes in the companys pricing models the intense competition the company faces in the sales of its products and services and general economic and business conditions can put pressure on the company to adjust its prices if the companys competitors offer deep discounts on certain products or services or develop products that the marketplace considers more valuable the company may need to lower prices or offer discounts or other favorable terms in order to compete successfully any such changes may reduce operating margins and could adversely affect operating results the companys software license updates and product support fees are generally priced as a percentage of its new software license fees the companys competitors may offer lower percentage pricing on product updates and support that could put pressure on the company to further discount its new license or product support prices 

any broadbased change to the companys prices and pricing policies could cause new software license and service revenues to decline or be delayed as its sales force implements and its customers adjust to the new pricing policies some of the companys competitors may bundle software products for promotional purposes or as a longterm pricing strategy or provide guarantees of prices product implementations or wider geographical license usage provisions these practices could over time significantly constrain the prices that the company can charge for certain of its products if the company does not adapt its pricing models to reflect changes in customer use of its products or changes in customer demand the companys new software license revenues could decrease additionally increased distribution of applications through application service providers including softwareasaservice providers may reduce the average price for the companys products or adversely affect other sales of the companys products reducing new software license revenues unless the company can offset price reductions with volume increases the increase in open source software distribution may also cause the company to adjust its pricing models 

dependence on senior management and key technical personnel  the companys success depends upon the continued services of the companys senior executives key technical employees and other employees each of the companys executive officers key technical personnel and other employees could terminate his or her relationship with the company at any time the loss of any of the companys senior executives might significantly delay or prevent the achievement of the companys business objectives and could materially harm the companys business and customer relationships 

in addition because of the highly technical nature of the companys products the company must attract and retain highly skilled engineering and development personnel many of whom are recruited from outside of the united states the market for this talent is highly competitive the company is limited in its ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws if the company has less success in recruiting and retaining key personnel the companys business reputation and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 

dependence on proprietary technology  the companys success is highly dependent upon its proprietary technology the company generally relies on contracts and the laws of copyright patents trademarks and trade secrets to protect its technology the company maintains a trade secrets program enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees and channel partners and limits access to and distribution of its software documentation and other proprietary information there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company to protect its proprietary technology will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of its technology by third parties or that third parties will not be able to develop similar technology independently costly and timeconsuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of trade secret rights and related confidentiality and nondisclosure provisions although the company is not aware that any of its technology infringes upon the rights of third parties there can be no assurance that other parties will not assert technology infringement claims against the company or that if asserted such claims will not prevail 

risks associated with security of the companys products source code and it systems the company makes significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of its products source code and computer systems and data despite significant efforts to create security barriers to such programs it is virtually impossible for the company to entirely mitigate this risk there appears to be an increasing number of computer “hackers” developing and deploying a variety of destructive software programs such as viruses worms and the like that could attack the companys products and computer systems like all software products the companys software is vulnerable to such attacks the impact of such an attack could disrupt the proper functioning of the companys software products cause errors in the output of its customers work allow unauthorized access to sensitive proprietary or confidential information of the companys or its customers and other destructive outcomes if this were to occur the companys reputation may suffer customers may stop buying its products it could face lawsuits and potential liability and its financial performance could be negatively impacted 

there is also a danger of industrial espionage cyberattacks misuse theft of information or assets including source code or damage to assets by people who have gained unauthorized access to the companys facilities systems or information such cybersecurity breaches misuse or other disruptions could lead to the disclosure of portions of the companys product source code or other confidential information improper usage and distribution of its products without compensation illegal usage of its products which could jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through its computer systems theft manipulation and destruction of private and proprietary data resulting in defective products and production downtimes although the company actively employs measures to combat unlicensed copying access and use of software and intellectual property through a variety of techniques preventing unauthorized use or infringement of the companys rights is inherently difficult these events could adversely affect the companys financial results or could result in significant claims for damages against it and participating in lawsuits to protect against any such unauthorized access to usage of or disclosure of any of our products or any portion of the companys product source code or in prosecutions in connection with any such cybersecurity breach could be costly and timeconsuming and may divert managements attention and adversely affect the markets perception of the company and its products 

policing the unauthorized distribution and use of the companys products is difficult and software piracy including online piracy is a persistent problem the proliferation of technology designed to circumvent typical software protection measures used in the companys products and the possibility that methods of circumventing the techniques it employs in its products may lead to an expansion in piracy or misuse of its products and intellectual property as a result and despite the companys efforts to prevent such activities and to prosecute instances of such activities the company may nonetheless lose significant revenue due to illegal use of its software and managements attention may be diverted to address specific instances of piracy or misuse or address piracy and misuse in general 

a number of the companys core processes such as software development sales and marketing customer service and financial transactions rely on its it infrastructure and applications malicious software sabotage and other cybersecurity breaches of the types discussed above could cause an outage of the companys infrastructure which could lead to a substantial denial of service and ultimately to production downtime recovery costs and customer claims this could have a significant negative impact on the companys business financial position profit or cash flows 

the company has implemented a number of measures designed to ensure the security of its information it resources and other assets nonetheless unauthorized users could gain access to its systems through cyberattacks and steal use without authorization and sabotage our intellectual property and confidential data any breach of its it security misuse or theft could lead to loss of production to recovery costs or to litigation brought by employees customers or business partners which could have a significant negative impact on the companys business financial position profit cash flows and reputation 

dependence on channel partners  the company continues to distribute a meaningful portion of its products through its global network of independent regional channel partners the channel partners sell the companys software products to new and existing customers expand installations within the existing customer base offer consulting services and provide the first line of technical support consequently in certain geographies the company is highly dependent upon the efforts of the channel partners difficulties in ongoing relationships with channel partners such as failure to meet performance criteria or to promote the companys products as aggressively as the company expects and differences in the handling of customer relationships could adversely affect the companys performance additionally the loss of any major channel partner for any reason including a channel partners decision to sell competing products rather than the companys products could have a material adverse effect on the company moreover the companys future success will depend substantially on the ability and willingness of its channel partners to continue to dedicate the resources necessary to promote the companys portfolio of products and to support a larger installed base of the companys products if the channel partners are unable or unwilling to do so the company may be unable to sustain revenue growth 

during times of significant fluctuations in world currencies certain channel partners may have solvency issues to the extent that effective hedge transactions are not employed or there is not sufficient working capital in particular if the us dollar strengthens relative to other currencies certain channel partners who pay the company in us dollars may have trouble paying the company on time or may have trouble distributing the companys products due to the impact of the currency exchange fluctuation on such channel partners cash flows this may impact the companys ability to distribute its products into certain regions and markets and may have an adverse effect on the companys results of operations and cash flows 

reliance on perpetual licenses  although the company has historically maintained stable recurring revenue from the sale of software lease licenses and software maintenance subscriptions it also has relied on sales of perpetual licenses that involve payment of a single upfront fee and that are more typical in the computer software industry while revenue generated from software lease licenses and software maintenance subscriptions currently represents a portion of the companys revenue to the extent that perpetual license revenue continues to represent a significant percentage of total revenue the companys revenue in any period will depend significantly on sales completed during that period 

renewal rates for annual lease and maintenance contracts a substantial portion of the companys license and maintenance revenue is derived from annual lease and maintenance contracts these contracts are generally renewed on an annual basis and typically have a high rate of customer renewal in addition to the recurring revenue base associated with these contracts a majority of customers purchasing new perpetual licenses also purchase related annual maintenance contracts if the rate of renewal for these contracts is adversely affected by economic or other factors the companys license and maintenance growth will be adversely affected over the term that the revenue for those contracts would have otherwise been recognized as a result the companys business financial position results of operations and cash flows may also be adversely impacted during those periods 

risks associated with acquisitions  historically the company has consummated acquisitions in order to support the companys longterm strategic direction accelerate innovation provide increased capabilities to existing products supply new products and services expand its customer base and enhance its distribution channels the company has completed a number of acquisitions in recent years and expects to make additional acquisitions in the future but may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or if suitable candidates are identified the company may not be able to complete the business combination on commercially acceptable terms the process of exploring and pursuing acquisition opportunities may result in devotion of significant management and financial resources 

even if the company is able to consummate acquisitions that it believes will be successful such transactions present many risks including among others failing to achieve anticipated synergies and revenue increases difficulty incorporating and integrating the acquired technologies or products with the companys existing product lines difficulty in coordinating establishing or expanding sales distribution and marketing functions as necessary disruption of the companys ongoing business and diversion of managements attention to transition or integration issues unanticipated and unknown liabilities the loss of key employees customers partners and channel partners of the company or of the acquired company and difficulties implementing and maintaining sufficient controls policies and procedures over the systems products and processes of the acquired company if the company does not achieve the anticipated benefits of its acquisitions as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by the companys management and financial or industry analysts or if others do not perceive the same benefits of the acquisition as the company there could be a material adverse effect on the companys stock price business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in addition for companies acquired limited experience will exist for several quarters following the acquisition relating to how the acquired companys sales pipelines will convert into sales or revenues and the conversion rate postacquisition may be quite different than the historical conversion rate because a substantial portion of the companys sales are completed in the latter part of a quarter and its cost structure is largely fixed in the shortterm revenue shortfalls may have a negative impact on the companys profitability a delay in a small number of large new software license transactions could cause the companys quarterly software license revenues to fall significantly short of its predictions 

disruption of operations or infrastructure failures  a significant portion of the companys software development personnel source code and computer equipment is located at operating facilities in the united states canada india japan and throughout europe the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unforeseen catastrophe at any of these facilities could cause interruptions in the companys operations services and product development activities additionally if the company experiences problems that impair its business infrastructure such as a computer virus telephone system failure or an intentional disruption of its information technology systems by a third party these interruptions could have a material adverse effect on the companys business financial position results of operations cash flows and the ability to meet financial reporting deadlines further because the companys sales are not generally linear during any quarterly period the potential adverse effects resulting from any of the events described above or any other disruption of the companys business could be accentuated if it occurs close to the end of a fiscal quarter 

sales forecasts   the company makes many operational and strategic decisions based upon short and longterm sales forecasts the companys sales personnel continually monitor the status of all proposals including the estimated closing date and the value of the sale in order to forecast quarterly sales these forecasts are subject to significant estimation and are impacted by many external factors including global economic conditions and the performance of the companys customers a variation in actual sales activity from that forecasted could cause the company to plan or to budget incorrectly and therefore could adversely affect the companys business financial position results of operations and cash flows the companys management team forecasts macroeconomic trends and developments and integrates them through longrange planning into budgets research and development strategies and a wide variety of general management duties global economic conditions and the effect those conditions and other disruptions in global markets have on the companys customers may have a significant impact on the accuracy of the companys sales forecasts these conditions may increase the likelihood or the magnitude of variations between actual sales activity and the companys sales forecasts and as a result the companys performance may be hindered because of a failure to properly match corporate strategy with economic conditions this in turn may adversely affect the companys business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

risks associated with significant sales to existing customers  a significant portion of the companys sales includes followon sales to existing customers that invest in the companys broad suite of engineering simulation software and services if a significant number of current customers were to become dissatisfied with the companys products and services or choose to license or utilize competitive offerings the companys followon sales and recurring lease and maintenance revenues could be materially adversely impacted resulting in reduced revenue operating margins net income and cash flows 

income tax estimates   the company makes significant estimates in determining its worldwide income tax provision these estimates involve complex tax regulations in a number of jurisdictions across the companys global operations and are subject to many transactions and calculations in which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain the final outcome of tax matters could be different than the estimates reflected in the historical income tax provision and related accruals such differences could have a material impact on income tax expense and net income in the periods in which such determinations are made 

the amount of income tax paid by the company is subject to ongoing audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities these audits can often result in additional assessments including interest and penalties the companys estimate for liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions is highly judgmental and actual future outcomes may result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to the companys estimated tax liabilities including estimates for uncertain tax positions in the period the assessments are made or resolved audits are closed or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire as a result the companys effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly or annual basis 

the company allocates a portion of its purchase price to goodwill and intangible assets impairment charges associated with goodwill are generally not tax deductible and will result in an increased effective income tax rate in the period the impairment is recorded the company has recorded significant deferred tax liabilities related to acquired intangible assets that are not deductible for tax purposes these deferred tax liabilities are based on future statutory tax rates in the locations in which the intangible assets are recorded any future changes in statutory tax rates would be recorded as an adjustment to the deferred tax liabilities in the period the change is announced and could have a material impact on the companys effective tax rate during that period 

periodic reorganization of sales force  the company relies heavily on its direct sales force from time to time the company reorganizes and makes adjustments to its sales leadership andor its sales force in response to such factors as management changes performance issues market opportunities and other considerations these changes may result in a temporary lack of sales production and may adversely impact revenue in future quarters there can be no assurance that the company will not restructure its sales force in future periods or that the transition issues associated with such a restructuring will not occur 

regulatory compliance   like all other public companies the company is subject to the rules and regulations of the sec including those that require the company to report on and receive an attestation from its independent registered public accounting firm regarding the companys internal control over financial reporting compliance with these requirements causes the company to incur additional expenses and causes management to divert time from the daytoday operations of the company while the company anticipates being able to fully comply with these requirements if it is not able to comply with the sarbanesoxley reporting or attestation requirements relating to internal control over financial reporting the company may be subject to sanctions by the sec or nasdaq such sanctions could divert the attention of the companys management from implementing its business plan and could have an adverse effect on the companys business and results of operations 

as the companys stock is listed on the nasdaq global select market the company is subject to the ongoing financial and corporate governance requirements of nasdaq while the company anticipates being able to fully comply with these requirements if it is not able to comply the companys name may be published on nasdaqs daily noncompliant companies list until nasdaq determines that it has regained compliance or the company no longer trades on nasdaq if the company were unable to return to compliance with the governance requirements of nasdaq the company may be delisted from the nasdaq global select market which could have an adverse effect on the market value of the companys equity securities and the ability to raise additional capital 

governmental revenue sources the companys sales to the united states government must comply with federal acquisition regulations failure to comply with these regulations could result in penalties being assessed against the company or an order preventing the company from making future sales to the united states government further the companys international activities must comply with the export control laws of the united states and other countries the foreign corrupt practices act the united kingdom bribery act of 2010 and a variety of other laws and regulations of the united states and other countries in which the company operates failure to comply with any of these laws and regulations could adversely affect the companys business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

in certain circumstances the united states government state and local governments and their respective agencies and certain foreign governments may have the right to terminate contractual arrangements at any time without cause the united states european union and certain other government contracts as well as the companys state and local level contracts are subject to the approval of appropriations or funding authorizations certain of these contracts permit the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions including but not limited to termination of contracts refund of a portion of fees received forfeiture of profits suspension of payments fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business any of which could have an adverse effect on the companys results of operations and cash flows 

contingencies   the company is subject to various investigations claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business including alleged infringement of intellectual property rights commercial disputes labor and employment matters tax audits and other matters each of these matters is subject to various uncertainties and it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could materially affect the companys results of operations cash flows or financial position 

changes in existing financial accounting standards changes in existing accounting rules or practices new accounting pronouncements or varying interpretations of current accounting pronouncements could have a significant adverse effect on the companys results of operations or the manner in which the company conducts its business 

changes in tax law the companys operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions a change in the tax law in the jurisdictions in which the company does business including an increase in tax rates or an adverse change in the treatment of an item of income or expense could result in a material increase in tax expense currently a substantial portion of the companys revenue is generated from customers located outside the united states and a substantial portion of assets are located outside the united states united states income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings for nonunited states subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries changes in existing taxation rules or practices new taxation rules or varying interpretations of current taxation practices could have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations or the manner in which the company conducts its business 

the company has significant operations in india there have been court rulings concerning certain indian tax laws that have been inconsistent with tax positions taken by the company and inconsistent with the advice provided to the company by its tax advisors 

an indian subsidiary of the company received a formal inquiry after a service tax audit the service tax issues raised in the company’s notice are very similar to the case ms microsoft corporation i p ltd vs commissions of service tax  currently being appealed to the delhi customs excise and service tax appellate tribunal cestat if the ruling is in favor of microsoft the company expects a similar outcome for its audit case if the ruling is unfavorable in the case of microsoft the company could incur tax charges and related liabilities including those related to the service tax audit case of 6 million  of the two judicial members assigned to the microsoft appeal one member has ruled in favor of microsoft and one has ruled in favor of the commission a third deciding judge will be appointed for a final decision the company can provide no assurances as to the outcome of the microsoft appeal or to the impact of the microsoft appeal on the company’s audit case the company is uncertain as to when the service tax audit will be completed 

other court cases are pending in india that could have a material impact on the companys financial position results of operations or cash flows if the ultimate outcome of those cases is similarly inconsistent with tax positions taken by the company

results of operations 

for purposes of the following discussion and analysis the table below sets forth certain consolidated financial data for the years 2013  2012  and 2011  the operating results of esterel and apache have been included in the results of operations since their respective acquisition dates of august 1 2012 and 2011

revenue 



the company’s revenue increased 79  in 2013  as compared to 2012  including increases in all major revenue categories the companys revenue included esterel operations for the full year in 2013 of 188 million  as compared to five months in 2012 of 33 million  the growth was partially influenced by benefits from the company’s continued investment in its global sales and marketing organization annual maintenance contracts that were sold with new perpetual licenses along with maintenance contracts sold with new perpetual licenses in previous years contributed to maintenance revenue growth of 122  revenue from lease licenses increased 66  as compared to the prior year due to an increase in apacherelated lease license revenue and growth in sales of other lease licenses perpetual license revenue which is derived entirely from new sales during the period increased 39  as compared to the prior year due to increased perpetual license sales across most product lines as well as a full year of esterel activity in 2013 as compared to five months in 2012 service revenue increased 125  as compared to the prior year due to an increase in engineering consulting projects 

with respect to revenue on average for the year ended december 31 2013  the us dollar was 40  stronger when measured against the company’s primary foreign currencies than for the year ended december 31 2012  the net overall strengthening primarily related to the japanese yen resulted in decreased revenue and operating income during 2013  as compared to 2012  of 176 million  and 122 million  respectively 

a substantial portion of the company’s license and maintenance revenue is derived from annual lease and maintenance contracts these contracts are generally renewed on an annual basis and typically have a high rate of customer renewal in addition to the recurring revenue base associated with these contracts a majority of customers purchasing new perpetual licenses also purchase related annual maintenance contracts as a result of the significant recurring revenue base the company’s license and maintenance revenue growth rate in any period does not necessarily correlate to the growth rate of new license and maintenance contracts sold during that period to the extent the rate of customer renewal for lease and maintenance contracts is high incremental lease contracts and maintenance contracts sold with new perpetual licenses will result in license and maintenance revenue growth conversely if the rate of renewal for these contracts is adversely affected by economic or other factors the company’s license and maintenance growth will be adversely affected over the term that the revenue for those contracts would have otherwise been recognized 

international and domestic revenues as a percentage of total revenue were 661  and 339  respectively during the year ended december 31 2013  and 667  and 333  respectively during the year ended december 31 2012  the company derived 253  and 260  of its total revenue through the indirect sales channel for the years ended december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively 

in valuing deferred revenue on the esterel and apache balance sheets as of their respective acquisition dates the company applied the fair value provisions applicable to the accounting for business combinations resulting in lower amounts of revenue than esterel and apache would have recognized absent the acquisitions the impact on reported revenue for the year ended december 31 2013  was 46 million  the expected impact on reported revenue is 04 million  and 14 million  for the quarter ending march 31 2014  and the year ending december 31 2014  respectively 

cost of sales and gross profit 



software licenses  the increase in software license costs was primarily due to the following 

 amortization  the decrease in amortization expense was primarily due to a net decrease in amortization of acquired technology

 the improvement in gross profit was a result of the increase in revenue offset by a smaller increase in related cost of sales 

operating expenses 



selling general and administrative  the increase in selling general and administrative costs was primarily due to the following 

 the company anticipates that it will continue to make targeted investments in its global sales and marketing organization and its global business infrastructure to enhance major account sales activities and to support its worldwide sales distribution and marketing strategies and the business in general 

research and development  the increase in research and development costs was primarily due to the following

in the us which is the largest jurisdiction where the company receives such a tax credit the availability of the research and development credit expired at the end of the 2011 tax year in january 2013 the us congress passed legislation that reinstated the research and development credit retroactive to 2012 the income tax provision for the year ended december 31 2013 includes approximately 23 million related to the reinstated research and development credit for 2012 activity the 2014 research and development credit is currently not available unless legislation is passed by the us congress 

the decrease in the effective tax rate from the prior year is primarily due to the release of an uncertain tax position mentioned above the reinstatement of the us research and development credit mentioned above and cash repatriation activities when compared to the federal and state combined statutory rate the effective tax rates for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 were favorably impacted by lower statutory tax rates in many of the company’s foreign jurisdictions the domestic manufacturing deduction and tax benefits associated with the merger of the company’s japan subsidiaries in 2010

with respect to revenue on average for the year ended december 31 2012 the us dollar was 37 stronger when measured against the company’s primary foreign currencies than for the year ended december 31 2011 the net overall strengthening of the us dollar resulted in decreased revenue and operating income during 2012 as compared to 2011 of 154 million and 74 million respectively

nongaap results 

the company provides nongaap revenue nongaap operating income nongaap operating profit margin nongaap net income and nongaap diluted earnings per share as supplemental measures to gaap measures regarding the company’s operational performance these financial measures exclude the impact of certain items and therefore have not been calculated in accordance with gaap a detailed explanation and a reconciliation of each nongaap financial measure to its most comparable gaap financial measure are described below 

 note the 2013 gaap and nongaap net income and earnings per share data reflected above include 110 million of incremental tax benefit or 012 per diluted share related to the notification received from the irs that the joint committee on taxation took no exception to the companys tax returns that were filed for 2009 and 2010 thus effectively settling the uncertainty regarding refund claims filed in connection with these returns 



 note the 2011 gaap and nongaap net income and earnings per share data reflected above include 48 million or 005 per diluted share related to income tax expense associated with reductions to the japanese corporate tax rate beginning with the 2013 tax year this legislation enacted on november 30 2011 resulted in an additional 48 million in deferred tax expense due to the reduction in the value of certain net deferred tax assets of the companys japanese subsidiaries 

nongaap measures 

management uses nongaap financial measures a to evaluate the companys historical and prospective financial performance as well as its performance relative to its competitors b to set internal sales targets and spending budgets c to allocate resources d to measure operational profitability and the accuracy of forecasting e to assess financial discipline over operational expenditures and f as an important factor in determining variable compensation for management and its employees in addition many financial analysts that follow the company focus on and publish both historical results and future projections based on nongaap financial measures the company believes that it is in the best interest of its investors to provide this information to analysts so that they accurately report the nongaap financial information moreover investors have historically requested and the company has historically reported these nongaap financial measures as a means of providing consistent and comparable information with past reports of financial results 

while management believes that these nongaap financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors there are limitations associated with the use of these nongaap financial measures these nongaap financial measures are not prepared in accordance with gaap are not reported by all of the company’s competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of the company’s competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation the company compensates for these limitations by using these nongaap financial measures as supplements to gaap financial measures and by reviewing the reconciliations of the nongaap financial measures to their most comparable gaap financial measures 

the adjustments to these nongaap financial measures and the basis for such adjustments are outlined below 

acquisition accounting for deferred revenue and its related tax impact historically the company has consummated acquisitions in order to support its strategic and other business objectives in accordance with the fair value provisions applicable to the accounting for business combinations acquired deferred revenue is often recorded on the opening balance sheet at an amount that is lower than the historical carrying value although this purchase accounting requirement has no impact on the company’s business or cash flow it adversely impacts the company’s reported gaap revenue in the reporting periods following an acquisition in order to provide investors with financial information that facilitates comparison of both historical and future results the company provides nongaap financial measures which exclude the impact of the acquisition accounting adjustment the company believes that this nongaap financial adjustment is useful to investors because it allows investors to a evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in its financial and operational decisionmaking and b compare past and future reports of financial results of the company as the revenue reduction related to acquired deferred revenue will not recur when related annual lease licenses and software maintenance contracts are renewed in future periods 

amortization of intangibles from acquisitions and its related tax impact the company incurs amortization of intangibles included in its gaap presentation of amortization expense related to various acquisitions it has made in recent years management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating nongaap operating income nongaap operating profit margin nongaap net income and nongaap diluted earnings per share when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the company because these costs are fixed at the time of an acquisition are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition accordingly management does not consider these expenses for purposes of evaluating the performance of the company during the applicable time period after the acquisition and it excludes such expenses when making decisions to allocate resources the company believes that these nongaap financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to a evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in its financial and operational decisionmaking and b compare past reports of financial results of the company as the company has historically reported these nongaap financial measures 

stockbased compensation expense and its related tax impact  the company incurs expense related to stockbased compensation included in its gaap presentation of cost of software licenses cost of maintenance and service research and development expense and selling general and administrative expense although stockbased compensation is an expense of the company and viewed as a form of compensation management excludes these expenses for the purpose of calculating nongaap operating income nongaap operating profit margin nongaap net income and nongaap diluted earnings per share when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the company specifically the company excludes stockbased compensation during its annual budgeting process and its quarterly and annual assessments of the company’s and management’s performance the annual budgeting process is the primary mechanism whereby the company allocates resources to various initiatives and operational requirements additionally the annual review by the board of directors during which it compares the companys historical business model and profitability to the planned business model and profitability for the forthcoming year excludes the impact of stockbased compensation in evaluating the performance of senior management and department managers charges related to stockbased compensation are excluded from expenditure and profitability results in fact the company records stockbased compensation expense into a standalone cost center for which no single operational manager is responsible or accountable in this way management is able to review on a periodtoperiod basis each manager’s performance and assess financial discipline over operational expenditures without the effect of stockbased compensation the company believes that these nongaap financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to a evaluate the companys operating results and the effectiveness of the methodology used by management to review the companys operating results and b review historical comparability in the companys financial reporting as well as comparability with competitors operating results 

transaction costs related to business combinations the company incurs expenses for professional services rendered in connection with business combinations which are included in its gaap presentation of selling general and administrative expense these expenses are generally not tax deductible management excludes these acquisitionrelated transaction expenses for the purpose of calculating nongaap operating income nongaap operating profit margin nongaap net income and nongaap diluted earnings per share when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the company as it generally would not have otherwise incurred these expenses in the periods presented as a part of its continuing operations the company believes that these nongaap financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to a evaluate the companys operating results and the effectiveness of the methodology used by management to review the companys operating results and b review historical comparability in the companys financial reporting as well as comparability with competitors operating results 

nongaap financial measures are not in accordance with or an alternative for gaap the companys nongaap financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable gaap financial measures and should be read only in conjunction with the companys consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap 

the company has provided a reconciliation of the nongaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures as listed below 



liquidity and capital resources

if the foreign balances were repatriated to the us they would be subject to domestic tax resulting in a tax obligation in the period of repatriation in general it is the practice and intention of the company to repatriate previously taxed earnings and to reinvest all other earnings of its nonus subsidiaries the amount of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments held by foreign subsidiaries is subject to translation adjustments caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period the offset to which is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income on the company’s consolidated balance sheet 

working capital 

the increase in working capital is due primarily to the increase in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments realized through cash flows from operations 

cash flows from operating activities 



fiscal year 2013 as compared to fiscal year 2012 

cash flows from operations increased  during the current fiscal year due to increased  net income net of noncash operating adjustments of 393 million  and decreased  net cash flows from operating assets and liabilities of 48 million  

fiscal year 2012 as compared to fiscal year 2011 

cash flows from operations decreased  during the prior fiscal year due to decreased  net cash flows from operating assets and liabilities of 416 million  and increased  net income net of noncash operating adjustments of 323 million  

cash flows from investing activities 



fiscal year 2013 as compared to fiscal year 2012 

cash used in investing activities decreased  during the current fiscal year due primarily to decreased  acquisitionrelated cash outlays of 409 million  and increased  capital spending of 49 million  the company currently plans capital spending of 35 million to 45 million during fiscal year 2014 as compared to 288 million  in the current fiscal year the planned increase is attributable to costs associated with the companys new canonsburg pennsylvania headquarters facility expected to be completed in late 2014 the company has occupied its current headquarters facility since 1997 the level of spending will be dependent upon various factors including growth of the business and general economic conditions 

fiscal year 2012 as compared to fiscal year 2011

cash used in financing activities increased  during the current fiscal year due primarily to increased  treasury stock repurchases of 207 million  decreased  excess tax benefits from stock option exercises of 39 million  restricted stock withholding taxes paid in lieu of issued shares of 43 million  partially offset by decreased principal payments on longterm debt of 213 million  

under the company’s stock repurchase program the company repurchased 15 million  shares during the year ended december 31 2013  at an average price per share of 7773  for a total cost of 1161 million  as of december 31 2013  15 million  shares remain authorized for repurchase under the company’s stock repurchase program the company paid the outstanding balance of its term loan at maturity on july 31 2013

the company believes that existing cash and cash equivalent balances of 7425 million  together with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet the company’s working capital and capital expenditure requirements through the next twelve months the company’s cash requirements in the future may also be financed through additional equity or debt financings there can be no assurance that such financings can be obtained on favorable terms if at all 

the company continues to generate positive cash flows from operating activities and believes that the best use of its excess cash is to invest in the business and to repurchase stock in order to offset dilution and to return capital to stockholders in excess of our requirements with the goal of increasing stockholder value additionally the company has in the past and expects in the future to acquire or make investments in complementary companies products services and technologies any future acquisitions may be funded by available cash and investments cash generated from operations credit facilities or from the issuance of additional securities

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the company believes that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition  revenue is derived principally from the licensing of computer software products and from related maintenance contracts revenue from perpetual licenses is classified as license revenue and is recognized upon delivery of the licensed product and the utility that enables the customer to access authorization keys provided that acceptance has occurred and a signed contractual obligation has been received the price is fixed and determinable and collectibility of the receivable is probable the company determines the fair value of postcontract customer support pcs sold together with perpetual licenses based on the rate charged for pcs when sold separately revenue from pcs contracts is classified as maintenance and service revenue and is recognized ratably over the term of the contract 

revenue for software lease licenses is classified as license revenue and is recognized over the period of the lease contract typically the company’s software leases include pcs which due to the short term principally one year or less of the company’s software lease licenses cannot be separated from lease revenue for accounting purposes as a result both the lease license and pcs are recognized ratably over the lease period due to the shortterm nature of the software lease licenses and the frequency with which the company provides major product upgrades typically every 12–18 months the company does not believe that a significant portion of the fee paid under the arrangement is attributable to the pcs component of the arrangement and as a result includes the revenue for the entire arrangement within software license revenue in the consolidated statements of income 

the companys apache products are typically licensed via longer term leases of 24–36 months the company recognizes revenue for these licenses over the term of the lease contract because the company does not have vendorspecific objective evidence of the fair value of these leases the company also recognizes revenue from perpetual licenses over the term of the lease contract during the infrequent occurrence of these licenses being sold with apache leases in multipleelement arrangements 

revenue from training support and other services is recognized as the services are performed the company applies the specific performance method to contracts in which the service consists of a single act such as providing a training class to a customer and the proportional performance method to other service contracts that are longer in duration and often include multiple acts for example both training and consulting in applying the proportional performance method the company typically utilizes outputbased estimates for services with contractual billing arrangements that are not based on time and materials and estimates output based on the total tasks completed as compared to the total tasks required for each work contract inputbased estimates are utilized for services that involve general consultations with contractual billing arrangements based on time and materials utilizing direct labor as the input measure 

the company also executes arrangements through independent channel partners in which the channel partners are authorized to market and distribute the company’s software products to endusers of the company’s products and services in specified territories in sales facilitated by channel partners the channel partner bears the risk of collection from the enduser customer the company recognizes revenue from transactions with channel partners when the channel partner submits a written purchase commitment collectibility from the channel partner is probable a signed license agreement is received from the enduser customer and delivery has occurred provided that all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied revenue from channel partner transactions is the amount remitted to the company by the channel partners this amount includes a fee for pcs that is compensation for providing technical enhancements and the second level of technical support to the enduser which is based on the rate charged for pcs when sold separately and is recognized over the period that pcs is to be provided the company does not offer right of return product rotation or price protection to any of its channel partners 

nonincome related taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as accounts receivable and accrued expenses the collection and payment of these amounts are reported on a net basis in the consolidated statements of income and do not impact reported revenues or expenses 

the company warrants to its customers that its software will substantially perform as specified in the company’s most current user manuals the company has not experienced significant claims related to software warranties beyond the scope of maintenance support which the company is already obligated to provide and consequently the company has not established reserves for warranty obligations 

the company’s agreements with its customers generally require it to indemnify the customer against claims that the company’s software infringes thirdparty patent copyright trademark or other proprietary rights such indemnification obligations are generally limited in a variety of industrystandard respects including the company’s right to replace an infringing product as of december 31 2013  the company had not experienced any losses related to these indemnification obligations and no claims with respect thereto were outstanding the company does not expect significant claims related to these indemnification obligations and consequently the company has not established any related reserves 

allowance for doubtful accounts  the company makes judgments as to its ability to collect outstanding receivables and provides allowances for a portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices from both value and delinquency perspectives for those invoices not specifically reviewed provisions are provided at differing rates based upon the age of the receivable and the geographic area of origin in determining these percentages the company considers its historical collection experience and current economic trends in the customer’s industry and geographic region if the historical data used to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and future results of operations could be materially affected 

income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period of the enactment date 

the company records net deferred tax assets to the extent it believes these assets will more likely than not be realized in making such determination the company considers all available positive and negative evidence including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and recent financial operations in the event the company determines that it will be able to realize deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be recorded that would reduce the provision for income taxes 

tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a more likely than not threshold otherwise these tax benefits are recorded when a tax position has been effectively settled which means that the statute of limitations has expired or the appropriate taxing authority has completed their examination even though the statute of limitations remains open the company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the income tax expense line in the consolidated statements of income accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheets 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets the company tests goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment at least annually by performing a qualitative assessment of whether there is sufficient evidence that it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit or asset exceeds its carrying amount goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level and indefinitelived intangible assets are tested at the individual asset level the application of a qualitative assessment requires the company to assess and make judgments regarding a variety of factors which potentially impact the fair value of the reporting unit or asset being tested including general economic conditions industry and marketspecific conditions customer behavior cost factors the company’s financial performance and trends the company’s strategies and business plans capital requirements management and personnel issues and the company’s stock price among others the company then considers the totality of these and other factors placing more weight on the events and circumstances that are judged to most affect the reporting units or asset’s fair value and carrying amount to reach a qualitative conclusion regarding whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or asset is less than its carrying amount 

if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or asset exceeds its carrying value no further analysis is necessary if it is determined that it is more likely than not the reporting units or assets carrying value exceeds its fair value a quantitative twostep analysis is performed where the fair value of the reporting unit or asset is estimated and the impairment loss if any is recorded because there are inherent uncertainties involved in these factors the company’s estimates of fair value are imprecise and the resulting carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets may be misstated 

during the first quarter of 2013  the company completed the annual impairment test for goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets and determined that these assets had not been impaired as of the test date january 1 2013  the company performed qualitative assessments to test goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment and as of the test date there was sufficient evidence that it was not more likely than not that the fair values of its reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets were less than their carrying amounts 

contingencies   the company is involved in various investigations claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business including alleged infringement of intellectual property rights commercial disputes labor and employment matters tax audits and other matters the company reviews the status of these matters assesses its financial exposure and records a related accrual if the potential loss from an investigation claim or legal proceeding is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable significant judgment is involved in the determination of probability and in the determination of whether an exposure is reasonably estimable as a result of the uncertainties involved in making these estimates the company may have to revise its estimates as facts and circumstances change the revision of these estimates could have a material impact on the company’s financial position and results of operations 

stockbased compensation the company grants options and other stock awards to employees and directors under the company’s stock option and grant plan eligible employees can also purchase shares of the company’s common stock at a discount under the company’s employee stock purchase plan the benefits provided under these plans are sharebased payments subject to the provisions of sharebased payment accounting guidance the company uses the fair value method to apply the provisions of sharebased payment accounting guidance stockbased compensation expense for 2013  2012  and 2011  was 353 million  324 million  and 231 million  respectively as of december 31 2013  total unrecognized estimated compensation expense related to unvested stock options granted prior to that date was 399 million  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 17 years  

the value of each stockbased award was estimated on the date of grant or date of acquisition for options issued in a business combination using the blackscholes option pricing model “blackscholes model” the determination of the fair value of sharebased payment awards using an option pricing model is affected by the company’s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables these variables include the company’s expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors riskfree interest rates and expected dividends the table below presents the weighted average input assumptions used and resulting fair values for options granted or issued in business combinations during each respective year the stockbased compensation expense for options is recorded ratably over their requisite service period the interest rate assumptions were determined by using the fiveyear us treasury note yield on the date of grant or date of acquisition   



prior to 2012 the company issued both nonqualified and incentive stock options however the company no longer issues incentive stock options the tax benefits associated with the outstanding incentive stock options are unpredictable as they are predicated upon an award recipient triggering an event that disqualifies the award and that then results in a tax deduction to the company sharebased payment accounting guidance requires that these tax benefits be recorded at the time of the triggering event the triggering events for each option holder are not easily projected in order to estimate the tax benefits related to incentive stock options the company makes many assumptions and estimates including the number of incentive stock options that will be exercised during the period by us employees the number of incentive stock options that will be disqualified during the period and the fair market value of the company’s stock price on the exercise dates each of these items is subject to significant uncertainty additionally a significant portion of the tax benefits related to disqualified incentive stock options is accounted for as an increase to equity additional paidin capital rather than as a reduction in income tax expense although all such benefits continue to be realized through the company’s tax filings there is no corresponding benefit to income tax expense for example the company realized a tax benefit of 61 million  during the year ended december 31 2013 related to disqualified dispositions of incentive stock options however only 18 million  of such amount was recorded as a reduction in income tax expense 

under the terms of the ansys inc longterm incentive plan in the first quarter of 2013  2012  and 2011  the company granted 94300 100000 and 92500 performancebased restricted stock units respectively vesting of the full award or a portion thereof is based on the company’s performance as measured by total shareholder return relative to the median percentage appreciation of the nasdaq composite index over a specified measurement period subject to each participant’s continued employment with the company through the conclusion of the measurement period the measurement period for the restricted stock units granted pursuant to the longterm incentive plan is a threeyear period beginning january 1 of the year of the grant each restricted stock unit relates to one share of the company’s common stock the weighted average fair value of each restricted stock unit granted in 2013  2012  and 2011  was estimated on the grant date to be 5005 3316 and 3205 respectively the fair value of the restricted stock units was estimated using a monte carlo simulation model the determination of the fair value of the awards was affected by the grant date and a number of variables each of which has been identified in the chart below stockbased compensation expense based on the fair value of the award is being recorded from the grant date through the conclusion of the threeyear measurement period on december 31 2013  employees earned 92500 restricted stock units which will be issued in the first quarter of 2014 total compensation expense associated with the awards recorded for the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  was 36 million  26 million  and 16 million  respectively total compensation expense associated with granted awards for the years ending december 31 2014 and 2015 is expected to be 28 million  and 17 million  respectively 



in addition the company grants deferred stock units to nonaffiliate independent directors which are rights to receive shares of common stock upon termination of service as a director the deferred stock units are issued in arrears and vest immediately as of december 31 2013  115842 deferred stock units have been earned with the underlying shares remaining unissued until the service termination of the respective director owners of this amount 26215 units were earned during the year ended december 31 2013  

in accordance with the apache merger agreement the company granted performancebased restricted stock units to key members of apache management and employees with a maximum of 130 million to be earned over a threefiscalyear period beginning january 1 2012 vesting of the full award or a portion thereof is determined discretely for each of the three fiscal years based on the achievement of certain revenue and operating income targets by the apache subsidiary and the recipients continued employment through the measurement period the value of each restricted stock unit on the august 1 2011 grant date was 5030 the closing price of ansys stock as of that date total compensation expense associated with the awards recorded for the years ended december 31 2013  and 2012  was 38 million  and 39 million  respectively for the year ended december 31 2013  employees earned 75477  units which will be issued in the first quarter of 2014 

to the extent the company changes the terms of its stockbased compensation programs experiences market volatility in the pricing of its common stock that increases the implied volatility assumption used in the blackscholes model refines different assumptions in future periods such as forfeiture rates that differ from current estimates or assumes stock awards from acquired companies that are different in nature than the companys stock award arrangements among other potential impacts the stockbased compensation expense recorded in future periods and the related tax benefits may differ significantly from what was recorded in previous reporting periods 

estimates of stockbased compensation expense are significant to the company’s financial statements but this expense is based on the aforementioned option valuation models and will never result in the payment of cash by the company for this reason and because the company does not view stockbased compensation as related to its operational performance the board of directors and management exclude estimated stockbased compensation expense when evaluating the company’s underlying business performance

foreign currency transaction risk  as the company continues to expand its business presence in international regions the portion of its revenue expenses cash accounts receivable and payment obligations denominated in foreign currencies continues to increase as a result changes in currency exchange rates will affect the company’s financial position results of operations and cash flows the company is most impacted by movements in and among the euro british pound japanese yen indian rupee korean won and the us dollar 

with respect to revenue on average for the year ended december 31 2013  the us dollar was 40  stronger when measured against the company’s primary foreign currencies than for the year ended december 31 2012  the net overall strengthening primarily related to the japanese yen resulted in decreased revenue and operating income of 176 million  and 122 million  respectively during the year ended december 31 2013  as compared to the year ended december 31 2012  

the company has foreign currency denominated liabilities in order to provide a natural hedge to mitigate the foreign currency exchange risk the company will purchase foreign currencies and hold these currencies in cash until the liabilities are settled 

the most significant currency impacts on revenue and operating income are typically attributable to us dollar exchange rate changes against the british pound euro and japanese yen the exchange rates for these currencies are reflected in the charts below

competition 

the company believes that the principal factors affecting sales of its software include ease of use breadth and depth of functionality flexibility quality ease of integration with other software systems file compatibility across computer platforms range of supported computer platforms performance price and total cost of ownership customer service and support company reputation and financial viability and effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts 

the company continues to experience competition across all markets for its products and services some of the companys current and possible future competitors have greater financial technical marketing and other resources than the company and some have well established relationships with current and potential customers of the company the companys current and possible future competitors also include firms that have or may in the future elect to compete by means of open source licensing these competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes price reductions andor increased operating costs and could result in lower revenues margins and net income 

proprietary rights and licenses 

the company regards its software as proprietary and relies on a combination of trade secret copyright patent and trademark laws license agreements nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect its proprietary rights in its products the company distributes its software products under software license agreements that grant customers nonexclusive licenses which are typically nontransferable for the use of the companys products license agreements for the companys products are directly between the company and endusers use of the licensed software product is restricted to specified sites unless the customer obtains a multisite license for its use of the software product software security measures are also employed to prevent unauthorized use of the companys software products and the licensed software is subject to terms and conditions prohibiting unauthorized reproduction customers may purchase a perpetual license of the technology with the right to annually purchase ongoing maintenance technical support and upgrades or may lease the product on a fixedterm basis for a fee that includes the license maintenance technical support and upgrades 

the company licenses its software products utilizing a combination of webbased and hard copy license terms and forms for certain software products the company primarily relies on clickwrapped licenses the enforceability of these types of agreements under the laws of some jurisdictions is uncertain 

the company also seeks to protect the source code of its software as a trade secret and as unpublished copyrighted work the company has obtained federal trademark registration protection for ansys and other marks in the us and in foreign countries additionally the company was awarded numerous patents by the us patent and trademark office and has a number of patent applications pending the company does not always choose to seek patent protection for its intellectual property as the process of obtaining patent protection is expensive and time consuming as a result the company primarily relies on the protection of its source code as a trade secret 

employees of the company have signed agreements under which they have agreed not to disclose trade secrets or confidential information and where legally permitted that restrict engagement in or connection with any business that is competitive with the company anywhere in the world while employed by the company and in some cases for specified periods thereafter and that any products or technology created by them during their term of employment are the property of the company in addition the company requires all channel partners to enter into agreements not to disclose the companys trade secrets and other proprietary information 

despite these precautions there can be no assurance that misappropriation of the companys technology and proprietary information including source code will not occur further there can be no assurance that copyright trademark patent and trade secret protection will be available for the companys products in certain jurisdictions or that restrictions on the ability of employees and channel partners to engage in activities competitive with the company will be enforceable costly and timeconsuming litigation could be necessary in the future to enforce the companys rights to its trade secrets and proprietary information or to enforce its patent rights and copyrights and it is possible that in the future the companys competitors may be able to obtain the companys trade secrets or to independently develop unpatented technology similar to the companys 

the software development industry is characterized by rapid technological change therefore the company believes that factors such as the technological and creative skills of its personnel new product developments frequent product enhancements name recognition and reliable product maintenance are also important to establishing and maintaining technology leadership in addition to the various legal protections of its technology that may be available 

the company does not believe that any of its products infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties there can be no assurance however that third parties will not claim such infringement by the company or its licensors or licensees with respect to current or future products the company expects that software suppliers will increasingly be subject to the risk of such 

claims as the number of products and suppliers continues to expand and the functionality of products continues to increase any such claims with or without merit could be time consuming result in costly litigation cause product shipment delays or require the company to enter into royalty or licensing agreements such royalty or licensing agreements if required may not be available on terms acceptable to the company 

seasonal variations 

the companys business has experienced seasonality including quarterly reductions in software sales resulting from the slowdown during the summer months particularly in europe as well as from the seasonal purchasing and budgeting patterns of the companys global customers the companys revenue is typically highest in the fourth quarter 

backlog 

the company had a backlog of 552 million  and 563 million of orders received but not invoiced as of december 31 2012   and 2011  respectively 

employees 

as of december 31 2012  the company and its subsidiaries had approximately 2400  employees at that date there were also contract personnel and coop students providing ongoing development services and technical support certain employees of the company are subject to collective bargaining agreements and have local work councils the company believes that its relationship with its employees is good

risk factors 

tableend information provided by the company or its spokespersons including information contained in this annual report on form 10k may from time to time contain forwardlooking statements concerning projected financial performance market and industry sector growth product development and commercialization or other aspects of future operations such statements will be based on the assumptions and expectations of the companys management at the time such statements are made the company cautions investors that its performance and therefore any forwardlooking statement is subject to risks and uncertainties various important factors including but not limited to the following may cause the companys future results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statement 

global economic conditions   the financial markets in certain geographies continue to experience disruption including among other things volatility in securities prices diminished liquidity and credit availability ratings downgrades of certain investments declining valuations of others and uncertainty regarding governmental fiscal policies these economic conditions may negatively impact the company as some of its customers defer purchasing decisions thereby lengthening the companys sales cycles in addition certain of the companys customers budgets may be constrained and they may be unable to purchase the companys products at the same level the companys customers ability to pay for the companys products and services may also be impaired which may lead to an increase in the companys allowance for doubtful accounts and writeoffs of accounts receivable the company is unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the current economic conditions should these economic conditions result in the company not meeting its revenue growth objectives the companys operating results cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 

decline in customers business   the companys sales are based significantly on enduser demand for products in key industrial sectors many of these sectors periodically experience economic declines which may be exacerbated by other economic factors including the recent global economic conditions these factors may adversely affect the companys business by extending sales cycles and reducing revenue these economic factors may cause the companys customers to reduce the 

size of their workforce or cut back on operations and may lead to a reduction in license renewals or ongoing maintenance contracts with the company the companys customers may also request discounts or extended payment terms on new products or seek to extend payment terms on existing contracts all of which may cause fluctuations in the companys future operating results the company may not be able to adjust its operating expenses to offset such fluctuations because a substantial portion of the companys operating expenses is related to personnel facilities and marketing programs the level of personnel and related expenses may not be able to be adjusted quickly and is based in significant part on the companys expectation for future revenue 

risks associated with international activities  a majority of the companys business comes from outside the united states and the company has customers that supply a wide spectrum of goods and services in virtually all of the worlds major economic regions as the company continues to expand its sales presence in international regions the portion of its revenue expenses cash accounts receivable and payment obligations denominated in foreign currencies continues to increase the companys revenues and operating results are adversely affected when the us dollar strengthens relative to other currencies and are positively affected when the us dollar weakens as a result changes in currency exchange rates will affect the companys financial position results of operations and cash flows in the event that there are economic declines in countries in which the company conducts transactions the resulting changes in currency exchange rates may affect the companys financial position results of operations and cash flows the company is most impacted by movements in and among the euro british pound japanese yen indian rupee korean won and the us dollar   the company seeks to reduce these risks primarily through its normal operating and treasury activities but there can be no assurance that it will be successful in reducing these risks 

additional risks inherent in the companys international business activities include imposition of government controls export license requirements restrictions on the export of critical technology products and services political and economic instability trade restrictions changes in tariffs and taxes difficulties in staffing and managing international operations longer accounts receivable payment cycles and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations effective patent copyright trademark and trade secret protection may not be available in every foreign country in which the company sells its products and services the companys business financial position results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks 

stock market and stock price volatility  market prices for securities of software companies have generally been volatile in particular the market price of the companys common stock has been and may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations as a result of factors affecting the company the software industry or the securities markets in general such factors include but are not limited to declines in trading price that may be triggered by the companys failure to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors moreover the trading price could be subject to additional fluctuations in response to quartertoquarter variations in the companys operating results material announcements made by the company or its competitors conditions in the financial markets or the software industry generally or other events and factors many of which are beyond the companys control 

rapidly changing technology new products risk of product defects the company operates in an industry generally characterized by rapidly changing technology and frequent new product introductions which can render existing products obsolete or unmarketable a major factor in the companys future success will be its ability to anticipate technological changes and to develop and introduce in a timely manner enhancements to its existing products products acquired in acquisitions and new products to meet those changes if the company is unable to introduce new products and to respond quickly to industry changes its business financial position results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

the introduction and marketing of new or enhanced products require the company to manage the transition from existing products in order to minimize disruption in customer purchasing patterns there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing and marketing on a timely basis new products or product enhancements that its new products will adequately address the changing needs of the marketplace or that it will successfully manage the transition from existing products software products as complex as those offered by the company may contain undetected errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are released and the likelihood of errors is increased as a result of the companys commitment to the frequency of its product releases there can be no assurance that errors will not be found in any new or enhanced products after commencement of commercial shipments certain products require a higher level of sales and support expertise the ability of the companys sales channel particularly the indirect channel to obtain this expertise and to sell the new product offerings effectively could have an adverse impact on the companys sales in future periods any of these problems may result in the loss of or delay in customer acceptance diversion of development resources damage to the companys reputation or increased service and warranty costs any of which could have a material adverse effect on the companys business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

product quality the company has separate quality systems and registrations under the iso 90012008 standard in addition to other governmental and industrial regulations the company’s continued compliance with quality standards and favorable 

outcomes in periodic examinations is important to retain current customers and vital to procure new sales if the company was determined not to be compliant with various regulatory or iso 90019000 standards its certificates of registration could be suspended requiring remedial action and a timeconsuming reregistration process the company’s reputation may become diminished resulting in a material adverse impact on revenue operating margins net income financial position and cash flows 

competition  the company continues to experience competition across all markets for its products and services some of the companys current and possible future competitors have greater financial technical marketing and other resources than the company and some have well established relationships with current and potential customers of the company the companys current and possible future competitors also include firms that have or may in the future elect to compete by means of open source licensing these competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes price reductions andor increased operating costs and could result in lower revenues margins and net income 

changes in the companys pricing models the intense competition the company faces in the sales of its products and services and general economic and business conditions can put pressure on the company to adjust its prices if the companys competitors offer deep discounts on certain products or services or develop products that the marketplace considers more valuable the company may need to lower prices or offer other favorable terms in order to compete successfully any such changes may reduce operating margins and could adversely affect operating results the companys software license updates and product support fees are generally priced as a percentage of its new software license fees the companys competitors may offer lower percentage pricing on product updates and support that could put pressure on the company to further discount its new license prices 

any broadbased change to the companys prices and pricing policies could cause new software license and service revenues to decline or be delayed as its sales force implements and its customers adjust to the new pricing policies some of the companys competitors may bundle software products for promotional purposes or as a longterm pricing strategy or provide guarantees of prices and product implementations these practices could over time significantly constrain the prices that the company can charge for certain of its products if the company does not adapt its pricing models to reflect changes in customer use of its products or changes in customer demand the companys new software license revenues could decrease additionally increased distribution of applications through application service providers including softwareasaservice providers may reduce the average price for the companys products or adversely affect other sales of the companys products reducing new software license revenues unless the company can offset price reductions with volume increases the increase in open source software distribution may also cause the company to adjust its pricing models 

dependence on senior management and key technical personnel  the companys success depends upon the continued services of the companys senior executives key technical employees and other employees each of the companys executive officers key technical personnel and other employees could terminate his or her relationship with the company at any time the loss of any of the companys senior executives might significantly delay or prevent the achievement of the companys business objectives and could materially harm the companys business and customer relationships 

in addition because of the highly technical nature of the companys products the company must attract and retain highly skilled engineering and development personnel many of whom are recruited from outside of the united states the market for this talent is highly competitive the company is limited in its ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws if the company has less success in recruiting and retaining key personnel the companys business reputation and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 

dependence on proprietary technology  the companys success is highly dependent upon its proprietary technology the company generally relies on contracts and the laws of copyright patents trademarks and trade secrets to protect its technology the company maintains a trade secrets program enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees and channel partners and limits access to and distribution of its software documentation and other proprietary information there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company to protect its proprietary technology will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of its technology by third parties or that third parties will not be able to develop similar technology independently costly and timeconsuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of trade secret rights and related confidentiality and nondisclosure provisions although the company is not aware that any of its technology infringes upon the rights of third parties there can be no assurance that other parties will not assert technology infringement claims against the company or that if asserted such claims will not prevail 

risks associated with security of our products source code and it systems we make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our products source code and computer systems and data despite significant efforts to create security barriers to such programs it is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk there appears to be an increasing number of computer “hackers” developing and deploying a variety of destructive software programs such as viruses worms 

and the like that could attack our products and computer systems like all software products our software is vulnerable to such attacks the impact of such an attack could disrupt the proper functioning of our software products cause errors in the output of our customers work allow unauthorized access to sensitive proprietary or confidential information of ours or our customers and other destructive outcomes if this were to occur our reputation may suffer customers may stop buying our products we could face lawsuits and potential liability and our financial performance could be negatively impacted 

there is also a danger of industrial espionage cyberattacks misuse or theft of information or assets including source code or damage to assets by people who have gained unauthorized access to our facilities systems or information such cybersecurity breaches misuse or other disruptions could lead to the disclosure of portions of our product source code or other confidential information improper usage and distribution of our products without compensation illegal usage of our products jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through our computer systems theft manipulation and destruction of private and proprietary data defective products and production downtimes although we actively employ measures to combat unlicensed copying access and use of software and intellectual property through a variety of techniques preventing unauthorized use or infringement of our rights is inherently difficult these events could adversely affect our financial results or could result in significant claims for damages against us and participating in lawsuits to protect against any such unauthorized access to usage of or disclosure of any of our products or any portion of our product source code or in prosecutions in connection with any such cybersecurity breach could be costly and timeconsuming and may divert managements attention and adversely affect the markets perception of us and our products 

policing the unauthorized distribution and use of our products is difficult and software piracy including online piracy is a persistent problem although we actively employ measures to combat unlicensed copying access and use of software and intellectual property through a variety of techniques preventing unauthorized use or infringement of our rights is inherently difficult the proliferation of technology designed to circumvent typical software protection measures used in our products and the possibility that methods of circumventing the techniques we employ in our products may lead to an expansion in piracy or misuse of our products and intellectual property as a result and despite our efforts to prevent such activities and to prosecute instances of such activities we may nonetheless lose significant revenue due to illegal use of our software and managements attention may be diverted to address specific instances of piracy or misuse or address piracy and misuse in general 

a number of our core processes such as software development sales and marketing customer service and financial transactions rely on our it infrastructure and applications malicious software sabotage and other cybersecurity breaches of the types discussed above could cause an outage of our infrastructure which could lead to a substantial denial of service and ultimately to production downtime recovery costs and customer claims this could have a significant negative impact on our business financial position profit or cash flows 

we have implemented a number of measures designed to ensure the security of our information it resources and other assets nonetheless unauthorized users could gain access to our systems through cyberattacks and steal use without authorization and sabotage our intellectual property and confidential data any breach of our it security misuse or theft could lead to loss of production to recovery costs or to litigation brought by employees customers or business partners which could have a significant negative impact on our business financial position profit cash flows and reputation 

dependence on channel partners  the company continues to distribute a meaningful portion of its products through its global network of independent regional channel partners the channel partners sell the companys software products to new and existing customers expand installations within the existing customer base offer consulting services and provide the first line of technical support consequently in certain geographies the company is highly dependent upon the efforts of the channel partners difficulties in ongoing relationships with channel partners such as failure to meet performance criteria or to promote the companys products as aggressively as the company expects and differences in the handling of customer relationships could adversely affect the companys performance additionally the loss of any major channel partner for any reason including a channel partners decision to sell competing products rather than the companys products could have a material adverse effect on the company moreover the companys future success will depend substantially on the ability and willingness of its channel partners to continue to dedicate the resources necessary to promote the companys portfolio of products and to support a larger installed base of the companys products if the channel partners are unable or unwilling to do so the company may be unable to sustain revenue growth 

during times of significant fluctuations in world currencies certain channel partners may have solvency issues to the extent that effective hedge transactions are not employed or there is not sufficient working capital in particular if the us dollar strengthens relative to other currencies certain channel partners who pay the company in us dollars may have trouble paying the company on time or may have trouble distributing the companys products due to the impact of the currency exchange fluctuation on such channel partners cash flows this may impact the companys ability to distribute its products into certain regions and markets and may have an adverse effect on the companys results of operations and cash flows 

reliance on perpetual licenses  although the company has historically maintained stable recurring revenue from the sale of software lease licenses and software maintenance subscriptions it also has relied on sales of perpetual licenses that involve payment of a single upfront fee and that are more typical in the computer software industry while revenue generated from software lease licenses and software maintenance subscriptions currently represents a portion of the companys revenue to the extent that perpetual license revenue continues to represent a significant percentage of total revenue the companys revenue in any period will depend increasingly on sales completed during that period 

renewal rates for annual lease and maintenance contracts a substantial portion of the companys license and maintenance revenue is derived from annual lease and maintenance contracts these contracts are generally renewed on an annual basis and typically have a high rate of customer renewal in addition to the recurring revenue base associated with these contracts a majority of customers purchasing new perpetual licenses also purchase related annual maintenance contracts if the rate of renewal for these contracts is adversely affected by economic or other factors the companys license and maintenance growth will be adversely affected over the term that the revenue for those contracts would have otherwise been recognized as a result the companys business financial position results of operations and cash flows may also be adversely impacted during those periods 

risks associated with acquisitions  historically the company has consummated acquisitions in order to support the companys longterm strategic direction accelerate innovation provide increased capabilities to its existing products supply new products and services expand its customer base and enhance its distribution channels in the future the company may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or if suitable candidates are identified the company may not be able to complete the business combination on commercially acceptable terms the process of exploring and pursuing acquisition opportunities may result in devotion of significant management and financial resources 

even if the company is able to consummate acquisitions that it believes will be successful such transactions present many risks significant risks to such acquisitions include among others failing to achieve anticipated synergies and revenue increases difficulty incorporating and integrating the acquired technologies or products with the companys existing product lines difficulty in coordinating establishing or expanding sales distribution and marketing functions as necessary disruption of the companys ongoing business and diversion of managements attention to transition or integration issues unanticipated and unknown liabilities the loss of key employees customers partners and channel partners of the company or of the acquired company and difficulties implementing and maintaining sufficient controls policies and procedures over the systems products and processes of the acquired company if the company does not achieve the anticipated benefits of its acquisitions as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by the companys management and financial or industry analysts or if others do not perceive the same benefits of the acquisition as the company there could be a material adverse effect on the companys stock price business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in addition for companies acquired limited experience will exist for several quarters following the acquisition relating to how the acquired companys sales pipelines will convert into sales or revenues and the conversion rate postacquisition may be quite different than the historical conversion rate because a substantial portion of the companys sales are completed in the latter part of a quarter and its cost structure is largely fixed in the shortterm revenue shortfalls may have a negative impact on the companys profitability a delay in a small number of large new software license transactions could cause the companys quarterly software license revenues to fall significantly short of its predictions 

risks associated with the esterel acquisition  on august 1 2012 the company completed its acquisition of esterel a leading provider of embedded software simulation and automatic generation of certified code solutions for mission critical applications under the terms of the acquisition agreement ansys acquired 100 of esterel for a purchase price of 582 million  which included 131 million  in acquired cash the acquisition agreement also includes retention provisions for key members of esterels management and employees the company funded the transaction entirely with existing cash balances while the acquisition of esterel is expected to accelerate development and delivery of new and innovative products to the marketplace while lowering design and engineering costs for customers the company will need to meet significant challenges to realize the expected benefits and synergies of the acquisition these challenges include 

 13 

 the accomplishment of these postacquisition objectives will involve considerable risks including 

 the market price of the companys common stock may decline as a result of the acquisition for a number of reasons including 

 if the company does not succeed in addressing these challenges or any other problems encountered in connection with the acquisition its operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

disruption of operations or infrastructure failures  a significant portion of the companys software development personnel source code and computer equipment is located at operating facilities in the united states canada india japan and throughout europe the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unforeseen catastrophe at any of these facilities could cause interruptions in the companys operations services and product development activities additionally if the company experiences problems that impair its business infrastructure such as a computer virus telephone system failure or an intentional disruption of its information technology systems by a third party these interruptions could have a material adverse effect on the companys business financial position results of operations cash flows and the ability to meet financial reporting deadlines further because the companys sales are not generally linear during any quarterly period the potential adverse effects resulting from any of the events described above or any other disruption of the companys business could be accentuated if it occurs close to the end of a fiscal quarter 

sales forecasts   the company makes many operational and strategic decisions based upon short and longterm sales forecasts the companys sales personnel continually monitor the status of all proposals including the estimated closing date and the value of the sale in order to forecast quarterly sales these forecasts are subject to significant estimation and are impacted by many external factors including global economic conditions and the performance of the companys customers a variation in actual sales activity from that forecasted could cause the company to plan or to budget incorrectly and therefore could adversely affect the companys business financial position results of operations and cash flows the companys management team forecasts macroeconomic trends and developments and integrates them through longrange planning into budgets research and development strategies and a wide variety of general management duties global economic conditions and the effect those conditions and other disruptions in global markets have on the companys customers may have a significant impact on the accuracy of the companys sales forecasts these conditions may increase the likelihood or the magnitude of variations between actual sales activity and the companys sales forecasts and as a result the companys 

performance may be hindered because of a failure to properly match corporate strategy with economic conditions this in turn may adversely affect the companys business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

risks associated with significant sales to existing customers  a significant portion of the companys sales includes followon sales to existing customers that invest in the companys broad suite of engineering simulation software and services if a significant number of current customers were to become dissatisfied with the companys products and services or choose to license or utilize competitive offerings the companys followon sales and recurring lease and maintenance revenues could be materially adversely impacted resulting in reduced revenue operating margins net income and cash flows 

income tax estimates   the company makes significant estimates in determining its worldwide income tax provision these estimates involve complex tax regulations in a number of jurisdictions across the companys global operations and are subject to many transactions and calculations in which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain the final outcome of tax matters could be different than the estimates reflected in the historical income tax provision and related accruals such differences could have a material impact on income tax expense and net income in the periods in which such determinations are made 

the amount of income tax paid by the company is subject to ongoing audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities these audits can often result in additional assessments including interest and penalties the companys estimate for liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions is highly judgmental and actual future outcomes may result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to the companys estimated tax liabilities including estimates for uncertain tax positions in the period the assessments are made or resolved audits are closed or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire as a result the companys effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly or annual basis 

the company allocates a portion of its purchase price to goodwill and intangible assets impairment charges associated with goodwill are generally not tax deductible and will result in an increased effective income tax rate in the period the impairment is recorded the company has recorded significant deferred tax liabilities related to acquired intangible assets that are not deductible for tax purposes these deferred tax liabilities are based on future statutory tax rates in the locations in which the intangible assets are recorded any future changes in statutory tax rates would be recorded as an adjustment to the deferred tax liabilities in the period the change is announced and could have a material impact on the companys effective tax rate during that period 

periodic reorganization of sales force  the company relies heavily on its direct sales force from time to time the company reorganizes and makes adjustments to its sales force in response to such factors as management changes performance issues market opportunities and other considerations these changes may result in a temporary lack of sales production and may adversely impact revenue in future quarters there can be no assurance that the company will not restructure its sales force in future periods or that the transition issues associated with such a restructuring will not occur 

regulatory compliance   like all other public companies the company is subject to the rules and regulations of the sec including those that require the company to report on and receive an attestation from its independent registered public accounting firm regarding the companys internal control over financial reporting compliance with these requirements causes the company to incur additional expenses and causes management to divert time from the daytoday operations of the company while the company anticipates being able to fully comply with these requirements if it is not able to comply with the sarbanesoxley reporting or attestation requirements relating to internal control over financial reporting the company may be subject to sanctions by the sec or nasdaq such sanctions could divert the attention of the companys management from implementing its business plan and could have an adverse effect on the companys business and results of operations 

as the companys stock is listed on the nasdaq global select market the company is subject to the ongoing financial and corporate governance requirements of nasdaq while the company anticipates being able to fully comply with these requirements if it is not able to comply the companys name may be published on nasdaqs daily noncompliant companies list until nasdaq determines that it has regained compliance or the company no longer trades on nasdaq if the company were unable to return to compliance with the governance requirements of nasdaq the company may be delisted from the nasdaq global select market which could have an adverse effect on the market value of the companys equity securities and the ability to raise additional capital 

governmental revenue sources the companys sales to the united states government must comply with federal acquisition regulations failure to comply with these regulations could result in penalties being assessed against the company or an order preventing the company from making future sales to the united states government further the companys international activities must comply with the export control laws of the united states the foreign corrupt practices act and a variety of other laws and regulations of the united states and other countries in which the company operates failure to comply with any of these laws and regulations could adversely affect the companys business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

in certain circumstances the united states government state and local governments and their respective agencies and certain foreign governments may have the right to terminate contractual arrangements at any time without cause the united states european union and certain other government contracts as well as the companys state and local level contracts are subject to the approval of appropriations or funding authorizations certain of these contracts permit the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions including but not limited to termination of contracts refund of a portion of fees received forfeiture of profits suspension of payments fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business any of which could have an adverse effect on the companys results of operations and cash flows 

contingencies   the company is subject to various investigations claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business including alleged infringement of intellectual property rights commercial disputes labor and employment matters tax audits and other matters each of these matters is subject to various uncertainties and it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could materially affect the companys results of operations cash flows or financial position 

changes in existing financial accounting standards changes in existing accounting rules or practices new accounting pronouncements or varying interpretations of current accounting pronouncements could have a significant adverse effect on the companys results of operations or the manner in which the company conducts its business 

changes in tax law the companys operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions a change in the tax law in the jurisdictions in which the company does business including an increase in tax rates or an adverse change in the treatment of an item of income or expense could result in a material increase in tax expense currently a substantial portion of the companys revenue is generated from customers located outside the united states and a substantial portion of assets are located outside the united states united states income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings for nonunited states subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries changes in existing taxation rules or practices new taxation rules or varying interpretations of current taxation practices could have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations or the manner in which the company conducts its business 

the company has significant operations in india there have been court rulings concerning certain indian tax laws that have been inconsistent with tax positions taken by the company and inconsistent with the advice provided to the company by its tax advisors 

an indian subsidiary of the company received a formal inquiry after a service tax audit the service tax issues raised in the company’s notice are very similar to the case ms microsoft corporation i p ltd vs commissions of service tax  currently being appealed to the delhi customs excise and service tax appellate tribunal cestat if the ruling is in favor of microsoft the company expects a similar outcome for its audit case if the ruling is unfavorable in the case of microsoft the company could incur tax charges and related liabilities including those related to the service tax audit case of 6 million  of the two  judicial members assigned to the microsoft appeal one  member has ruled in favor of microsoft and one  has ruled in favor of the commission a third deciding judge will be appointed for a final decision the company can provide no assurances as to the outcome of the microsoft appeal or to the impact of the microsoft appeal on the company’s audit case the company is uncertain as to when the service tax audit will be completed 

other court cases are pending in india that could have a material impact on the companys financial position results of operations or cash flows if the ultimate outcome of those cases is similarly inconsistent with tax positions taken by the company

nongaap measures 

management uses nongaap financial measures a to evaluate the company’s historical and prospective financial performance as well as its performance relative to its competitors b to set internal sales targets and spending budgets c to allocate resources d to measure operational profitability and the accuracy of forecasting e to assess financial discipline over operational expenditures and f as an important factor in determining variable compensation for management and its employees in addition many financial analysts that follow the company focus on and publish both historical results and future projections based on nongaap financial measures the company believes that it is in the best interest of its investors to provide this information to analysts so that they accurately report the nongaap financial information moreover investors have historically requested and the company has historically reported these nongaap financial measures as a means of providing consistent and comparable information with past reports of financial results 

while management believes that these nongaap financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors there are limitations associated with the use of these nongaap financial measures these nongaap financial measures are not prepared in accordance with gaap are not reported by all of the company’s competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of the company’s competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation the company compensates for these limitations by using these nongaap financial measures as supplements to gaap financial measures and by reviewing the reconciliations of the nongaap financial measures to their most comparable gaap financial measures 

the adjustments to these nongaap financial measures and the basis for such adjustments are outlined below 

acquisition accounting for deferred revenue and its related tax impact  historically the company has consummated acquisitions in order to support its strategic and other business objectives in accordance with the fair value provisions applicable to the accounting for business combinations acquired deferred revenue is often recorded on the opening balance sheet at an amount that is lower than the historical carrying value although this purchase accounting requirement has no impact on the company’s business or cash flow it adversely impacts the company’s reported gaap revenue in the reporting periods following an acquisition in order to provide investors with financial information that facilitates comparison of both historical and future results the company provides nongaap financial measures which exclude the impact of the acquisition accounting adjustment the company believes that this nongaap financial adjustment is useful to investors because it allows investors to a evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in its financial and operational decisionmaking and b compare past and future reports of financial results of the company as the revenue reduction related to acquired deferred revenue will not recur when related annual lease licenses and software maintenance contracts are renewed in future periods 

amortization of intangibles from acquisitions and its related tax impact  the company incurs amortization of intangibles included in its gaap presentation of amortization expense related to various acquisitions it has made in recent years management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating nongaap operating income nongaap operating profit margin nongaap net income and nongaap diluted earnings per share when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the company because these costs are fixed at the time of an acquisition are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition accordingly management does not consider these expenses for purposes of evaluating the performance of the company during the applicable time period after the acquisition and it excludes such expenses when making decisions to allocate resources the company believes that these nongaap financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to a evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in its financial and operational decisionmaking and b compare past reports of financial results of the company as the company has historically reported these nongaap financial measures 

stockbased compensation expense and its related tax impact  the company incurs expense related to stockbased compensation included in its gaap presentation of cost of software licenses cost of maintenance and service research and development expense and selling general and administrative expense although stockbased compensation is an expense of the company and viewed as a form of compensation management excludes these expenses for the purpose of calculating nongaap operating income nongaap operating profit margin nongaap net income and nongaap diluted earnings per share when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the company specifically the company excludes stockbased compensation during its annual budgeting process and its quarterly and annual assessments of the company’s and management’s performance the annual budgeting process is the primary mechanism whereby the company allocates resources to various initiatives and operational requirements additionally the annual review by the board of directors during which it compares the company’s historical business model and profitability to the planned business model and profitability for the forthcoming year excludes the impact of stockbased compensation in evaluating the performance of senior management and department managers charges related to stockbased compensation are excluded from expenditure and profitability results 

in fact the company records stockbased compensation expense into a standalone cost center for which no single operational manager is responsible or accountable in this way management is able to review on a periodtoperiod basis each manager’s performance and assess financial discipline over operational expenditures without the effect of stockbased compensation the company believes that these nongaap financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to a evaluate the company’s operating results and the effectiveness of the methodology used by management to review the company’s operating results and b review historical comparability in its financial reporting as well as comparability with competitors’ operating results 

transaction costs related to business combinations  the company incurs expenses for professional services rendered in connection with business combinations which are included in its gaap presentation of selling general and administrative expense these expenses are generally not taxdeductible management excludes these acquisitionrelated transaction costs for the purpose of calculating nongaap operating income nongaap operating profit margin nongaap net income and nongaap diluted earnings per share when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the company as it generally would not have otherwise incurred these expenses in the periods presented as a part of its continuing operations the company believes that these nongaap financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to a evaluate the company’s operating results and the effectiveness of the methodology used by management to review the company’s operating results and b review historical comparability in its financial reporting as well as comparability with competitors’ operating results 

nongaap financial measures are not in accordance with or an alternative for gaap the company’s nongaap financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable gaap financial measures and should be read only in conjunction with the company’s consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap 

the company has provided a reconciliation of the nongaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures as listed below 



liquidity and capital resources 

cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments  as of december 31 2012  the company had cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaling 5772 million  and working capital of 4360 million  as compared to cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 4724 million  and working capital of 3013 million  at december 31 2011  

cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of highly liquid investments such as money market mutual funds and deposits held at major banks shortterm investments consist primarily of deposits held by certain foreign subsidiaries of the company with original maturities of three months to one year cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments include 1779 million  held by the company’s foreign subsidiaries as of december 31 2012  if these foreign balances were repatriated to the us they would be subject to domestic tax resulting in a tax obligation in the period of repatriation the amount of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments held by these subsidiaries is subject to translation adjustments caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period the offset to which is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income on the company’s consolidated balance sheet 

cash flows from operating activities  the company’s operating activities provided cash of 2984 million  in 2012  3077 million  in 2011  and 1669 million  in 2010  the net 92 million   decrease  in operating cash flows for the year ended december 31 2012  as compared to the year ended december 31 2011  was primarily related to 

 included in the 89 million  net cash inflow in 2012 was a reduction of 93 million  in the amount of income tax payments that otherwise would have been made in 2012 as a result of the tax impact associated with the merger of the companys japan subsidiaries as compared to a reduction of 180 million in 2011 please see below for a complete discussion of the expected future cash flow benefits associated with the merger of the companys japan subsidiaries 

 the net 1408 million   increase  in the companys cash flow from operating activities in 2011  as compared to 2010  was primarily the result of a 799 million   increase  in cash flows from operating assets and liabilities a 333 million   increase  in other noncash operating adjustments and a 275 million   increase  in net income the 2010 operating cash flows were adversely impacted by increased tax payments of 551 million related to the merger of the companys japan subsidiaries 

cash flows from investing activities  the company’s investing activities used net cash of 690 million  and 2916 million  for the years ended december 31 2012  and december 31 2011  respectively the company had net acquisitionrelated cash outlays of 451 million  and 2695 million  during the years ended december 31 2012  and december 31 2011  respectively total capital spending was 240 million  and 221 million  for the years ended december 31 2012  and 2011  respectively in may 2012 the company acquired an office building adjacent to its canonsburg headquarters for 48 million this building will serve primarily as a data center and customer training space and will provide flexibility for future expansion and the growing employee population the company currently plans capital spending of 35 million  to 45 million  during fiscal year 2013 including spending on the companys new headquarters facilities that are expected to be completed in 2014 the company has occupied its current headquarters facility since 1997 the overall level of capital spending in 2013 will be dependent upon various factors including growth of the business and general economic conditions 

the companys investing activities used net cash of 2916 million  and 66 million  in 2011  and 2010  respectively the change in cash used was primarily driven by the 2695 million  net cash outlay for the acquisition of apache in august 2011 

cash flows used in financing activities  financing activities used cash of 1248 million  and 97 million  for the years ended december 31 2012  and 2011  respectively this change of 1152 million  was primarily the result of an increase in cash used for treasury stock repurchases of 828 million  and a 425 million  increase in required principal payments on longterm debt in 2012  as compared to 2011  

financing activities used cash of 97 million  and 296 million  in 2011  and 2010  respectively this change of 200 million  was primarily driven by a 337 million  decrease in principal payments on longterm debt partially offset by 127 million  in treasury stock repurchases in 2011  there were no treasury stock repurchases in 2010 

the company’s term loan includes covenants related to the consolidated leverage ratio and the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio as well as certain restrictions on additional investments and indebtedness as of december 31 2012  the company is in compliance with all financial covenants as stated in the credit agreement the companys term loan matures on july 31 2013 

the company believes that existing cash and cash equivalent balances of 5767 million  together with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet the company’s working capital capital expenditure and debt service requirements through the next twelve months the company’s cash requirements in the future may also be financed through additional equity or debt financings there can be no assurance that such financings can be obtained on favorable terms if at all 

as of december 31 2012  15 million  shares remain authorized for repurchase under the company’s stock repurchase program 

the company continues to generate positive cash flows from operating activities and believes that the best use of its excess cash is to repay its longterm debt to invest in the business and under certain favorable conditions to repurchase stock additionally the company has in the past and expects in the future to acquire or make investments in complementary companies products services and technologies any future acquisitions may be funded by available cash and investments cash generated from operations existing or additional credit facilities or from the issuance of additional securities 

on august 1 2012 the company completed its acquisition of esterel a leading provider of embedded software simulation and automatic generation of certified code solutions for mission critical applications under the terms of the acquisition agreement ansys acquired 100  of esterel for a purchase price of 582 million  which included 131 million  in acquired cash the acquisition agreement also includes retention provisions for key members of esterels management and employees the company funded the transaction entirely with existing cash balances 

the companys operating cash flow has been favorably impacted by the 2010 merger of the companys japan subsidiaries the company saw a reduction in these cash flow savings of 168 million for the year ended december 31 2012  when compared to the year ended december 31 2011  this merger is expected to favorably impact the company’s cash flow from operations in future periods as follows 



with respect to the amounts in the preceding table whereby the timing is listed as “uncertain” the realization of these benefits is affected by the resolution of an audit of the company’s amended tax return refund claims which the internal revenue service “irs” began in the second quarter of 2012 the company continues to expect that it will realize these cash flow benefits 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

the company does not have any special purpose entities or offbalance sheet financing

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the company believes that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 

revenue is derived principally from the licensing of computer software products and from related maintenance contracts revenue from perpetual licenses is classified as license revenue and is recognized upon delivery of the licensed product and the utility that enables the customer to access authorization keys provided that acceptance has occurred and a signed contractual obligation has been received the price is fixed and determinable and collectibility of the receivable is probable the company determines the fair value of postcontract customer support “pcs” sold together with perpetual licenses based on the rate charged for pcs when sold separately revenue from pcs contracts is classified as maintenance and service revenue and is recognized ratably over the term of the contract 

revenue for software lease licenses is classified as license revenue and is recognized over the period of the lease contract typically the company’s software leases include pcs which due to the short term principally one year or less of the company’s software lease licenses cannot be separated from lease revenue for accounting purposes as a result both the lease license and pcs are recognized ratably over the lease period due to the shortterm nature of the software lease licenses and the frequency with which the company provides major product upgrades typically every 12–18 months the company does not believe that a significant portion of the fee paid under the arrangement is attributable to the pcs component of the arrangement and as a result includes the revenue for the entire arrangement within software license revenue in the consolidated statements of income 

the companys apache products are typically licensed via longer term leases of 24–36 months the company recognizes revenue for these licenses over the term of the lease contract because the company does not have vendorspecific objective evidence of the fair value of these leases the company also recognizes revenue from perpetual licenses over the term of the lease contract during the infrequent occurrence of these licenses being sold with apache leases in multipleelement arrangements 

revenue from training support and other services is recognized as the services are performed the company applies the specific performance method to contracts in which the service consists of a single act such as providing a training class to a customer and the proportional performance method to other service contracts that are longer in duration and often include multiple acts for example both training and consulting in applying the proportional performance method the company typically utilizes outputbased estimates for services with contractual billing arrangements that are not based on time and materials and estimates output based on the total tasks completed as compared to the total tasks required for each work contract inputbased estimates are utilized for services that involve general consultations with contractual billing arrangements based on time and materials utilizing direct labor as the input measure 

the company also executes arrangements through independent channel partners in which the channel partners are authorized to market and distribute the company’s software products to endusers of the company’s products and services in specified territories in sales facilitated by channel partners the channel partner bears the risk of collection from the enduser customer the company recognizes revenue from transactions with channel partners when the channel partner submits a written purchase commitment collectibility from the channel partner is probable a signed license agreement is received from the enduser customer and delivery has occurred provided that all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied revenue from channel partner transactions is the amount remitted to the company by the channel partners this amount includes a fee for pcs that is compensation for providing technical enhancements and the second level of technical support to the enduser which is based on the rate charged for pcs when sold separately and is recognized over the period that pcs is to be provided the company does not offer right of return product rotation or price protection to any of its channel partners 

nonincome related taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as accounts receivable and accrued expenses the collection and payment of these amounts are reported on a net basis in the consolidated statements of income and do not impact reported revenues or expenses 

the company warrants to its customers that its software will substantially perform as specified in the company’s most current user manuals the company has not experienced significant claims related to software warranties beyond the scope of maintenance support which the company is already obligated to provide and consequently the company has not established reserves for warranty obligations 

the company’s agreements with its customers generally require it to indemnify the customer against claims that the company’s software infringes thirdparty patent copyright trademark or other proprietary rights such indemnification obligations are generally limited in a variety of industrystandard respects including the company’s right to replace an infringing product as of december 31 2012  the company had not experienced any losses related to these indemnification obligations and no claims with respect thereto were outstanding the company does not expect significant claims related to these indemnification obligations and consequently the company has not established any related reserves 

the company makes judgments as to its ability to collect outstanding receivables and provides allowances for a portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices from both value and delinquency perspectives for those invoices not specifically reviewed provisions are provided at differing rates based upon the age of the receivable and the geographic area of origin in determining these percentages the company considers its historical collection experience and current economic trends in the customer’s industry and geographic region if the historical data used to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and future results of operations could be materially affected 

the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period of the enactment date 

the company records net deferred tax assets to the extent it believes these assets will more likely than not be realized in making such determination the company considers all available positive and negative evidence including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and recent financial operations in the event the company determines that it will be able to realize deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be recorded that would reduce the provision for income taxes 

tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a more likely than not threshold otherwise these tax benefits are recorded when a tax position has been effectively settled which means that the statute of limitations has expired or the appropriate taxing authority has completed their examination even though the statute of limitations remains open the company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the income tax expense line in the consolidated statements of income accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheets 

the company tests goodwill for impairment at least annually by performing a qualitative assessment of whether there is sufficient evidence that it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount the application of a qualitative assessment requires the company to assess and make judgments regarding a variety of factors which potentially impact the fair value of a reporting unit including general economic conditions industry and marketspecific conditions customer behavior cost factors the company’s financial performance and trends the company’s strategies and business plans capital requirements management and personnel issues and the company’s stock price among others the company then considers the totality of these and other factors placing more weight on the events and circumstances that are judged to most affect a reporting units fair value or the carrying amount of its net assets to reach a qualitative conclusion regarding whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 

if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the reporting units fair value is less than its carrying amount then the fair value of the reporting unit is estimated and an impairment loss is measured if any fair value is estimated using discounted cash flow and other valuation methodologies in preparing the estimate of fair value the company relies on a number of factors including historical operating results business plans anticipated future cash flows economic projections and other market data because there are inherent uncertainties involved in these factors the company’s estimates of fair value are imprecise and the resulting carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets may be misstated 

the company tests indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment at least annually by comparing the estimated fair value of each asset to its carrying value fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow valuation methodology in preparing the estimate of fair value the company relies on a number of factors including historical operating results business plans anticipated future cash flows economic projections and other market data because there are inherent uncertainties involved in these factors the companys estimates of fair value are imprecise and the resulting carrying value of indefinitelived intangible assets may be misstated when the company assigns fair value to a trademark it also estimates whether it has a finite or indefinite life thus impacting whether the value is amortized or not events such as product and naming strategy changes can occur whereby the company may reconsider the life whether finite or indefinite resulting in changes to amortization expense amortization periods may also be reconsidered for identifiable intangible assets with finite lives 

on january 1 2012  the company completed the annual impairment tests for goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets and determined that these assets had not been impaired as of the test date for goodwill the company performed a qualitative assessment and as of the test date there was sufficient evidence that it was more likely than not that the fair values of its two reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts due to the august 1 2012 acquisition of esterel the company now has three reporting units the fair value of the companys indefinitelived intangible assets substantially exceeded their carrying values as of the test date the key assumptions utilized in determining the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible assets are 

revenue growth rates growth rates of cash expenditures and related operating margin percentages income tax rates and factors that influence the companys weighted average cost of capital including interest rates the ratio of the companys debt capital to its total capital and the companys systematic risk or beta 

of the preceding factors fair value estimates are most sensitive to changes in revenue growth rate assumptions factors that could adversely affect the companys revenue growth rates include adverse economic conditions in certain geographies or industries especially key industrial and electronics industries enhanced competition and related pricing pressures integration issues associated with acquisitions strengthening of the us dollar or other adverse foreign currency fluctuations reduced renewal rates for the companys annual lease and maintenance contracts and the companys ability to attract and retain key personnel any of these factors individually or in combination could cause the companys growth rates to decline over a defined period of time the company has demonstrated an ability in the past to adjust its cost structure through reductions in discretionary spending delayed hiring or workforce reductions when faced with periods of reduced revenue growth if adverse conditions would persist over a longer period of time and would cause a revision to the companys longterm revenue growth rate projections without a similar cost reduction response or if other factors would occur that would result in a similar growth rate revision or a material revision to the other inputs to reporting unit fair value it could cause the fair value of the companys reporting unit to fall below its carrying value potentially resulting in an impairment 

the company is involved in various investigations claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business including alleged infringement of intellectual property rights commercial disputes labor and employment matters tax audits and other matters the company reviews the status of these matters assesses its financial exposure and records a related accrual if the potential loss from an investigation claim or legal proceeding is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable significant judgment is involved in the determination of probability and in the determination of whether an exposure is reasonably estimable as a result of the uncertainties involved in making these estimates the company may have to revise its estimates as facts and circumstances change the revision of these estimates could have a material impact on the company’s financial position and results of operations 

the company grants options and stock awards to employees and directors under the company’s stock option and grant plan eligible employees can also purchase shares of the company’s common stock at a discount under the company’s employee stock purchase plan the benefits provided under these plans are sharebased payments subject to the provisions of sharebased payment accounting guidance the company uses the fair value method to apply the provisions of sharebased payment accounting guidance sharebased compensation expense for 2012  2011  and 2010  was 324 million  231 million  and 190 million  respectively as of december 31 2012 total unrecognized estimated compensation expense related to unvested stock options granted prior to that date was 619 million  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 20 years 

the value of each sharebased award was estimated on the date of grant or date of acquisition for options issued in a business combination using the blackscholes option pricing model “blackscholes model” the determination of the fair value of sharebased payment awards using an option pricing model is affected by the company’s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables these variables include the company’s expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors riskfree interest rates and expected dividends the table below presents the weighted average input assumptions used and resulting fair values for options granted or issued in business combinations during each respective year the stockbased compensation expense for options is recorded ratably over their requisite service period the interest rates used were determined by using the fiveyear us treasury note yield on the date of grant or date of acquisition   



prior to 2012 the company issued both nonqualified and incentive stock options however the company no longer issues incentive stock options the tax benefits associated with the outstanding incentive stock options are unpredictable as they are predicated upon an award recipient triggering an event that disqualifies the award and that then results in a tax deduction to the company sharebased payment accounting guidance requires that these tax benefits be recorded at the time of the triggering event the triggering events for each option holder are not easily projected in order to estimate the tax benefits related to incentive stock options the company makes many assumptions and estimates including the number of incentive stock options that will be exercised during the period by us employees the number of incentive stock options that will be disqualified 

during the period and the fair market value of the company’s stock price on the exercise dates each of these items is subject to significant uncertainty additionally a significant portion of the tax benefits related to disqualified incentive stock options is accounted for as an increase to equity additional paidin capital rather than as a reduction in income tax expense although all such benefits continue to be realized through the company’s tax filings this accounting treatment has the effect of increasing tax expense and reducing net income for example the company realized a tax benefit of 76 million during the year ended december 31 2012 related to disqualified dispositions of incentive stock options however only 17 million of such amount was recorded as a reduction in income tax expense 

under the terms of the ansys inc longterm incentive plan in the first quarter of 2012 2011 and 2010 the company granted 100000 92500 and 80500 performancebased restricted stock units respectively vesting of the full award or a portion thereof is based on the company’s performance as measured by total shareholder return relative to the median percentage appreciation of the nasdaq composite index over a specified measurement period subject to each participant’s continued employment with the company through the conclusion of the measurement period the measurement period for the restricted stock units granted pursuant to the longterm incentive plan is a threeyear period beginning january 1 of the year of the grant each restricted stock unit relates to one share of the company’s common stock the estimated grantdate value of each restricted stock unit granted in 2012 2011 and 2010 was 3316 3205 and 2500 respectively the estimate of the grantdate value of the restricted stock units was made using a monte carlo simulation model the determination of the fair value of the awards was affected by the grant date and a number of variables each of which has been identified in the chart below sharebased compensation expense based on the fair value of the award is being recorded from the grant date through the conclusion of the threeyear measurement period on december 31 2012 employees earned 76500 restricted stock units which will be issued in the first quarter of 2013 



in addition the company grants deferred stock units to nonaffiliate independent directors which are rights to receive shares of common stock upon termination of service as a director the deferred stock units are issued in arrears and vest immediately as of december 31 2012 95227 deferred stock units have been earned with the underlying shares remaining unissued until the service termination of the respective director owners of this amount 28523 units were earned during the year ended december 31 2012 

in accordance with the apache merger agreement the company granted performancebased restricted stock units to key members of apache management and employees with a maximum of 130 million to be earned annually over a threefiscalyear period beginning january 1 2012 vesting of the full award or a portion thereof is determined discretely for each of the three fiscal years based on the achievement of certain revenue and operating income targets by the apache subsidiary and the recipients continued employment through the measurement period the value of each restricted stock unit on the august 1 2011 grant date was 5030 the closing price of ansys stock as of that date on december 31 2012 employees earned 76658 restricted stock units which will be issued in the first quarter of 2013 

if factors change and the company employs different assumptions in the application of sharebased payment accounting guidance in future periods the compensation expense that the company will record may differ significantly from what the company has recorded in the current period therefore it is important for investors to be aware of the high degree of subjectivity involved when using option pricing models to estimate sharebased compensation option pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions are fully transferable and do not cause dilution because the company’s sharebased payments have characteristics significantly different from those of freelytraded options and because changes in the input assumptions can materially affect the company’s estimates of fair values in the company’s opinion existing valuation models may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of the company’s sharebased compensation consequently there is a risk that the company’s estimates of the fair values of the company’s sharebased compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise expiration early termination or forfeiture of those sharebased payments in the future certain sharebased payments such as employee stock options may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in the company’s financial statements alternatively value may be realized from these instruments that is significantly in excess of the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and 

reported in the company’s financial statements there is currently no marketbased mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models nor is there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values although the fair value of employee sharebased awards is determined in accordance with sharebased payment accounting guidance using an option pricing model that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyerseller market transaction 

estimates of sharebased compensation expenses are significant to the company’s financial statements but these expenses are based on the aforementioned option valuation models and will never result in the payment of cash by the company for this reason and because the company does not view sharebased compensation as related to its operational performance the board of directors and management exclude estimated sharebased compensation expense when evaluating the company’s underlying business performance

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend interest income rate risk  changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest income that is generated from the company’s cash and shortterm investments for the year ended december 31 2012  total interest income was 34 million  cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of highly liquid investments such as money market mutual funds and deposits held at major banks 

interest expense rate risk  the company entered into a 3550 million term loan with variable interest rates as of july 31 2008 the term loan is scheduled to mature on july 31 2013 and provides for tiered pricing with the initial rate at the prime rate 050 or the libor rate 150 with step downs permitted after the initial six months under the credit agreement down to a flat prime rate or the libor rate 075 such tiered pricing is determined by the company’s consolidated leverage ratio the company’s consolidated leverage ratio has been reduced to the lowest pricing tier in the credit agreement the credit agreement includes quarterly financial covenants requiring the company to maintain certain financial ratios and as is customary for facilities of this type certain events of default that permit the acceleration of the loan borrowings outstanding under this facility totaled 531 million  as of december 31 2012  

the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement in order to hedge a portion of each of the first eight forecasted quarterly variable rate interest payments on the company’s term loan under the swap agreement the company received the variable threemonth libor rate required under its term loan and paid a fixed libor interest rate of 332 on the notional amount the initial notional amount of 3000 million was amortized equally at an amount of 375 million per quarter over eight quarters through june 30 2010 the interest rate swap agreement terminated on june 30 2010 

for the years ended december 31 2012  2011  and 2010  the company recorded interest expense related to the term loan at average interest rates of 122  105  and 153  respectively if the company did not enter into the interest rate swap agreement the weighted average interest rate would have been 108  for the year ended december 31 2010 the interest expense on the term loan and amortization related to debt financing costs were as follows 



based on the effective interest rates and remaining outstanding borrowings at december 31 2012  a 050 increase in interest rates would not impact the company’s interest expense for the quarter ending march 31 2013  based on the effective interest rates and remaining outstanding borrowings at december 31 2012  assuming contractual quarterly principal payments are made a 050 increase in interest rates would increase the company’s interest expense by 45000  for the seven months ending july 31 2013 also the maturity date of the term loan 

the interest rate on the outstanding term loan balance is set for the quarter ending march 31 2013  at 106  which is based on libor 075 as of december 31 2012  the fair value of the debt approximated the recorded value 

foreign currency transaction risk  as the company continues to expand its business presence in international regions the portion of its revenue expenses cash accounts receivable and payment obligations denominated in foreign currencies continues to increase as a result changes in currency exchange rates will affect the company’s financial position results of operations and cash flows the company is most impacted by movements in and among the euro british pound japanese yen indian rupee korean won and the us dollar 

the companys operating results are favorably impacted when the us dollar weakens against the companys primary foreign currencies and are adversely impacted when the us dollar strengthens against the companys primary foreign currencies with respect to revenue on average for the year ended december 31 2012  the us dollar was 37  stronger when measured against the company’s primary foreign currencies than for the year ended december 31 2011  the net overall strengthening resulted in decreased revenue and operating income of 154 million  and 74 million  respectively during the year ended december 31 2012  as compared to the year ended december 31 2011  

the company has foreign currency denominated intercompany payablesreceivables with certain foreign subsidiaries in order to provide a natural hedge the company will purchase foreign currencies and hold these currencies in cash until the intercompany payablesreceivables are settled these natural hedges mitigate a portion of the foreign currency exchange risk on the intercompany payablesreceivables 

in august 2012 the company entered into a foreign currency futures contract with a thirdparty us financial institution which will be settled in july 2013 the purpose of this contract is to mitigate the companys exposure to foreign exchange risk arising from intercompany receivables from a united kingdom subsidiary as of december 31 2012  the companys foreign exchange future is in a liability position of 240000  the foreign exchange future is measured at fair value each reporting period with gains or losses recognized in other expense in the companys consolidated statements of income 

the most significant currency impacts on revenue and operating income are typically attributable to us dollar exchange rate changes against the euro british pound and japanese yen the exchange rates for these currencies are reflected in the charts below

competition 

the company believes that the principal factors affecting sales of its software include ease of use breadth and depth of functionality flexibility quality ease of integration with other software systems file compatibility across computer platforms range of supported computer platforms performance price and total cost of ownership customer service and support company reputation and financial viability and effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts 

the company continues to experience competition across all markets for its products and services some of the company’s current and possible future competitors have greater financial technical marketing and other resources than the company and some have well established relationships with current and potential customers of the company the company’s current and possible future competitors also include firms that have or may in the future elect to compete by means of open source licensing these competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes price reductions andor increased operating costs and could result in lower revenues margins and net income 

proprietary rights and licenses 

the company regards its software as proprietary and relies on a combination of trade secret copyright patent and trademark laws license agreements nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect its proprietary rights in its products the company distributes its software products under software license agreements that grant customers nonexclusive licenses which are typically nontransferable for the use of the company’s products license agreements for the company’s products are directly between the company and end users use of the licensed software product is restricted to specified sites unless the customer obtains a multisite license for its use of the software product software security measures are also employed to prevent unauthorized use of the company’s software products and the licensed software is subject to terms and conditions prohibiting unauthorized reproduction customers may purchase a perpetual license of the technology with the right to annually purchase ongoing maintenance technical support and upgrades or may lease the product on a fixedterm basis for a fee that includes the license maintenance technical support and upgrades 

  

the company licenses its software products utilizing a combination of webbased and hard copy license terms and forms for certain software products the company primarily relies on “clickwrapped” licenses the enforceability of these types of agreements under the laws of some jurisdictions is uncertain 

the company also seeks to protect the source code of its software as a trade secret and as unpublished copyrighted work the company has obtained federal trademark registration protection for ansys and other marks in the us and in foreign countries additionally the company was awarded numerous patents by the us patent and trademark office and has a number of patent applications pending the company does not always choose to seek patent protection for its intellectual property as the process of obtaining patent protection is expensive and time consuming as a result the company relies on the protection of its source code as a trade secret 

employees of the company have signed agreements under which they have agreed not to disclose trade secrets or confidential information and where legally permitted that restrict engagement in or connection with any business that is competitive with the company anywhere in the world while employed by the company and in some cases for specified periods thereafter and that any products or technology created by them during their term of employment are the property of the company in addition the company requires all channel partners to enter into agreements not to disclose the company’s trade secrets and other proprietary information 

despite these precautions there can be no assurance that misappropriation of the company’s technology and proprietary information will not occur further there can be no assurance that copyright trademark patent and trade secret protection will be available for the company’s products in certain jurisdictions or that restrictions on the ability of employees and channel partners to engage in activities competitive with the company will be enforceable costly and timeconsuming litigation could be necessary in the future to enforce the company’s rights to its trade secrets and proprietary information or to enforce its patent rights and it is possible that in the future the company’s competitors may be able to obtain our trade secrets or to independently develop unpatented technology similar to ours 

the software development industry is characterized by rapid technological change therefore the company believes that factors such as the technological and creative skills of its personnel new product developments frequent product enhancements name recognition and reliable product maintenance are also important to establishing and maintaining technology leadership in addition to the various legal protections of its technology that may be available 

the company does not believe that any of its products infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties there can be no assurance however that third parties will not claim such infringement by the company or its licensors or licensees with respect to current or future products the company expects that software suppliers will increasingly be subject to the risk of such claims as the number of products and suppliers continues to expand and the functionality of products continues to increase any such claims with or without merit could be time consuming result in costly litigation cause product shipment delays or require the company to enter into royalty or licensing agreements such royalty or licensing agreements if required may not be available on terms acceptable to the company 

seasonal variations 

the company’s business has experienced seasonality including quarterly reductions in software sales resulting from the slowdown during the summer months particularly in europe as well as from the seasonal purchasing and budgeting patterns of the company’s global customers the company’s revenue is typically highest in the fourth quarter 

  

backlog 

as a result of the timing of the company’s invoicing with respect to its acceptance of an order and execution of a software license agreement the company has historically had an insignificant order backlog due to the august 1 2011 acquisition of apache which has different billing arrangements with customers than those historically used by the company there is a backlog of 563 million of orders received but not invoiced as of december 31 2011 

employees 

as of december 31 2011 the company and its subsidiaries had approximately 2100 fulltime employees at that date there were also contract personnel and coop students providing ongoing development services and technical support the company believes that its relationship with its employees is good

 item 1a risk factors tableend information provided by the company or its spokespersons including information contained in this annual report on form 10k may from time to time contain forwardlooking statements concerning projected financial performance market and industry sector growth product development and commercialization or other aspects of future operations such statements will be based on the assumptions and expectations of the company’s management at the time such statements are made the company cautions investors that its performance and therefore any forwardlooking statement is subject to risks and uncertainties various important factors including but not limited to the following may cause the company’s future results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statement 

volatility in the global economy and disruption in financial markets the financial markets in certain geographies continue to experience disruption including among other things volatility in securities prices diminished liquidity and credit availability rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others while currently these conditions have not impaired the company’s ability to access credit markets and finance operations there can be no assurance that there will not be continued instability in or renewed deterioration of financial markets and confidence in major economies the company is impacted by these economic developments both domestically and globally in that the current tightening of credit in certain financial markets adversely affects the ability of its customers and suppliers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations and could result in a decrease in orders for the company’s products and services these economic conditions may negatively impact the company as some of its customers defer purchasing decisions thereby lengthening the company’s sales cycles in addition certain of the company’s customers’ budgets may be constrained and they may be unable to purchase the company’s products at the same level the company’s customers’ ability to pay for the company’s products and services may also be impaired which may lead to an increase in the company’s allowance for doubtful accounts and writeoffs of accounts receivable the company is unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the current economic conditions should these economic conditions result in the company not meeting its revenue growth objectives the company’s operating results cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 

  

decline in customers’ business the company’s sales are based significantly on end user demand for products in key industrial sectors many of these sectors periodically experience economic declines which may be exacerbated by other economic factors including the recent global economic disruptions these factors may adversely affect the company’s business by extending sales cycles and reducing revenue these economic factors may cause the company’s customers to reduce the size of their workforce or cut back on operations and may lead to a reduction in license renewals or ongoing maintenance contracts with the company the company’s customers may also request discounts or extended payment terms on new products or seek to extend payment terms on existing contracts all of which may cause fluctuations in the company’s future operating results the company may not be able to adjust its operating expenses to offset such fluctuations because a substantial portion of the company’s operating expenses is related to personnel facilities and marketing programs the level of personnel and related expenses may not be able to be adjusted quickly and is based in significant part on the company’s expectation for future revenue 

risks associated with international activities a majority of the company’s business comes from outside the united states and the company has customers that supply a wide spectrum of goods and services in virtually all of the world’s major economic regions as the company continues to expand its sales presence in international regions the portion of its revenue expenses cash accounts receivable and payment obligations denominated in foreign currencies continues to increase the company’s revenues and operating results are adversely affected when the us dollar strengthens relative to other currencies and are positively affected when the us dollar weakens as a result changes in currency exchange rates will affect the company’s financial position results of operations and cash flows in the event that there are economic declines in countries in which the company conducts transactions the resulting changes in currency exchange rates may affect the company’s financial position results of operations and cash flows the company is most impacted by movements in and among the british pound euro japanese yen canadian dollar indian rupee swedish krona chinese renminbi korean won taiwan dollar and the us dollar the company seeks to reduce these risks primarily through its normal operating and treasury activities but there can be no assurance that it will be successful in reducing these risks 

additional risks inherent in the company’s international business activities include imposition of government controls export license requirements restrictions on the export of critical technology products and services political and economic instability trade restrictions changes in tariffs and taxes difficulties in staffing and managing international operations longer accounts receivable payment cycles and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations effective patent copyright trademark and trade secret protection may not be available in every foreign country in which the company sells its products and services the company’s business financial position results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks 

stock market and stock price volatility market prices for securities of software companies have generally been volatile in particular the market price of the company’s common stock has been and may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations as a result of factors affecting the company the software industry or the securities markets in general such factors include but are not limited to declines in trading price that may be triggered by the company’s failure to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors moreover the trading price could be subject to additional fluctuations in response to quartertoquarter variations in the company’s operating results material announcements made by the company or its competitors conditions in the financial markets or the software industry generally or other events and factors many of which are beyond the company’s control 

rapidly changing technology new products risk of product defects the company operates in an industry generally characterized by rapidly changing technology and frequent new product introductions which can render existing products obsolete or unmarketable a major factor in the company’s future success will be its ability to anticipate technological changes and to develop and introduce in a timely manner enhancements to its existing products products acquired in acquisitions and new products to meet those changes if the company is 

  

unable to introduce new products and to respond quickly to industry changes its business financial position results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

the introduction and marketing of new or enhanced products require the company to manage the transition from existing products in order to minimize disruption in customer purchasing patterns there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing and marketing on a timely basis new products or product enhancements that its new products will adequately address the changing needs of the marketplace or that it will successfully manage the transition from existing products software products as complex as those offered by the company may contain undetected errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are released and the likelihood of errors is increased as a result of the company’s commitment to the frequency of its product releases there can be no assurance that errors will not be found in any new or enhanced products after commencement of commercial shipments certain of these products require a higher level of sales and support expertise the ability of the company’s sales channel particularly the indirect channel to obtain this expertise and to sell the new product offerings effectively could have an adverse impact on the company’s sales in future periods any of these problems may result in the loss of or delay in customer acceptance diversion of development resources damage to the company’s reputation or increased service and warranty costs any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

competition the company continues to experience competition across all markets for its products and services some of the company’s current and possible future competitors have greater financial technical marketing and other resources than the company and some have well established relationships with current and potential customers of the company the company’s current and possible future competitors also include firms that have or may in the future elect to compete by means of open source licensing these competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes price reductions andor increased operating costs and could result in lower revenues margins and net income 

changes in the company’s pricing models the intense competition the company faces in the sales of its products and services and general economic and business conditions can put pressure on the company to adjust its prices if the company’s competitors offer deep discounts on certain products or services or develop products that the marketplace considers more valuable the company may need to lower prices or offer other favorable terms in order to compete successfully any such changes may reduce operating margins and could adversely affect operating results the company’s software license updates and product support fees are generally priced as a percentage of its net new software license fees the company’s competitors may offer lower percentage pricing on product updates and support that could put pressure on the company to further discount its new license prices 

any broadbased change to the company’s prices and pricing policies could cause new software license and service revenues to decline or be delayed as its sales force implements and its customers adjust to the new pricing policies some of the company’s competitors may bundle software products for promotional purposes or as a longterm pricing strategy or provide guarantees of prices and product implementations these practices could over time significantly constrain the prices that the company can charge for certain of its products if the company does not adapt its pricing models to reflect changes in customer use of its products or changes in customer demand the company’s new software license revenues could decrease additionally increased distribution of applications through application service providers including softwareasaservice providers may reduce the average price for the company’s products or adversely affect other sales of the company’s products reducing new software license revenues unless the company can offset price reductions with volume increases the increase in open source software distribution may also cause the company to adjust its pricing models 

dependence on senior management and key technical personnel the company’s success depends upon the continued services of the company’s senior executives key technical employees and other employees each of the company’s executive officers key technical personnel and other employees could terminate his or her 

  

relationship with the company at any time the loss of any of the company’s senior executives might significantly delay or prevent the achievement of the company’s business objectives and could materially harm the company’s business and customer relationships in addition because of the highly technical nature of the company’s products the loss of any significant number of existing engineering and development personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business and operating results 

dependence on proprietary technology the company’s success is highly dependent upon its proprietary technology the company generally relies on contracts and the laws of copyright patents trademarks and trade secrets to protect its technology the company maintains a trade secrets program enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees and channel partners and limits access to and distribution of its software documentation and other proprietary information there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company to protect its proprietary technology will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of its technology by third parties or that third parties will not be able to develop similar technology independently costly and timeconsuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our trade secret rights and related confidentiality and nondisclosure provisions although the company is not aware that any of its technology infringes upon the rights of third parties there can be no assurance that other parties will not assert technology infringement claims against the company or that if asserted such claims will not prevail 

dependence on channel partners the company continues to distribute a meaningful portion of its products through its global network of independent regional channel partners the channel partners sell the company’s software products to new and existing customers expand installations within the existing customer base offer consulting services and provide the first line of technical support consequently in certain geographies the company is highly dependent upon the efforts of the channel partners difficulties in ongoing relationships with channel partners such as failure to meet performance criteria or to promote the company’s products as aggressively as the company expects and differences in the handling of customer relationships could adversely affect the company’s performance additionally the loss of any major channel partner for any reason including a channel partner’s decision to sell competing products rather than the company’s products could have a material adverse effect on the company moreover the company’s future success will depend substantially on the ability and willingness of its channel partners to continue to dedicate the resources necessary to promote the company’s portfolio of products and to support a larger installed base of the company’s products if the channel partners are unable or unwilling to do so the company may be unable to sustain revenue growth 

during times of significant fluctuations in world currencies certain channel partners may have solvency issues to the extent that effective hedge transactions are not employed or there is not sufficient working capital in particular if the us dollar strengthens relative to other currencies certain channel partners who pay the company in us dollars may have trouble paying the company on time or may have trouble distributing the company’s products due to the impact of the currency exchange fluctuation on such channel partner’s cash flows this may impact the company’s ability to distribute its products into certain regions and markets and may have an adverse effect on the company’s results of operations and cash flows 

reliance on perpetual licenses although the company has historically maintained stable recurring revenue from the sale of software lease licenses and software maintenance subscriptions it also has relied on sales of perpetual licenses that involve payment of a single upfront fee and that are more typical in the computer software industry while revenue generated from software lease licenses and software maintenance subscriptions currently represents a portion of the company’s revenue to the extent that perpetual license revenue continues to represent a significant percentage of total revenue the company’s revenue in any period will depend increasingly on sales completed during that period 

risks associated with acquisitions historically the company has consummated acquisitions in order to support the company’s longterm strategic direction accelerate innovation provide increased capabilities to its existing products supply new products and services expand its customer base and enhance its distribution channels in the future the company may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or if suitable 

  

candidates are identified the company may not be able to complete the business combination on commercially acceptable terms the process of exploring and pursuing acquisition opportunities may result in devotion of significant management and financial resources 

even if the company is able to consummate acquisitions that it believes will be successful such transactions present many risks significant risks to such acquisitions include among others failing to achieve anticipated synergies and revenue increases difficulty incorporating and integrating the acquired technologies or products with the company’s existing product lines difficulty in coordinating establishing or expanding sales distribution and marketing functions as necessary disruption of the company’s ongoing business and diversion of management’s attention to transition or integration issues unanticipated and unknown liabilities the loss of key employees customers partners and channel partners of the company or of the acquired company and difficulties implementing and maintaining sufficient controls policies and procedures over the systems products and processes of the acquired company if the company does not achieve the anticipated benefits of its acquisitions as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by the company’s management and financial or industry analysts or if others do not perceive the same benefits of the acquisition as the company there could be a material adverse effect on the company’s stock price business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in addition for companies acquired limited experience will exist for several quarters following the acquisition relating to how the acquired company’s sales pipelines will convert into sales or revenues and the conversion rate postacquisition may be quite different than the historical conversion rate because a substantial portion of the company’s sales are completed in the latter part of a quarter and its cost structure is largely fixed in the short term revenue shortfalls may have a negative impact on the company’s profitability a delay in a small number of large new software license transactions could cause the company’s quarterly software license revenues to fall significantly short of its predictions 

risks associated with the apache acquisition on august 1 2011 the company completed its acquisition of apache design inc a leading simulation software provider for advanced lowpower solutions in the electronics industry under the terms of the merger agreement ansys acquired 100 of the outstanding shares of apache for a purchase price of 3140 million which included 319 million in acquired cash and shortterm investments on apache’s balance sheet 32 million in ansys replacement stock option awards issued to holders of partiallyvested apache stock options and 95 million in contingent consideration that is based on the retention of a key member of apache’s management while the acquisition of apache is expected to accelerate development and delivery of new and innovative products to the marketplace while lowering design and engineering costs for customers the company will need to meet significant challenges to realize the expected benefits and synergies of the acquisition these challenges include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

the accomplishment of these postacquisition objectives will involve considerable risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the market price of the company’s common stock may decline as a result of the acquisition for a number of reasons including 

 

  

  

 if the company does not succeed in addressing these challenges or any other problems encountered in connection with the acquisition its operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

the company continues to believe that the acquisition of apache will be accretive to nongaap earnings within the first year following the acquisition the company’s ability to realize this goal will depend on meeting many of the challenges outlined above in the event that apache is not accretive within the first year following the acquisition or to the extent anticipated by the company’s management and financial or industry analysts it may have an adverse effect on the company’s business financial position and reputation 

disruption of operations or infrastructure failures a significant portion of the company’s software development personnel source code and computer equipment is located at operating facilities in the united states canada india japan and throughout europe the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unforeseen catastrophe at any of these facilities could cause interruptions in the company’s operations services and product development activities additionally if the company experiences problems that impair its business infrastructure such as a computer virus telephone system failure or an intentional disruption of its information technology systems by a third party these interruptions could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial position results of operations cash flows and the ability to meet financial reporting timelines further because the company’s sales are not generally linear during any quarterly period the potential adverse effects resulting from any of the events described above or any other disruption of the company’s business could be accentuated if it occurs close to the end of a fiscal quarter 

sales forecasts the company makes many operational and strategic decisions based upon short and longterm sales forecasts the company’s sales personnel continually monitor the status of all proposals including the estimated closing date and the value of the sale in order to forecast quarterly sales these forecasts are subject to 

  

significant estimation and are impacted by many external factors including global economic conditions and the performance of the company’s customers a variation in actual sales activity from that forecasted could cause the company to plan or to budget incorrectly and therefore could adversely affect the company’s business financial position results of operations and cash flows the company’s management team forecasts macroeconomic trends and developments and integrates them through longrange planning into budgets research and development strategies and a wide variety of general management duties global economic conditions and the effect those conditions and other disruptions in global markets have on the company’s customers may have a significant impact on the accuracy of the company’s sales forecasts these conditions may increase the likelihood or the magnitude of variations between actual sales activity and the company’s sales forecasts and as a result the company’s performance may be hindered because of a failure to properly match corporate strategy with economic conditions this in turn may adversely affect the company’s business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

risks associated with significant sales to existing customers a significant portion of the company’s sales include followon sales to existing customers that invest in the company’s broad suite of engineering simulation software and services if a significant number of current customers were to become dissatisfied with the company’s products and services or choose to license or utilize competitive offerings the company’s followon sales and recurring lease and maintenance revenues could be materially adversely impacted resulting in reduced revenue operating margins net income and cash flows 

renewal rates for annual lease and maintenance contracts a substantial portion of the company’s license and maintenance revenue is derived from annual lease and maintenance contracts these contracts are generally renewed on an annual basis and typically have a high rate of customer renewal in addition to the recurring revenue base associated with these contracts a majority of customers purchasing new perpetual licenses also purchase related annual maintenance contracts if the rate of renewal for these contracts is adversely affected by economic or other factors the company’s license and maintenance growth will be adversely affected over the term that the revenue for those contracts would have otherwise been recognized as a result the company’s business financial position results of operations and cash flows may also be adversely impacted during those periods 

income tax estimates the company makes significant estimates in determining its worldwide income tax provision these estimates involve complex tax regulations in a number of jurisdictions across the company’s global operations and are subject to many transactions and calculations in which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain the final outcome of tax matters could be different than the estimates reflected in the historical income tax provision and related accruals such differences could have a material impact on income tax expense and net income in the periods in which such determinations are made 

the amount of income tax paid by the company is subject to ongoing audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities these audits can often result in additional assessments including interest and penalties the company’s estimate for liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions is highly judgmental and actual future outcomes may result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to the company’s estimated tax liabilities including estimates for uncertain tax positions in the period the assessments are made or resolved audits are closed or when statutes of limitations on potential assessments expire as a result the company’s effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly or annual basis 

the company allocates a portion of its purchase price to goodwill and intangible assets impairment charges associated with goodwill are generally not tax deductible and will result in an increased effective income tax rate in the period the impairment is recorded the company has recorded significant deferred tax liabilities related to acquired intangible assets that are not deductible for tax purposes these deferred tax liabilities are based on future statutory tax rates in the locations in which the intangible assets are recorded any future changes in statutory tax rates would be recorded as an adjustment to the deferred tax liabilities in the period the change is announced and could have a material impact on the company’s effective tax rate during that period 

  

periodic reorganization of sales force the company relies heavily on its direct sales force from time to time the company reorganizes and makes adjustments to its sales force in response to such factors as management changes performance issues market opportunities and other considerations these changes may result in a temporary lack of sales production and may adversely impact revenue in future quarters there can be no assurance that the company will not restructure its sales force in future periods or that the transition issues associated with such a restructuring will not occur 

regulatory compliance like all other public companies the company is subject to the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission “sec” including those that require the company to report on and receive an attestation from its independent registered public accounting firm regarding the company’s internal control over financial reporting compliance with these requirements causes the company to incur additional expenses and causes management to divert time from the daytoday operations of the company while the company anticipates being able to fully comply with these requirements if it is not able to comply with the sarbanesoxley reporting or attestation requirements relating to internal control over financial reporting the company may be subject to sanctions by the sec or nasdaq such sanctions could divert the attention of the company’s management from implementing its business plan and could have an adverse effect on the company’s business and results of operations 

as the company’s stock is listed on the nasdaq global select market the company is subject to the ongoing financial and corporate governance requirements of nasdaq while the company anticipates being able to fully comply with these requirements if it is not able to comply the company’s name may be published on nasdaq’s daily noncompliant companies list until nasdaq determines that it has regained compliance or the company no longer trades on nasdaq if the company were unable to return to compliance with the governance requirements of nasdaq the company may be delisted from the nasdaq global select market which could have an adverse effect on the market value of the company’s equity securities and the ability to raise additional capital 

governmental revenue sources the company’s sales to the united states government must comply with the regulations set forth in the federal acquisition regulations failure to comply with these regulations could result in penalties being assessed against the company or an order preventing the company from making future sales to the united states government further the company’s international activities must comply with the export control laws of the united states the foreign corrupt practices act and a variety of other laws and regulations of the united states and other countries in which the company operates failure to comply with any of these laws and regulations could adversely affect the company’s business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

in certain circumstances the united states government state and local governments and their respective agencies and certain foreign governments may have the right to terminate contractual arrangements at any time without cause the united states european union and certain other government contracts as well as the company’s state and local level contracts are subject to the approval of appropriations or funding authorizations certain of these contracts permit the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions including but not limited to termination of contracts refund of a portion of fees received forfeiture of profits suspension of payments fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business any of which could have an adverse effect on the company’s results of operations and cash flows 

contingencies the company is subject to various investigations claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business including alleged infringement of intellectual property rights commercial disputes labor and employment matters tax audits and other matters each of these matters is subject to various uncertainties and it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could materially affect the company’s results of operations cash flows or financial position 

  

changes in existing financial accounting standards changes in existing accounting rules or practices new accounting pronouncements or varying interpretations of current accounting pronouncements could have a significant adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or the manner in which the company conducts its business 

changes in tax law the company’s operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions a change in the tax law in the jurisdictions in which the company does business including an increase in tax rates or an adverse change in the treatment of an item of income or expense could result in a material increase in tax expense currently a substantial portion of the company’s revenue is generated from customers located outside the united states and a substantial portion of assets are located outside the united states united states income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings for nonunited states subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries changes in existing taxation rules or practices new taxation rules or varying interpretations of current taxation practices could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or the manner in which the company conducts its business 

the company has significant operations in india recently there have been court rulings concerning certain indian tax laws that have been inconsistent with tax positions taken by the company and inconsistent with the advice provided to the company by its tax advisors the impact of changes in tax law interpretation has been included in the company’s results of operations during the period of the resolution of the applicable court case other court cases are pending in india that could have a material impact on the company’s financial position results of operations or cash flows if the ultimate outcome of those cases is similarly inconsistent with tax positions taken by the company 

natural disaster in japan the company has significant operations in japan during the first quarter of 2011 japan experienced a catastrophic earthquake and tsunami while the company’s operating facilities in japan were unharmed this natural disaster has had an economic impact on the company’s customers in japan and on customers in other geographic regions who may rely on production or suppliers in japan as a result the predictability of the timing and amounts of the company’s sales to customers in japan or that are otherwise affected by the japan natural disaster has become less reliable than it was prior to the earthquake and tsunami these circumstances could cause the company’s business financial position results of operations and cash flows to be adversely impacted

acquisitions 

on august 1 2011 the company completed its acquisition of apache design inc a leading simulation software provider for advanced lowpower solutions in the electronics industry under the terms of the merger agreement ansys acquired 100 of the outstanding shares of apache for a purchase price of 3140 million which included 319 million in acquired cash and shortterm investments on apache’s balance sheet 32 million in ansys replacement stock option awards issued to holders of partiallyvested apache stock options and 95 million in contingent consideration that is based on the retention of a key member of apache’s management the agreement also includes 130 million of performance equity awards for key members of management and employees earned annually over a threefiscalyear period beginning january 1 2012 these awards will be accounted for outside of the business combination the company funded the transaction entirely with existing cash balances 

the operating results of apache have been included in the company’s consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition august 1 2011 the assets and liabilities of apache have been recorded based upon management’s estimates of their fair values as of the acquisition date the following tables summarize the fair value of consideration transferred and the preliminary fair values of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date 

  

fair value of consideration transferred 

 

 recognized amounts of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed 

 

 in valuing deferred revenue on the apache balance sheet as of the acquisition date the company applied the fair value provisions applicable to the accounting for business combinations although this acquisition accounting requirement had no impact on the company’s business or cash flow the company’s reported revenue under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states primarily for the first 12 months postacquisition will be less than what would otherwise have been reported by apache absent the acquisition acquired deferred revenue of 101 million was recorded on the opening balance sheet this amount was approximately 136 million lower than the historical carrying value the impact on reported revenue for the year ended december 31 2011 was 96 million primarily in lease license revenue the expected impact on reported revenue for the year ending december 31 2012 is 34 million 

  

results of operations 

for purposes of the following discussion and analysis the table below sets forth certain consolidated financial data for the years 2011 2010 and 2009 the operating results of apache have been included in the results of operations since the acquisition date of august 1 2011 

 

   

year ended december 31 2011 compared to year ended december 31 2010 

revenue 

 

 the company’s revenue increased 192 in 2011 as compared to 2010 including increases in license and maintenance revenue this strong growth was partially influenced by a modest improvement in the global economy as compared to the prior year including the effects of these economic improvements on yearend spending patterns in certain geographies benefits from the company’s continued investment in its global sales and marketing organization and 145 million in revenue related to the acquisition of apache for the period from the acquisition date august 1 2011 through december 31 2011 perpetual license revenue which is derived entirely from new sales during the period increased 249 as compared to the prior year the annual maintenance contracts that were sold with the new perpetual licenses along with the renewal of maintenance contracts sold with perpetual licenses in previous years contributed to maintenance revenue growth of 166 revenue from lease licenses increased 181 as compared to the prior year due to growth in sales of lease licenses and the addition of apacherelated lease license revenue of 140 million service revenue increased 72 as compared to the prior year

a substantial portion of the company’s license and maintenance revenue is derived from annual lease and maintenance contracts these contracts are generally renewed on an annual basis and typically have a high rate of customer renewal in addition to the recurring revenue base associated with these contracts a majority of customers purchasing new perpetual licenses also purchase related annual maintenance contracts as a result of the significant recurring revenue base the company’s license and maintenance revenue growth rate in any period does not necessarily correlate to the growth rate of new license and maintenance contracts sold during that period to the extent the rate of customer renewal for lease and maintenance contracts is high incremental lease contracts and maintenance contracts sold with new perpetual licenses will result in license and maintenance revenue growth conversely if the rate of renewal for these contracts is adversely affected by economic or other factors the company’s license and maintenance growth will be adversely affected over the term that the revenue for those contracts would have otherwise been recognized

nongaap results 

the company provides nongaap revenue nongaap operating income nongaap operating profit margin nongaap net income and nongaap diluted earnings per share as supplemental measures to generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” regarding the company’s operational performance these financial measures exclude the impact of certain items and therefore have not been calculated in accordance with gaap a detailed explanation and a reconciliation of each nongaap financial measure to its most comparable gaap financial measure are included below 

 

  

     note the 2011 gaap and nongaap net income and earnings per share data reflected above include approximately 48 million or 005 per share related to income tax expense associated with reductions to the japanese corporate tax rate beginning with the 2013 tax year this legislation enacted on november 30 2011 resulted in an additional 48 million in deferred tax expense due to the reduction in the value of certain net deferred tax assets of the company’s japanese subsidiaries

nongaap measures 

management uses nongaap financial measures a to evaluate the company’s historical and prospective financial performance as well as its performance relative to its competitors b to set internal sales targets and spending budgets c to allocate resources d to measure operational profitability and the accuracy of forecasting e to assess financial discipline over operational expenditures and f as an important factor in determining variable compensation for management and its employees in addition many financial analysts that follow the company focus on and publish both historical results and future projections based on nongaap financial measures the company believes that it is in the best interest of its investors to provide this information to analysts so that they accurately report the nongaap financial information moreover investors have historically requested and the company has historically reported these nongaap financial measures as a means of providing consistent and comparable information with past reports of financial results 

while management believes that these nongaap financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors there are limitations associated with the use of these nongaap financial measures these nongaap financial measures are not prepared in accordance with gaap are not reported by all of the company’s competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of the company’s competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation the company compensates for these limitations by using these nongaap financial measures as supplements to gaap financial measures and by reviewing the reconciliations of the nongaap financial measures to their most comparable gaap financial measures 

the adjustments to these nongaap financial measures and the basis for such adjustments are outlined below 

acquisition accounting for deferred revenue and its related tax impact historically the company has consummated acquisitions in order to support its strategic and other business objectives in accordance with the fair value provisions applicable to the accounting for business combinations acquired deferred revenue is often recorded on the opening balance sheet at an amount that is lower than the historical carrying value although this purchase accounting requirement has no impact on the company’s business or cash flow it adversely impacts the company’s reported gaap revenue in the reporting periods following an acquisition in order to provide investors with financial information that facilitates comparison of both historical and future results the company provides nongaap financial measures which exclude the impact of the acquisition accounting adjustment the company believes that this nongaap financial adjustment is useful to investors because it allows investors to a evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in its financial and operational decisionmaking and b compare past and future reports of financial results of the company as the revenue reduction related to acquired deferred revenue will not recur when related annual lease licenses and software maintenance contracts are renewed in future periods 

amortization of intangibles from acquisitions and its related tax impact the company incurs amortization of intangibles included in its gaap presentation of amortization expense related to various acquisitions it has made in recent years management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating nongaap operating income nongaap operating profit margin nongaap net income and nongaap diluted earnings per share when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the company because these costs are fixed at the time of an acquisition are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition accordingly management does not consider these expenses for purposes of evaluating the performance of the company during the applicable time period after the acquisition and it excludes such expenses when making decisions to allocate resources the company believes that these nongaap financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to a evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in its financial and operational decisionmaking and b compare past reports of financial results of the company as the company has historically reported these nongaap financial measures 

  

stockbased compensation expense and its related tax impact the company incurs expense related to stockbased compensation included in its gaap presentation of cost of software licenses cost of maintenance and service research and development expense and selling general and administrative expense although stockbased compensation is an expense of the company and viewed as a form of compensation management excludes these expenses for the purpose of calculating nongaap operating income nongaap operating profit margin nongaap net income and nongaap diluted earnings per share when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the company specifically the company excludes stockbased compensation during its annual budgeting process and its quarterly and annual assessments of the company’s and management’s performance the annual budgeting process is the primary mechanism whereby the company allocates resources to various initiatives and operational requirements additionally the annual review by the board of directors during which it compares the company’s historical business model and profitability to the planned business model and profitability for the forthcoming year excludes the impact of stockbased compensation in evaluating the performance of senior management and department managers charges related to stockbased compensation are excluded from expenditure and profitability results in fact the company records stockbased compensation expense into a standalone cost center for which no single operational manager is responsible or accountable in this way management is able to review on a periodtoperiod basis each manager’s performance and assess financial discipline over operational expenditures without the effect of stockbased compensation the company believes that these nongaap financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to a evaluate the company’s operating results and the effectiveness of the methodology used by management to review the company’s operating results and b review historical comparability in its financial reporting as well as comparability with competitors’ operating results 

transaction costs related to business combinations the company incurs expenses for professional services rendered in connection with business combinations which are included in its gaap presentation of selling general and administrative expense these expenses are generally not taxdeductible management excludes these acquisitionrelated transaction costs for the purpose of calculating nongaap operating income nongaap operating profit margin nongaap net income and nongaap diluted earnings per share when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the company as it generally would not have otherwise incurred these expenses in the periods presented as a part of its continuing operations the company believes that these nongaap financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to a evaluate the company’s operating results and the effectiveness of the methodology used by management to review the company’s operating results and b review historical comparability in its financial reporting as well as comparability with competitors’ operating results 

nongaap financial measures are not in accordance with or an alternative for generally accepted accounting principles in the united states the company’s nongaap financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable gaap financial measures and should be read only in conjunction with the company’s consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap 

the company has provided a reconciliation of the nongaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures as listed below

 included in the 504 million net cash inflow in 2011 discussed above was a reduction of approximately 180 million in the amount of income tax payments that otherwise would have been made in 2011 as a result of the tax impact associated with the merger of the company’s japan subsidiaries 

 

  

 the net 68 million decrease in the company’s cash flow from operating activities in 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily the result of a 489 million decrease in cash flows from operating assets and liabilities partially offset by a 367 million increase in net income and a 53 million increase in other noncash operating adjustments 

cash flows from investing activities the company’s investing activities used net cash of 2916 million for the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to 66 million for the year ended december 31 2010 the company had net acquisitionrelated cash outlays of approximately 2695 million during the year ended

the company’s investing activities used net cash of 66 million for the year ended december 31 2010 and 107 million for the year ended december 31 2009 total capital spending was 143 million in 2010 and 83 million in 2009 in 2010 maturing shortterm investments exceeded purchases by 76 million in 2009 purchases of shortterm investments exceeded maturities by 24 million 

cash flows from financing activities financing activities used cash of 97 million and 296 million for the fiscal years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively this change of 200 million was primarily the result of a 337 million decrease in principal payments on longterm debt in the 2011 period as compared to the 2010 period partially offset by 127 million spent in 2011 to repurchase 247443 shares of treasury stock pursuant to the company’s stock repurchase program at an average price of 5134 per share there were no repurchases of treasury stock in the 2010 period 

financing activities used cash of 296 million and 641 million for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively this change of 345 million was primarily a result of 399 million spent in 2009 to repurchase 21 million shares of treasury stock at an average price of 1928 per share the company did not repurchase any stock in 2010 also contributing to the change was an 117 million increase in principal payments on longterm debt in 2010 as compared to 2009 these changes were partially offset by additional proceeds of 76 million in 2010 from the exercise of stock options 

the company’s term loan includes covenants related to the consolidated leverage ratio and the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio as well as certain restrictions on additional investments and indebtedness as of december 31 2011 the company is in compliance with all financial covenants as stated in the credit agreement 

as of december 31 2011 11 million shares remain authorized for repurchase under the company’s stock repurchase program although the company has repurchased stock during the years ended december 31 2011 and 2009 it may or may not do so in future periods 

the company believes that existing cash and cash equivalent balances of 4718 million together with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet the company’s working capital capital expenditure and debt service requirements through the next twelve months the company’s cash requirements in the future may also be financed through additional equity or debt financings there can be no assurance that such financings can be obtained on favorable terms if at all 

the company continues to generate positive cash flows from operating activities and believes that the best use of its excess cash is to repay its longterm debt to invest in the business and under certain favorable conditions to repurchase stock additionally the company has in the past and expects in the future to acquire or make investments in complementary companies products services and technologies any future acquisitions may be funded by available cash and investments cash generated from operations existing or additional credit facilities or from the issuance of additional securities 

the company has a 31 million line of credit available on a purchase card 

on august 1 2011 the company completed its acquisition of apache design inc a leading simulation software provider for advanced lowpower solutions in the electronics industry under the terms of the merger agreement ansys acquired 100 of the outstanding shares of apache for a purchase price of 3140 million which included 319 million in acquired cash and shortterm investments on apache’s balance sheet 32 

  

million in ansys replacement stock option awards issued to holders of partiallyvested apache stock options and 95 million in contingent consideration that is based on the retention of a key member of apache’s management the agreement also included 130 million of performance equity awards for key members of management and employees earned annually over a threefiscalyear period beginning january 1 2012 the company funded the transaction entirely with existing cash balances 

in addition to the favorable impact on 2011 operating cash flows of approximately 180 million that is discussed above the merger of the company’s japan subsidiaries is expected to favorably impact the company’s cash flow from operations in future periods as follows 

 

 with respect to the amounts in the preceding table whereby the timing is listed as “uncertain” the company previously estimated that there would be 26 million of additional us cash flow benefits in 2011 the company continues to expect that it will realize these cash flow benefits however the timing of these cash flows is now reflected as uncertain because the realization of these benefits is affected by the resolution of any administrative reviews by the internal revenue service “irs” of the company’s amended tax return refund claims in the first quarter of 2011 the company filed an amended tax return for a different matter seeking a less significant benefit than the one sought related to the restructuring of its japanese subsidiaries the irs initiated an audit of this amended filing that will prevent the company from realizing the cash flow benefits of the amended filing until the audit is completed due to the size of the benefit included on the amended return associated with the restructuring of its japanese subsidiaries the company similarly expects that the irs will initiate an audit thus making the timing of the receipt of these refunds not predictable with certainty

the company does not have any special purpose entities or offbalance sheet financing 

  

contractual obligations 

the company’s significant contractual obligations as of december 31 2011 are summarized below 

 

  

        

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the company believes that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 

revenue is derived principally from the licensing of computer software products and from related maintenance contracts revenue from perpetual licenses is classified as license revenue and is recognized upon delivery of the licensed product and the utility that enables the customer to access authorization keys provided that acceptance has occurred and a signed contractual obligation has been received the price is fixed and determinable and collectibility of the receivable is probable the company determines the fair value of postcontract customer support “pcs” sold together with perpetual licenses based on the rate charged for pcs when sold separately revenue from pcs contracts is classified as maintenance and service revenue and is recognized ratably over the term of the contract 

revenue for software lease licenses is classified as license revenue and is recognized over the period of the lease contract typically the company’s software leases include pcs which due to the short term principally one year or less of the company’s software lease licenses cannot be separated from lease revenue for accounting purposes as a result both the lease license and pcs are recognized ratably over the lease period due to the shortterm nature of the software lease licenses and the frequency with which the company provides major product upgrades typically every 12–18 months the company does not believe that a significant portion of the fee paid under the arrangement is attributable to the pcs component of the arrangement and as a result includes the revenue for the entire arrangement within software license revenue in the consolidated statements of income 

revenue from training support and other services is recognized as the services are performed the company applies the specific performance method to contracts in which the service consists of a single act such as providing a training class to a customer and the proportional performance method to other service contracts that are longer in duration and often include multiple acts for example both training and consulting in applying the proportional performance method the company typically utilizes outputbased estimates for services with contractual billing arrangements that are not based on time and materials and estimates output based on the total tasks completed as compared to the total tasks required for each work contract inputbased estimates are utilized for services that involve general consultations with contractual billing arrangements based on time and materials utilizing direct labor as the input measure 

the company also executes arrangements through independent channel partners in which the channel partners are authorized to market and distribute the company’s software products to end users of the company’s products and services in specified territories in sales facilitated by channel partners the channel partner bears the risk of collection from the end user customer the company recognizes revenue from transactions with channel partners when the channel partner submits a written purchase commitment collectibility from the channel partner is probable a signed license agreement is received from the end user customer and delivery has occurred provided that all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied revenue from channel partner transactions is the amount remitted to the company by the channel partners this amount includes a fee for pcs that is compensation for providing technical enhancements and the second level of technical support to the end user which is based on the rate charged for pcs when sold separately and is recognized over the period that pcs is to be provided the company does not offer right of return product rotation or price protection to any of its channel partners 

nonincome related taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are recorded on the balance sheet as accounts receivable and accrued expenses the collection and payment of these amounts are reported on a net basis in the consolidated statements of income and do not impact reported revenues or expenses 

the company warrants to its customers that its software will substantially perform as specified in the company’s most current user manuals the company has not experienced significant claims related to software 

  

warranties beyond the scope of maintenance support which the company is already obligated to provide and consequently the company has not established reserves for warranty obligations 

the company’s agreements with its customers generally require it to indemnify the customer against claims that the company’s software infringes thirdparty patent copyright trademark or other proprietary rights such indemnification obligations are generally limited in a variety of industrystandard respects including the company’s right to replace an infringing product as of december 31 2011 the company had not experienced any losses related to these indemnification obligations and no claims with respect thereto were outstanding the company does not expect significant claims related to these indemnification obligations and consequently the company has not established any related reserves 

the company makes judgments as to its ability to collect outstanding receivables and provides allowances for a portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices from both value and delinquency perspectives for those invoices not specifically reviewed provisions are provided at differing rates based upon the age of the receivable and the geographic area of origin in determining these percentages the company considers its historical collection experience and current economic trends in the customer’s industry and geographic region if the historical data used to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and future results of operations could be materially affected 

the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period of the enactment date 

the company records net deferred tax assets to the extent it believes these assets will more likely than not be realized in making such determination the company considers all available positive and negative evidence including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and recent financial operations in the event the company determines that it will be able to realize deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be recorded that would reduce the provision for income taxes 

tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a more likely than not threshold otherwise these tax benefits are recorded when a tax position has been effectively settled which means that the statute of limitations has expired or the appropriate taxing authority has completed their examination even though the statute of limitations remains open the company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the income tax expense line in the accompanying consolidated statements of income accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheets 

the company tests goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment at least annually by comparing the fair value of each asset or in the case of goodwill the company’s reporting units to its carrying value fair value is estimated using discounted cash flow and other valuation methodologies in preparing the estimate of fair value the company relies on a number of factors including historical operating results business plans anticipated future cash flows economic projections and other market data because there are inherent uncertainties involved in these factors the company’s estimates of fair value are imprecise and the resulting carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets may be misstated when the company assigns a fair value to a trademark it also estimates whether it has a finite or indefinite life thus impacting whether the value is amortized or not events such as product and naming strategy changes can occur whereby the company may 

  

reconsider the life whether finite or indefinite resulting in changes to amortization expense amortization periods may also be reconsidered for identifiable intangible assets with finite lives 

on january 1 2011 the company completed the annual impairment test for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives and determined that these assets had not been impaired as of this date the fair value of the company’s reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying value prior to the august 1 2011 acquisition of apache the company had only one reporting unit the key assumptions utilized in determining the fair value of the company’s reporting units are revenue growth rates growth rates of cash expenditures and related operating margin percentages income tax rates and factors that influence the company’s weighted average cost of capital including interest rates the ratio of the company’s debt capital to its total capital and the company’s systematic risk or beta 

of the preceding factors the fair values of the company’s reporting units are most sensitive to changes in revenue growth rate estimates factors that could adversely affect the company’s revenue growth rates include adverse economic conditions in certain geographies or industries especially key industrial and electronics industries enhanced competition and related pricing pressures integration issues associated with acquisitions strengthening of the us dollar or other adverse foreign currency fluctuations reduced renewal rates for the company’s annual lease and maintenance contracts and the company’s ability to attract and retain key personnel any of these factors individually or in combination could cause the company’s growth rates to decline over a defined period of time the company has demonstrated an ability in the past to adjust its cost structure through reductions in discretionary spending delayed hiring or workforce reductions when faced with periods of reduced revenue growth if adverse conditions would persist over a longer period of time and would cause a revision to the company’s longterm revenue growth rate projections without a similar cost reduction response or if other factors would occur that would result in a similar growth rate revision or a material revision to the other inputs to reporting unit fair value it could cause the fair value of the company’s reporting unit to fall below its carrying value potentially resulting in an impairment of goodwill 

the company is involved in various investigations claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business including alleged infringement of intellectual property rights commercial disputes labor and employment matters tax audits and other matters the company reviews the status of these matters assesses its financial exposure and records a related accrual if the potential loss from an investigation claim or legal proceeding is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable significant judgment is involved in the determination of probability and in the determination of whether an exposure is reasonably estimable as a result of the uncertainties involved in making these estimates the company may have to revise its estimates as facts and circumstances change the revision of these estimates could have a material impact on the company’s financial position and results of operations 

the company grants options to purchase its common stock to employees and directors under the company’s stock option plan eligible employees can also purchase shares of the company’s common stock at a discount under the company’s employee stock purchase plan the benefits provided under these plans are sharebased payments subject to the provisions of sharebased payment accounting guidance the company uses the fair value method to apply the provisions of sharebased payment accounting guidance sharebased compensation expense for 2011 2010 and 2009 was 231 million 190 million and 132 million respectively as of december 31 2011 total unrecognized estimated compensation expense related to unvested stock options granted prior to that date was 588 million which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 20 years net stock options after forfeitures and cancellations granted during 2011 2010 and 2009 represented 108 126 and 134 respectively of outstanding shares as of the beginning of each fiscal year net stock options after forfeitures and cancellations granted during 2011 2010 and 2009 represented 106 124 and 133 respectively of outstanding shares as of the end of each fiscal year in addition during 2011 the company issued 418371 options pursuant to assumed stock options associated with the acquisition of apache representing 046 and 045 of outstanding shares as of the beginning and end of the 2011 fiscal year respectively no options issued associated with the acquisition were fully vested as of the acquisition date 

  

the value of each sharebased award was estimated on the date of grant or date of acquisition for options issued in a business combination using the blackscholes option pricing model “blackscholes model” the determination of the fair value of sharebased payment awards using an option pricing model is affected by the company’s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables these variables include the company’s expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors riskfree interest rates and expected dividends the table below presents the weighted average input assumptions used and resulting fair values for options granted or issued in business combinations during each respective year the stockbased compensation expense for options is recorded ratably over their requisite service period the interest rates used were determined by using the fiveyear us treasury note yield on the date of grant or date of acquisition 

 

 the company issues both nonqualified and incentive stock options however incentive stock options comprise a significant portion of outstanding stock options the tax benefits associated with incentive stock options are unpredictable as they are predicated upon an award recipient triggering an event that disqualifies the award and that then results in a tax deduction to the company sharebased payment accounting guidance requires that these tax benefits be recorded at the time of the triggering event the triggering events for each option holder are not easily projected in order to estimate the tax benefits related to incentive stock options the company makes many assumptions and estimates including the number of incentive stock options that will be exercised during the period by us employees the number of incentive stock options that will be disqualified during the period and the fair market value of the company’s stock price on the exercise dates each of these items is subject to significant uncertainty additionally a significant portion of the tax benefits related to disqualified incentive stock options is accounted for as an increase to equity additional paidin capital rather than as a reduction in income tax expense although all such benefits continue to be realized through the company’s tax filings this accounting treatment has the effect of increasing tax expense and reducing net income for example the company realized a tax benefit of 67 million during the year ended december 31 2011 related to disqualified dispositions of incentive stock options however only 12 million of such amount was recorded as a reduction in income tax expense 

under the terms of the ansys inc longterm incentive plan in the first quarter of 2011 and 2010 the company granted 92500 and 80500 performancebased restricted stock units respectively vesting of the full award or a portion thereof is based on the company’s performance as measured by total shareholder return relative to the median percentage appreciation of the nasdaq composite index over a specified measurement period subject to each participant’s continued employment with the company through the conclusion of the measurement period the measurement period for the restricted stock units granted pursuant to the longterm incentive plan is a threeyear period beginning january 1 of the year of the grant each restricted stock unit relates to one share of the company’s common stock the value of each restricted stock unit granted in 2011 was estimated on the grant date to be 3205 and the value of each restricted stock unit granted in 2010 was estimated on the grant date to be 2500 the estimate of the grant date value of the restricted stock units was made using a monte carlo lattice pricing model the determination of the fair value of the awards was affected by the grant date and a number of variables each of which has been identified in the chart below sharebased compensation expense based on the fair value of the award is being recorded from the grant date through the conclusion of the threeyear measurement period 

  

  

 in addition the company grants deferred stock units to nonaffiliate independent directors which are rights to receive shares of common stock upon termination of service as a director the deferred stock units are issued in arrears and vest immediately with the exception of the chairman’s units which are issued in the period earned as of december 31 2011 66704 deferred stock units have been earned with the underlying shares remaining unissued until the service termination of the respective director owners of this amount 21684 units were earned during the year ended december 31 2011 in addition in the second quarter of 2011 13631 deferred stock units were issued as a result of the termination of service of a director for which 2031 units were earned during the 2011 calendar year 

if factors change and the company employs different assumptions in the application of sharebased payment accounting guidance in future periods the compensation expense that the company will record may differ significantly from what the company has recorded in the current period therefore it is important for investors to be aware of the high degree of subjectivity involved when using option pricing models to estimate sharebased compensation option pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions are fully transferable and do not cause dilution because the company’s sharebased payments have characteristics significantly different from those of freelytraded options and because changes in the input assumptions can materially affect the company’s estimates of fair values in the company’s opinion existing valuation models may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of the company’s sharebased compensation consequently there is a risk that the company’s estimates of the fair values of the company’s sharebased compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise expiration early termination or forfeiture of those sharebased payments in the future certain sharebased payments such as employee stock options may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in the company’s financial statements alternatively value may be realized from these instruments that is significantly in excess of the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in the company’s financial statements there is currently no marketbased mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models nor is there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values although the fair value of employee sharebased awards is determined in accordance with sharebased payment accounting guidance using an option pricing model that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyerseller market transaction 

estimates of sharebased compensation expenses are significant to the company’s financial statements but these expenses are based on the aforementioned option valuation models and will never result in the payment of cash by the company for this reason and because the company does not view sharebased compensation as related to its operational performance the board of directors and management exclude estimated sharebased compensation expense when evaluating the company’s underlying business performance

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend interest income rate risk  changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest income that is generated from the company’s cash and shortterm investments for the year ended december 31 2011 total interest income was 30 million cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of highly liquid investments such as money market mutual funds and deposits held at major banks 

interest expense rate risk  in connection with the ansoft acquisition the company entered into a 3550 million term loan with variable interest rates as of july 31 2008 the term loan is scheduled to mature on july 31 2013 and provides for tiered pricing with the initial rate at the prime rate  050 or the libor rate  150 with step downs permitted after the initial six months under the credit agreement down to a flat prime rate or the libor rate  075 such tiered pricing is determined by the company’s consolidated leverage ratio the credit agreement includes quarterly financial covenants requiring the company to maintain certain financial ratios and as is customary for facilities of this type certain events of default that permit the acceleration of the loan borrowings outstanding under this facility totaled 1276 million as of december 31 2011 

the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement in order to hedge a portion of each of the first eight forecasted quarterly variable rate interest payments on the company’s term loan under the swap agreement the company received the variable threemonth libor rate required under its term loan and paid a fixed libor interest rate of 332 on the notional amount the initial notional amount of 3000 million was amortized equally at an amount of 375 million per quarter over eight quarters through june 30 2010 the interest rate swap agreement terminated on june 30 2010 

for the year ended december 31 2011 the company recorded interest expense related to the term loan at a weighted average interest rate of 105 for the year ended december 31 2010 the company recorded interest expense related to the term loan at a weighted average interest rate of 153 if the company did not enter into the interest rate swap agreement the weighted average interest rate would have been 108 for the year ended december 31 2009 the company recorded interest expense related to the term loan at a weighted average interest rate of 341 if the company did not enter into the interest rate swap agreement the weighted average interest rate would have been 188 the interest expense on the term loan and amortization related to debt financing costs were as follows 

 

 the interest rate on the outstanding term loan balance of 1276 million is set for the quarter ending march 31 2012 at 133 which is based on the libor rate  075 as of december 31 2011 the fair value of the debt approximated the recorded value 

based on the effective interest rates and remaining outstanding borrowings at december 31 2011 a 050 increase in interest rates would not impact the company’s interest expense for the quarter ending march 31 2012 based on the effective interest rates and remaining outstanding borrowings at december 31 2011 assuming contractual quarterly principal payments are made a 050 increase in interest rates would increase the company’s interest expense by approximately 500000 for the year ending december 31 2012 

  

foreign currency transaction risk  as the company continues to expand its business presence in international regions the portion of its revenue expenses cash accounts receivable and payment obligations denominated in foreign currencies continues to increase as a result changes in currency exchange rates will affect the company’s financial position results of operations and cash flows the company is most impacted by movements in and among the british pound euro japanese yen canadian dollar indian rupee swedish krona chinese renminbi korean won taiwan dollar and the us dollar 

with respect to revenue on average for the year ended december 31 2011 the us dollar was approximately 53 weaker when measured against the company’s primary foreign currencies than for the year ended december 31 2010 the net overall weakening resulted in increased revenue and operating income during 2011 as compared with 2010 of approximately 198 million and 126 million respectively 

the company’s operating results are favorably impacted when the us dollar weakens against the company’s primary foreign currencies and are adversely impacted when the us dollar strengthens against the company’s primary foreign currencies had the activity for the year ended december 31 2011 been recorded at the december 31 2011 spot rates for each subsidiary’s functional currency the revenue and operating income for the year would have decreased by 110 million and 49 million respectively 

the most significant currency impacts on revenue and operating income were primarily attributable to us dollar exchange rate changes against the euro british pound and japanese yen as reflected in the charts below 

 

  

 the company has foreign currency denominated intercompany payablesreceivables with certain foreign subsidiaries in order to provide a natural hedge the company will purchase foreign currencies and hold these currencies in cash until the intercompany payablesreceivables are settled these natural hedges mitigate a portion of the foreign currency exchange risk on the intercompany payablesreceivables

the company regards its software as proprietary and relies on a combination of trade secret copyright patent and trademark laws license agreements nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect its proprietary rights in its products the company distributes its software products under software license agreements that grant customers nonexclusive licenses for the use of the company’s products which are typically nontransferable license agreements for the company’s products are directly between the company and end users use of the licensed software product is restricted to specified sites unless the customer obtains a multisite license for its use of the software product software security measures are also employed to prevent unauthorized use of the company’s software products and the licensed software is subject to terms and conditions prohibiting unauthorized reproduction customers may purchase a perpetual license of the technology with the right to annually purchase ongoing maintenance technical support and updates or may lease the product on a fixed term basis for a fee that includes the license maintenance technical support and upgrades 

the company licenses its software products utilizing a combination of webbased and hard copy license terms and forms for certain software products the company primarily relies on “clickwrapped” licenses the enforceability of these types of agreements under the laws of some jurisdictions is uncertain 

the company also seeks to protect the source code of its software as a trade secret and as unpublished copyrighted work the company has obtained federal trademark registration protection for ansys autodyn cfx fluent maxwell and other marks in the us and in foreign countries additionally the company was awarded a patent by the us patent and trademark office for its webbased reporting technology and has a number of patent applications pending 

employees of the company have signed agreements under which they have agreed not to disclose trade secrets or confidential information and where legally permitted that restrict engagement in or connection with any business that is competitive with the company anywhere in the world while employed by the company and in some cases for specified periods thereafter and that any products or technology created by them during their term of employment are the property of the company in addition the company requires all channel partners to enter into agreements not to disclose the company’s trade secrets and other proprietary information 

despite these precautions there can be no assurance that misappropriation of the company’s technology and proprietary information will not occur further there can be no assurance that copyright trademark patent and trade secret protection will be available for the company’s products in certain jurisdictions or that restrictions on the ability of employees and channel partners to engage in activities competitive with the company will be enforceable 

the software development industry is characterized by rapid technological change therefore the company believes that factors such as the technological and creative skills of its personnel new product developments frequent product enhancements name recognition and reliable product maintenance are also important to establishing and maintaining technology leadership in addition to the various legal protections of its technology that may be available 

the company does not believe that any of its products infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties there can be no assurance however that third parties will not claim such infringement by the company or its 

  

licensors or licensees with respect to current or future products the company expects that software suppliers will increasingly be subject to the risk of such claims as the number of products and suppliers continues to expand and the functionality of products continues to increase any such claims with or without merit could be time consuming result in costly litigation cause product shipment delays or require the company to enter into royalty or licensing agreements such royalty or licensing agreements if required may not be available on terms acceptable to the company 

seasonal variations 

the company’s business has experienced seasonality including quarterly reductions in software sales resulting from the slowdown during the summer months particularly in europe as well as from the seasonal purchasing and budgeting patterns of the company’s global customers the company’s revenue and margins are typically highest in the fourth quarter 

backlog 

the company generally ships its products within 30 days after acceptance of an order and execution of a software license agreement accordingly the company does not believe that its backlog at any particular point in time is indicative of future sales levels as of december 31 2010 the company had no significant backlog of orders received but not invoiced 

employees 

as of december 31 2010 the company and its subsidiaries had approximately 1660 fulltime employees at that date there were also contract personnel and coop students providing ongoing development services and technical support the company believes that its relationship with its employees is good

 item 1a risk factors tableend information provided by the company or its spokespersons including information contained in this annual report on form 10k may from time to time contain forwardlooking statements concerning projected financial performance market and industry sector growth product development and commercialization or other aspects of future operations such statements will be based on the assumptions and expectations of the company’s management at the time such statements are made the company cautions investors that its performance and therefore any forwardlooking statement is subject to risks and uncertainties various important factors including but not limited to the following may cause the company’s future results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statement 

volatility in the global economy and disruption in financial markets the financial markets in certain geographies continue to experience disruption including among other things volatility in securities prices diminished liquidity and credit availability rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others while currently these conditions have not impaired the company’s ability to access credit markets and 

  

finance operations there can be no assurance that there will not be continued instability in or renewed deterioration of financial markets and confidence in major economies the company is impacted by these economic developments both domestically and globally in that the current tightening of credit in certain financial markets adversely affects the ability of its customers and suppliers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations and could result in a decrease in orders for the company’s products and services these economic conditions may negatively impact the company as some of its customers defer purchasing decisions thereby lengthening the company’s sales cycles in addition certain of the company’s customers’ budgets may be constrained and they may be unable to purchase our products at the same level the company’s customers’ ability to pay for the company’s products and services may also be impaired which may lead to an increase in the company’s allowance for doubtful accounts and writeoffs of accounts receivable the company is unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the current economic conditions or the ongoing instability of such conditions should these economic conditions and continuing volatility in those conditions result in the company not meeting its revenue growth objectives the company’s operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

decline in customers’ business the company’s sales are based significantly on end user demand for products in key industrial sectors many of these sectors periodically experience economic declines which may be exacerbated by other economic factors including the recent global economic disruptions these factors may adversely affect the company’s business by extending sales cycles and reducing revenue these economic factors may cause the company’s customers to reduce the size of their workforce or cut back on operations and may lead to a reduction in license renewals or ongoing maintenance contracts with the company the company’s customers may also request discounts or extended payment terms on new products or seek to extend payment terms on existing contracts all of which may cause fluctuations in the company’s future operating results the company may not be able to adjust its operating expenses to offset such fluctuations because a substantial portion of the company’s operating expenses is related to personnel facilities and marketing programs the level of personnel and related expenses may not be able to be adjusted quickly and is based in significant part on the company’s expectation for future revenue 

risks associated with international activities a majority of the company’s business comes from outside the united states and the company has customers that supply a wide spectrum of goods and services in virtually all of the world’s major economic regions as the company continues to expand its sales presence in international regions the portion of its revenue expenses cash accounts receivable and payment obligations denominated in foreign currencies continues to increase the company’s revenues and operating results are adversely affected when the us dollar strengthens relative to other currencies and are positively affected when the us dollar weakens as a result changes in currency exchange rates will affect the company’s financial position results of operations and cash flows in the event that there are economic declines in countries in which the company conducts transactions the resulting changes in currency exchange rates may from time to time affect the company’s financial position results of operations and cash flows the company is most impacted by movements in and among the british pound euro japanese yen canadian dollar indian rupee swedish krona chinese renminbi korean won taiwan dollar and the us dollar the company seeks to reduce these risks primarily through its normal operating and treasury activities but there can be no assurance it will be successful in reducing these risks 

additional risks inherent in the company’s international business activities include imposition of government controls export license requirements restrictions on the export of critical technology products and services political and economic instability trade restrictions changes in tariffs and taxes difficulties in staffing and managing international operations longer accounts receivable payment cycles and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations effective patent copyright trademark and trade secret protection may not be available in every foreign country in which the company sells its products and services the company’s business financial position results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks 

  

  

stock market and stock price volatility market prices for securities of software companies have generally been volatile in particular the market price of the company’s common stock has been and may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations as a result of factors affecting the company the software industry or the securities markets in general such factors include but are not limited to declines in trading price that may be triggered by the company’s failure to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors in connection with recent volatility in global economic conditions the prices of equity securities including the price of the company’s common stock experienced price and volume volatility in many cases disproportionate to the underlying operating performance of the affected companies the company’s common stock was at its lowest closing price during the year ended december 31 2010 on august 31 2010 at a price of 3878 per share as of december 31 2010 the company’s common stock closed at 5207 per share moreover the trading price could be subject to additional fluctuations in response to quartertoquarter variations in the company’s operating results material announcements made by the company or its competitors conditions in the financial markets or the software industry generally or other events and factors many of which are beyond the company’s control 

rapidly changing technology new products risk of product defects the company operates in an industry generally characterized by rapidly changing technology and frequent new product introductions which can render existing products obsolete or unmarketable a major factor in the company’s future success will be its ability to anticipate technological changes and to develop and introduce in a timely manner enhancements to its existing products products acquired in acquisitions and new products to meet those changes if the company is unable to introduce new products and to respond quickly to industry changes its business financial position results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

the introduction and marketing of new or enhanced products require the company to manage the transition from existing products in order to minimize disruption in customer purchasing patterns there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing and marketing on a timely basis new products or product enhancements that its new products will adequately address the changing needs of the marketplace or that it will successfully manage the transition from existing products software products as complex as those offered by the company may contain undetected errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are released and the likelihood of errors is increased as a result of the company’s commitment to the frequency of its product releases there can be no assurance that errors will not be found in any new or enhanced products after commencement of commercial shipments certain of these products require a higher level of sales and support expertise the ability of the company’s sales channel particularly the indirect channel to obtain this expertise and to sell the new product offerings effectively could have an adverse impact on the company’s sales in future periods any of these problems may result in the loss of or delay in customer acceptance diversion of development resources damage to the company’s reputation or increased service and warranty costs any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

competition the company continues to experience competition across all markets for its products and services some of the company’s current and possible future competitors have greater financial technical marketing and other resources than the company and some have well established relationships with current and potential customers of the company the company’s current and possible future competitors also include firms that have or may in the future elect to compete by means of open source licensing these competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes price reductions andor increased operating costs and could result in lower revenues margins and net income 

changes in the company’s pricing models the intense competition the company faces in the sales of its products and services and general economic and business conditions can put pressure on the company to adjust its prices if the company’s competitors offer deep discounts on certain products or services or develop products that the marketplace considers more valuable the company may need to lower prices or offer other favorable terms in order to compete successfully any such changes may reduce operating margins and could adversely affect operating results the company’s software license updates and product support fees are generally priced as 

  

a percentage of its net new software license fees the company’s competitors may offer lower percentage pricing on product updates and support which could put pressure on the company to further discount its new license prices 

any broadbased change to the company’s prices and pricing policies could cause new software license and service revenues to decline or be delayed as its sales force implements and its customers adjust to the new pricing policies some of the company’s competitors may bundle software products for promotional purposes or as a longterm pricing strategy or provide guarantees of prices and product implementations these practices could over time significantly constrain the prices that the company can charge for certain of its products if the company does not adapt its pricing models to reflect changes in customer use of its products or changes in customer demand the company’s new software license revenues could decrease additionally increased distribution of applications through application service providers including softwareasaservice providers may reduce the average price for the company’s products or adversely affect other sales of the company’s products reducing new software license revenues unless the company can offset price reductions with volume increases the increase in open source software distribution may also cause the company to adjust its pricing models 

dependence on senior management and key technical personnel the company’s success depends upon the continued services of the company’s senior executives key technical employees and other employees each of the company’s executive officers key technical personnel and other employees could terminate his or her relationship with the company at any time the loss of any of the company’s senior executives might significantly delay or prevent the achievement of the company’s business objectives and could materially harm the company’s business and customer relationships in addition because of the highly technical nature of the company’s products the loss of any significant number of existing engineering and development personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business and operating results 

dependence on proprietary technology the company’s success is highly dependent upon its proprietary technology the company generally relies on contracts and the laws of copyright and trade secrets to protect its technology the company maintains a trade secrets program enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees and channel partners and limits access to and distribution of its software documentation and other proprietary information there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company to protect its proprietary technology will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of its technology by third parties or that third parties will not be able to develop similar technology independently although the company is not aware that any of its technology infringes upon the rights of third parties there can be no assurance that other parties will not assert technology infringement claims against the company or that if asserted such claims will not prevail 

dependence on channel partners the company continues to distribute a meaningful portion of its products through its global network of independent regional channel partners the channel partners sell the company’s software products to new and existing customers expand installations within the existing customer base offer consulting services and provide the first line of technical support consequently in certain geographies the company is highly dependent upon the efforts of the channel partners difficulties in ongoing relationships with channel partners such as failure to meet performance criteria or to promote the company’s products as aggressively as the company expects and differences in the handling of customer relationships could adversely affect the company’s performance additionally the loss of any major channel partner for any reason including a channel partner’s decision to sell competing products rather than the company’s products could have a material adverse effect on the company moreover the company’s future success will depend substantially on the ability and willingness of its channel partners to continue to dedicate the resources necessary to promote the company’s portfolio of products and to support a larger installed base of the company’s products if the channel partners are unable or unwilling to do so the company may be unable to sustain revenue growth 

during times of significant fluctuations in world currencies certain channel partners may have solvency issues to the extent that effective hedge transactions are not employed or there is not sufficient working capital in particular if the us dollar strengthens relative to other currencies certain channel partners who pay the 

  

company in us dollars may have trouble paying the company on time or may have trouble distributing the company’s products due to the impact of the currency exchange fluctuation on such channel partner’s cash flows this may impact the company’s ability to distribute its products into certain regions and markets and may have an adverse effect on the company’s results of operations and cash flows 

reliance on perpetual licenses although the company has historically maintained stable recurring revenue from the sale of software lease licenses and software maintenance subscriptions it also has relied on sales of perpetual licenses that involve payment of a single upfront fee and that are more typical in the computer software industry additionally the acquisition of ansoft resulted in an increase in the company’s perpetual license revenue as compared to its total revenue while revenue generated from software lease licenses and software maintenance subscriptions currently represents a portion of the company’s revenue to the extent that perpetual license revenue continues to represent a significant percentage of total revenue the company’s revenue in any period will depend increasingly on sales completed during that period 

risks associated with acquisitions historically the company has consummated acquisitions in order to support the company’s longterm strategic direction accelerate innovation provide increased capabilities to its existing products supply new products and services expand its customer base and enhance its distribution channels in the future the company may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or if suitable candidates are identified the company may not be able to complete the business combination on commercially acceptable terms the process of exploring and pursuing acquisition opportunities may result in devotion of significant management and financial resources 

even if the company is able to consummate acquisitions that it believes will be successful such transactions present many risks significant risks to such acquisitions include among others failing to achieve anticipated synergies and revenue increases difficulty incorporating and integrating the acquired technologies or products with the company’s existing product lines difficulty in coordinating establishing or expanding sales distribution and marketing functions as necessary disruption of the company’s ongoing business and diversion of management’s attention to transition or integration issues unanticipated and unknown liabilities the loss of key employees customers partners and channel partners of the company or of the acquired company and difficulties implementing and maintaining sufficient controls policies and procedures over the systems products and processes of the acquired company if the company does not achieve the anticipated benefits of its acquisitions as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by the company’s management and financial or industry analysts or if others do not perceive the same benefits of the acquisition as the company there could be a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in addition for companies acquired limited experience will exist for several quarters following the acquisition relating to how the acquired company’s sales pipelines will convert into sales or revenues and the conversion rate postacquisition may be quite different than the historical conversion rate because a substantial portion of the company’s sales are completed in the latter part of a quarter and its cost structure is largely fixed in the short term revenue shortfalls may have a negative impact on the company’s profitability a delay in a small number of large new software license transactions could cause the company’s quarterly software license revenues to fall significantly short of its predictions 

disruption of operations or infrastructure failures a significant portion of the company’s software development personnel source code and computer equipment is located at operating facilities in the united states canada india japan and throughout europe the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unforeseen catastrophe at any of these facilities could cause interruptions in the company’s operations services and product development activities additionally if the company experiences problems that impair its business infrastructure such as a computer virus telephone system failure or an intentional disruption of its information technology systems by a third party these interruptions could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial position results of operations cash flows and the ability to meet financial reporting timelines 

further because the company’s sales are not generally linear during any quarterly period the potential adverse 

  

effects resulting from any of the events described above or any other disruption of the company’s business could be accentuated if it occurs close to the end of a fiscal quarter 

sales forecasts the company makes many operational and strategic decisions based upon short and longterm sales forecasts the company’s sales personnel continually monitor the status of all proposals including the estimated closing date and the value of the sale in order to forecast quarterly sales these forecasts are subject to significant estimation and are impacted by many external factors including global economic conditions and the performance of the company’s customers a variation in actual sales activity from that forecasted could cause the company to plan or to budget incorrectly and therefore could adversely affect the company’s business financial position results of operations and cash flows the company’s management team forecasts macroeconomic trends and developments and integrates them through longrange planning into budgets research and development strategies and a wide variety of general management duties global economic conditions and the effect those conditions and other disruptions in global markets have on the company’s customers may have a significant impact on the accuracy of the company’s sales forecasts these conditions may increase the likelihood or the magnitude of variations between actual sales activity and the company’s sales forecasts and as a result the company’s performance may be hindered because of a failure to properly match corporate strategy with economic conditions this in turn may adversely affect the company’s business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

risks associated with significant sales to existing customers a significant portion of the company’s sales include followon sales to existing customers that invest in the company’s broad suite of engineering simulation software and services if a significant number of current customers were to become dissatisfied with the company’s products and services or choose to license or utilize competitive offerings the company’s followon sales and recurring lease and maintenance revenues could be materially adversely impacted resulting in reduced revenue operating margins net income and cash flows 

income tax estimates the company makes significant estimates in determining its worldwide income tax provision these estimates involve complex tax regulations in a number of jurisdictions across the company’s global operations and are subject to many transactions and calculations in which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain the final outcome of tax matters could be different than the estimates reflected in the historical income tax provision and related accruals such differences could have a material impact on income tax expense and net income in the periods in which such determinations are made 

the amount of income tax paid by the company is subject to ongoing audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities these audits can often result in additional assessments the company’s estimate for liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions is highly judgmental and actual future results may result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to the company’s estimated tax liabilities including estimates for uncertain tax positions in the period the assessments are made or resolved audits are closed or when statutes of limitations on potential assessments expire as a result the company’s effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly or annual basis 

the company allocates a portion of its purchase price to goodwill and intangible assets impairment charges associated with goodwill are generally not tax deductible and will result in an increased effective income tax rate in the period the impairment is recorded the company has recorded significant deferred tax liabilities related to acquired intangible assets that are not deductible for tax purposes these deferred tax liabilities are based on future statutory tax rates in the locations in which the intangible assets are recorded any future changes in statutory tax rates would be recorded as an adjustment to the deferred tax liabilities in the period the change is announced and could have a material impact on the company’s effective tax rate during that period 

periodic reorganization of sales force the company relies heavily on its direct sales force from time to time the company reorganizes and makes adjustments to its sales force in response to such factors as management changes performance issues market opportunities and other considerations these changes may 

  

result in a temporary lack of sales production and may adversely impact revenue in future quarters there can be no assurance that the company will not restructure its sales force in future periods or that the transition issues associated with such a restructuring will not occur 

regulatory compliance like all other public companies the company is subject to the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission “sec” including those that require the company to report on and receive an attestation from its independent registered public accounting firm regarding the company’s internal control over financial reporting compliance with these requirements causes the company to incur additional expenses and causes management to divert time from the daytoday operations of the company while the company anticipates being able to fully comply with these requirements if it is not able to comply with the sarbanesoxley reporting or attestation requirements relating to internal control over financial reporting the company may be subject to sanctions by the sec or nasdaq such sanctions could divert the attention of the company’s management from implementing its business plan and could have an adverse effect on the company’s business and results of operations 

as the company’s stock is listed on the nasdaq global select market the company is subject to the ongoing financial and corporate governance requirements of nasdaq while the company anticipates being able to fully comply with these requirements if it is not able to comply the company’s name may be published on nasdaq’s daily noncompliant companies list until nasdaq determines that it has regained compliance or the company no longer trades on nasdaq if the company were unable to return to compliance with the governance requirements of nasdaq the company may be delisted from the nasdaq global select market which could have an adverse effect on the company’s ability to raise additional capital 

governmental revenue sources the company’s sales to the united states government must comply with the regulations set forth in the federal acquisition regulations failure to comply with these regulations could result in penalties being assessed against the company or an order preventing the company from making future sales to the united states government further the company’s international activities must comply with the export control laws of the united states the foreign corrupt practices act and a variety of other laws and regulations of the united states and other countries in which the company operates failure to comply with any of these laws and regulations could adversely affect the company’s business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

in certain circumstances the united states government state and local governments and their respective agencies and certain foreign governments may have the right to terminate contractual arrangements at any time without cause the united states european union and certain other government contracts as well as the company’s state and local level contracts are subject to the approval of appropriations or funding authorizations certain of these contracts permit the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions including but not limited to termination of contracts refund of a portion of fees received forfeiture of profits suspension of payments fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business any of which could have an adverse effect on the company’s results of operations and cash flows 

contingencies the company is involved in various investigations claims and legal proceedings from time to time that arise in the ordinary course of its business activities including alleged infringement of intellectual property rights commercial disputes employment matters tax audits and other matters each of these matters is subject to various uncertainties and it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could in the future materially affect the company’s results of operations cash flows or financial position 

changes in existing financial accounting standards changes in existing accounting rules or practices new accounting pronouncements or varying interpretations of current accounting pronouncements could have a significant adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or the manner in which the company conducts its business 

  

  

changes in tax law the company’s operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions a change in the tax law in the jurisdictions in which the company does business including an increase in tax rates or an adverse change in the treatment of an item of income or expense could result in a material increase in tax expense currently a substantial portion of the company’s revenue is generated from customers located outside the united states and a substantial portion of assets are located outside the united states united states income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings for nonunited states subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries changes in existing taxation rules or practices new taxation rules or varying interpretations of current taxation practices could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or the manner in which the company conducts its business 

renewal rates for annual lease and maintenance contracts a substantial portion of the company’s license and maintenance revenue is derived from annual lease and maintenance contracts these contracts are generally renewed on an annual basis and typically have a high rate of customer renewal in addition to the recurring revenue base associated with these contracts a majority of customers purchasing new perpetual licenses also purchase related annual maintenance contracts if the rate of renewal for these contracts is adversely affected by economic or other factors the company’s license and maintenance growth will be adversely affected over the term that the revenue for those contracts would have otherwise been recognized as a result the company’s business financial position results of operations and cash flows may also be adversely impacted during those periods

the operating results of ansoft have been included in the company’s consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition july 31 2008 the total purchase price was allocated to the foreign and domestic assets and liabilities of ansoft based upon management’s estimates of the fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed the allocation included 2352 million to identifiable intangible assets including 984 million to developed software to be amortized over ten years 974 million to customer contracts and related relationships to be amortized over 13 years and 394 million to trademarks to be amortized over ten years and 5992 million to goodwill which is not tax deductible

for purposes of the following discussion and analysis the table below sets forth certain consolidated financial data for the years 2010 2009 and 2008 

 

   

year ended december 31 2010 compared to year ended december 31 2009 

revenue 

 

 the company’s revenue increased 123 in 2010 as compared to 2009 including increases in license and maintenance revenue perpetual license revenue which is derived entirely from new sales during the period increased 238 this strong growth was partially influenced by an improvement in the global economy as compared to the prior year period the annual maintenance contracts that were sold with the new perpetual licenses along with the renewal of maintenance contracts sold with new perpetual licenses in previous years contributed to maintenance revenue growth of 157 also contributing to this growth was an improvement in the rate of renewals including the delayed renewal during the year ended december 31 2010 of maintenance contracts that were due for renewal in previous periods lease license revenue increased more modestly at 19 service revenue decreased 39 in 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily the result of reduced revenue from engineering consulting services 

with respect to revenue on average for the year ended december 31 2010 the us dollar was approximately 01 stronger when measured against the company’s primary foreign currencies than for the year ended december 31 2009 the us dollar strengthened against the british pound and euro while it weakened against the japanese yen korean won taiwan dollar chinese renminbi swedish krona indian rupee and canadian dollar the net overall strengthening resulted in decreased revenue and operating income during 2010 as compared with 2009 of approximately 200000 and 600000 respectively 

a substantial portion of the company’s license and maintenance revenue is derived from annual lease and maintenance contracts these contracts are generally renewed on an annual basis and typically have a high rate of customer renewal in addition to the recurring revenue base associated with these contracts a majority of customers purchasing new perpetual licenses also purchase related annual maintenance contracts as a result of the significant recurring revenue base the company’s license and maintenance revenue growth rate in any period does not necessarily correlate to the growth rate of new license and maintenance contracts sold during that period to the extent the rate of customer renewal for lease and maintenance contracts is high incremental lease contracts and maintenance contracts sold with new perpetual licenses will result in license and maintenance revenue growth conversely if the rate of renewal for these contracts is adversely affected by economic or other factors the company’s license and maintenance growth will be adversely affected over the term that the revenue for those contracts would have otherwise been recognized 

the company generally invoices its customers upfront for software licenses and maintenance contracts as a result the company has no significant backlog of orders received but not invoiced 

international and domestic revenues as a percentage of total revenue were 675 and 325 respectively during the year ended december 31 2010 and 667 and 333 respectively during the year ended december 31 2009

cost of sales and gross profit 

 

 software licenses the increase in software license costs was primarily a result of an increase in salaries and incentive compensation of 400000 

amortization the decrease in amortization expense was a result of a 33 million decrease in amortization of acquired software 

maintenance and service the increase in maintenance and service costs is primarily due to the following 

 

  

  

  

  

 restructuring charges the company incurred restructuring charges of 994000 associated with 2009 workforce reduction activities that related to the company’s ongoing effort to manage expenses and cost structure 

the improvement in the gross profit was a result of the increase in revenue offset by a smaller increase in related cost of sales 

  

operating expenses 

 

 selling general and administrative the increase in selling general and administrative costs was primarily a result of increased incentive compensation of 89 million increased stockbased compensation expense of 35 million increased discretionary marketing and event costs of 17 million increased franchise taxes of 13 million increased business travel expenses of 11 million increased thirdparty commissions of 900000 and increased facility and equipment maintenance costs of 700000 in addition the company incurred a onetime charge of approximately 900000 500000 of which was charged to selling general and administrative expenses related to the withdrawal from an existing employee benefit plan as a result of restructuring the company’s japan subsidiaries these increases were partially offset by decreased office lease expenses of 800000 

the company anticipates that it will continue to make targeted investments in its global sales and marketing organization and its global business infrastructure to enhance major account sales activities and to support its worldwide sales distribution and marketing strategies and the business in general 

research and development the increase in research and development costs was a result of increased salaries and headcountrelated costs including incentive compensation of 50 million increased stockbased compensation expense of 18 million and increased facility and equipment maintenance costs of 900000 

the company has traditionally invested significant resources in research and development activities and intends to continue to make investments in this area particularly as it relates to expanding the capabilities of its flagship products and other products within its broad portfolio of simulation software evolution of its ansys ® workbench ™ platform and ongoing integration 

amortization the decrease in amortization expense was a result of a 400000 decrease in amortization of an acquired customer list

interest expense  the company’s interest expense consists of the following 

 

   

the decreased interest costs shown above for the 2010 period are primarily a result of a lower weighted average effective interest rate of 153 as compared to 341 in the corresponding 2009 period and a lower average outstanding debt balance 

interest income  interest income for the year ended december 31 2010 was 19 million as compared to 17 million for the year ended december 31 2009 interest income increased as a result of an increase in invested cash balances partially offset by a decrease in interest rates in the 2010 period as compared to the 2009 period 

other expense net the company recorded other expense of 297000 during the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to other expense of 13 million during the year ended december 31 2009 the net change was primarily the result of foreign currency transaction gains and losses as the company’s presence in foreign locations continues to expand the company will have increased exposure to volatility of foreign exchange rates for the foreseeable future 

income tax provision the company recorded income tax expense of 633 million and had income before income taxes of 2164 million for the year ended december 31 2010 this represents an effective tax rate of 292 during the year ended december 31 2009 the company recorded income tax expense of 571 million and had income before income taxes of 1735 million representing an effective tax rate of 329 

when compared to the federal and state combined statutory rate these rates are favorably impacted by lower statutory tax rates in many of the company’s foreign jurisdictions domestic manufacturing deductions research and experimentation credits and tax benefits associated with the merger of the company’s japan subsidiaries in the third quarter of 2010 these rates are also impacted by charges or benefits associated with the company’s uncertain tax positions 

as a result of the subsidiary merger in japan the company realized a reduction in its fourth quarter 2010 income tax expense of 21 million related to tax credits in the us associated with foreign taxes paid in japan the company also expects that its future income tax expense will be reduced by the following amounts

the increase in maintenance revenue was primarily the result of annual maintenance subscriptions sold in connection with new perpetual license sales in recent quarters as well as the impact of ansoft operations for a full year in 2009 of 441 million as compared to five months in 2008 of 84 million 

the decrease in service revenue was primarily the result of reduced revenue from engineering consulting services as well as a reduction of 700000 related to the company’s 2008 biennial users’ conference

the company’s revenue increased 81 in 2009 this revenue growth rate was influenced by the company’s organic growth rate incremental growth from the acquisition of ansoft and the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations although the company’s overall revenue growth in 2009 benefited from the inclusion of a full year of ansoft operations as compared to five months of ansoft operations in 2008 the company experienced a reduction in the perpetual license revenue of the nonansoft operations caused by the disruption in domestic and global economies and the net adverse impact of currency fluctuations reductions in the company’s revenue growth rate adversely impacted the company’s operating income net income and earnings per share in 2009 

international and domestic revenues as a percentage of total revenue were 667 and 333 respectively during the year ended december 31 2009 and 683 and 317 respectively during the year ended december 31 2008

nongaap results 

the company provides nongaap revenue nongaap operating income nongaap operating profit margin nongaap net income and nongaap diluted earnings per share as supplemental measures to generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” regarding the company’s operational performance these financial measures exclude the impact of certain items and therefore have not been calculated in accordance with gaap a detailed explanation and a reconciliation of each nongaap financial measure to its most comparable gaap financial measure are included below 

 

  

     note the 2010 gaap and nongaap net income and earnings per share data reflected above include approximately 21 million or 002 per share related to tax benefits associated with the previouslyannounced restructuring of the company’s japan subsidiaries the 2009 gaap and nongaap net income and earnings per share data reflected above include approximately 20 million in tax charges during the fourth quarter of 2009 related to the repatriation of cash from the company’s international subsidiaries these amounts are offset by approximately 20 million in tax benefits during the second quarter of 2009 related to settlements of tax years previously under audit 

  

  

        

nongaap measures 

management uses nongaap financial measures a to evaluate the company’s historical and prospective financial performance as well as its performance relative to its competitors b to set internal sales targets and spending budgets c to allocate resources d to measure operational profitability and the accuracy of forecasting e to assess financial discipline over operational expenditures and f as an important factor in determining variable compensation for management and its employees in addition many financial analysts that follow the company focus on and publish both historical results and future projections based on nongaap financial measures the company believes that it is in the best interest of its investors to provide this information to analysts so that they accurately report the nongaap financial information moreover investors have historically requested and the company has historically reported these nongaap financial measures as a means of providing consistent and comparable information with past reports of financial results 

while management believes that these nongaap financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors there are limitations associated with the use of these nongaap financial measures these nongaap financial measures are not prepared in accordance with gaap are not reported by all of the company’s competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of the company’s competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation the company compensates for these limitations by using these nongaap financial measures as supplements to gaap financial measures and by reviewing the reconciliations of the nongaap financial measures to their most comparable gaap financial measures 

the adjustments to these nongaap financial measures and the basis for such adjustments are outlined below 

purchase accounting for deferred revenue and its related tax impact the company acquired ansoft corporation on july 31 2008 in accordance with the fair value provisions applicable to the accounting for business combinations acquired deferred revenue of approximately 75 million was recorded on the opening balance sheet which was approximately 235 million lower than the historical carrying value although this purchase accounting requirement had no impact on the company’s business or cash flow it adversely impacted the company’s reported gaap revenue primarily for the first twelve months postacquisition in order to provide investors with financial information that facilitates comparison of both historical and future results the company has provided nongaap financial measures which exclude the impact of the purchase accounting adjustment the company believes that this nongaap financial adjustment is useful to investors because it allows investors to a evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in its financial and operational decisionmaking and b compare past and future reports of financial results of the company as the revenue reduction related to acquired deferred revenue will not recur when related annual lease licenses and software maintenance contracts are renewed in future periods 

amortization of intangibles from acquisitions and its related tax impact the company incurs amortization of intangibles included in its gaap presentation of amortization expense related to various acquisitions it has made in recent years management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating nongaap operating income nongaap operating profit margin nongaap net income and nongaap diluted earnings per share when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the company because these costs are fixed at the time of an acquisition are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition accordingly management does not consider these expenses for purposes of evaluating the performance of the company during the applicable time period after the acquisition and it excludes such expenses when making decisions to allocate resources the company believes that these nongaap financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to a evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in its financial and operational decisionmaking and b compare past reports of financial results of the company as the company has historically reported these nongaap financial measures 

  

  

stockbased compensation expense and its related tax impact the company incurs expense related to stockbased compensation included in its gaap presentation of cost of software licenses cost of maintenance and service research and development expense and selling general and administrative expense although stockbased compensation is an expense of the company and viewed as a form of compensation management excludes these expenses for the purpose of calculating nongaap operating income nongaap operating profit margin nongaap net income and nongaap diluted earnings per share when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the company specifically the company excludes stockbased compensation during its annual budgeting process and its quarterly and annual assessments of the company’s and management’s performance the annual budgeting process is the primary mechanism whereby the company allocates resources to various initiatives and operational requirements additionally the annual review by the board of directors during which it compares the company’s historical business model and profitability as it relates to the planned business model and profitability for the forthcoming year excludes the impact of stockbased compensation in evaluating the performance of senior management and department managers charges related to stockbased compensation are excluded from expenditure and profitability results in fact the company records stockbased compensation expense into a standalone cost center for which no single operational manager is responsible or accountable in this way management is able to review on a periodtoperiod basis each manager’s performance and assess financial discipline over operational expenditures without the effect of stockbased compensation the company believes that these nongaap financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to a evaluate the company’s operating results and the effectiveness of the methodology used by management to review the company’s operating results and b review historical comparability in its financial reporting as well as comparability with competitors’ operating results 

nongaap financial measures are not in accordance with or an alternative for generally accepted accounting principles in the united states the company’s nongaap financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable gaap financial measures and should be read only in conjunction with the company’s consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap

the company’s investing activities used net cash of 107 million during 2009 and 3380 million during 2008 total capital spending was 83 million during 2009 and 166 million during 2008 during 2008 the company had net acquisitionrelated cash outlays of approximately 3201 million related to the acquisition of ansoft in 2009 and 2008 purchases of shortterm investments exceeded maturities by 24 million and 12 million respectively 

cash flows from financing activities financing activities used cash of 296 million for the year ended december 31 2010 and used cash of 641 million for the year ended december 31 2009 this change of 345 million was primarily a result of 399 million spent in 2009 to repurchase 21 million shares of treasury stock at an average price of 1928 per share the company did not repurchase any stock in 2010 also contributing to the change were additional proceeds of 76 million in 2010 from the exercise of stock options partially offset by an 117 million increase in principal payments on longterm debt in 2010 as compared to 2009 

the company’s term loan includes covenants related to the consolidated leverage ratio and the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio as well as certain restrictions on additional investments and indebtedness as of december 31 2010 the company is in compliance with all financial covenants as stated in the credit agreement 

financing activities used cash of 641 million for the year ended december 31 2009 as compared with cash provided of 2178 million for the year ended december 31 2008 this change of 2818 million was primarily a result of 3550 million in 2008 borrowings associated with the acquisition of ansoft in addition 399 million was spent during 2009 to repurchase 21 million shares of treasury stock at an average price of 1928 per share as compared to 100 million spent during 2008 to repurchase 368000 shares of treasury stock at an average price of 2717 per share these amounts were partially offset by an 816 million decrease in principal payments on longterm debt in 2009 as compared to 2008 

during the year ended december 31 2010 the company did not repurchase any stock during the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 the company spent 399 million and 100 million respectively on stock repurchases as of december 31 2010 13 million shares remain authorized for repurchase under the company’s stock repurchase program although the company has repurchased stock during the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 it may or may not do so in future periods 

the company believes that existing cash and cash equivalent balances of 4725 million together with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet the company’s working capital capital expenditure and debt service requirements through the next twelve months the company’s cash requirements in the future may also be financed through additional equity or debt financings there can be no assurance that such financings can be obtained on favorable terms if at all 

the company continues to generate positive cash flows from operating activities and believes that the best use of its excess cash is to repay its longterm debt to invest in the business and under certain favorable conditions to repurchase stock additionally the company has in the past and expects in the future to acquire or make investments in complementary companies products services and technologies any future acquisitions may be funded by available cash and investments cash generated from operations existing or additional credit facilities or from the issuance of additional securities 

the company has a 42 million line of credit available on a purchase card 

  

  

in addition to the adverse impact on 2010 operating cash flows of approximately 551 million that is discussed above the merger of the company’s japan subsidiaries is expected to favorably impact the company’s cash flow from operations in future periods as follows 

 

 offbalance sheet arrangements 

the company does not have any special purpose entities or offbalance sheet financing 

  

contractual obligations 

the company’s significant contractual obligations as of december 31 2010 are summarized below 

 

  

         

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the company believes that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 

revenue is derived principally from the licensing of computer software products and from related maintenance contracts revenue from perpetual licenses is classified as license revenue and is recognized upon delivery of the licensed product and the utility that enables the customer to access authorization keys provided that acceptance has occurred and a signed contractual obligation has been received the price is fixed and determinable and collectibility of the receivable is probable the company determines the fair value of postcontract customer support “pcs” sold together with perpetual licenses based on the contractual renewal rate for pcs when sold on a standalone basis revenue from pcs contracts is classified as maintenance and service revenue and is recognized ratably over the term of the contract 

revenue for software lease licenses is classified as license revenue and is recognized over the period of the lease contract typically the company’s software leases include pcs which due to the short term principally one year or less of the company’s software lease licenses cannot be separated from lease revenue for accounting purposes as a result both the lease license and pcs are recognized ratably over the lease period due to the shortterm nature of the software lease licenses and the frequency with which the company provides major product upgrades typically 12–18 months the company does not believe that a significant portion of the fee paid under the arrangement is attributable to the pcs component of the arrangement and as a result includes the revenue for the entire arrangement within software license revenue in the consolidated statements of income 

revenue from training support and other services is recognized as the services are performed the company applies the specific performance method to contracts in which the service consists of a single act such as providing a training class to a customer and the proportional performance method to other service contracts that are longer in duration and often include multiple acts for example both training and consulting in applying the proportional performance method the company typically utilizes outputbased estimates for services with contractual billing arrangements that are not based on time and materials and estimates output based on the total tasks completed as compared to the total tasks required for each work contract inputbased estimates are utilized for services that involve general consultations with contractual billing arrangements based on time and materials utilizing direct labor as the input measure 

the company also executes arrangements through channel partners in which the channel partners are authorized to market and distribute the company’s software products to end users of the company’s products and services in specified territories in sales facilitated by channel partners the channel partner bears the risk of collection from the end user customer the company recognizes revenue from transactions with channel partners when the channel partner submits a written purchase commitment collectibility from the channel partner is probable a signed license agreement is received from the end user customer and delivery has occurred provided that all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied revenue from channel partner transactions is the amount remitted to the company by the channel partners this amount includes a fee for pcs that is compensation for providing technical enhancements and the second level of technical support to the end user which is based on the contractual renewal rate in the end user customer’s license agreement and is recognized over the period that pcs is to be provided the company does not offer right of return product rotation or price protection to any of its channel partners 

nonincome related taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are recorded on the balance sheet as accounts receivable and accrued expenses the collection and payment of these amounts are reported on a net basis in the consolidated statements of income and do not impact reported revenues or expenses 

the company warrants to its customers that its software will substantially perform as specified in the company’s most current user manuals the company has not experienced significant claims related to software 

  

warranties beyond the scope of maintenance support which the company is already obligated to provide and consequently the company has not established reserves for warranty obligations 

the company’s agreements with its customers generally require it to indemnify the customer against claims that the company’s software infringes thirdparty patent copyright trademark or other proprietary rights such indemnification obligations are generally limited in a variety of industrystandard respects including the company’s right to replace an infringing product as of december 31 2010 the company had not experienced any losses related to these indemnification obligations and no claims with respect thereto were outstanding the company does not expect significant claims related to these indemnification obligations and consequently the company has not established any related reserves 

the company makes judgments as to its ability to collect outstanding receivables and provides allowances for a portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices from both value and delinquency perspectives for those invoices not specifically reviewed provisions are provided at differing rates based upon the age of the receivable and the geographical area of origin in determining these percentages the company considers its historical collection experience and current economic trends in the customer’s industry and geographic region if the historical data used to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and future results of operations could be materially affected 

the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period of the enactment date 

the company records net deferred tax assets to the extent it believes these assets will more likely than not be realized in making such determination the company considers all available positive and negative evidence including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and recent financial operations in the event the company determines that it would be able to realize deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be recorded that would reduce the provision for income taxes 

tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a more likely than not threshold otherwise these tax benefits are recorded when a tax position has been effectively settled which means that the statute of limitations has expired or the appropriate taxing authority has completed their examination even though the statute of limitations remains open the company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the income tax expense line in the accompanying consolidated statements of income accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheet 

the company tests goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment at least annually by comparing the fair value of each asset or in the case of goodwill the company’s reporting unit to its carrying value fair value is estimated using the discounted cash flow and other valuation methodologies in preparing the estimate of fair value the company relies on a number of factors including historical operating results business plans anticipated future cash flows economic projections and other market data because there are inherent uncertainties involved in these factors the company’s estimates of fair value are imprecise and the resulting carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets may be misstated when the company assigns a fair value to a trademark it also estimates whether it has a finite or indefinite life thus impacting whether the value is 

amortized or not events such as product and naming strategy changes can occur whereby the company may 

  

reconsider the life whether finite or indefinite resulting in changes to amortization expense amortization periods may also be reconsidered for identifiable intangible assets with finite lives 

the company tested the value of its reporting unit for impairment on january 1 2010 as of this date the fair value of the company’s reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying value the key assumptions utilized in determining the fair value of the company’s reporting unit are revenue growth rates growth rates of cash expenditures and related operating margin percentages income tax rates and factors that influence the company’s weighted average cost of capital including interest rates the ratio of the company’s debt capital to its total capital and the company’s systematic risk or beta 

of the preceding factors the company’s reporting unit fair value is most sensitive to changes in revenue growth rate estimates factors that could adversely affect the company’s revenue growth rates include adverse economic conditions in certain geographies or industries especially key industrial and electronics industries enhanced competition and related pricing pressures integration issues associated with acquisitions strengthening of the us dollar or other adverse foreign currency fluctuations reduced renewal rates for the company’s annual lease and maintenance contracts and the company’s ability to attract and retain key personnel any of these factors individually or in combination could cause the company’s growth rates to decline over a defined period of time the company has demonstrated an ability in the past to adjust its cost structure through reductions in discretionary spending delayed hiring or workforce reductions when faced with periods of reduced revenue growth if adverse conditions would persist over a longer period of time and would cause a revision to the company’s longterm revenue growth rate projections without a similar cost reduction response or if other factors would occur that would result in a similar growth rate revision or a material revision to the other inputs to reporting unit fair value it could cause the fair value of the company’s reporting unit to fall below its carrying value potentially resulting in an impairment of goodwill 

the company is involved in various investigations claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of its business activities the company reviews the status of these matters assesses its financial exposure and records a related accrual if the potential loss from an investigation claim or legal proceeding is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable significant judgment is involved in the determination of probability and in the determination of whether an exposure is reasonably estimable as a result of the uncertainties involved in making these estimates the company may have to revise its estimates as facts and circumstances change the revision of these estimates could have a material impact on the company’s financial position and results of operations 

the company grants options to purchase its common stock to employees and directors under the company’s stock option plan eligible employees can also purchase shares of the company’s common stock at a discount under the company’s employee stock purchase plan the benefits provided under these plans are sharebased payments subject to the provisions of sharebased payment accounting guidance the company uses the fair value method to apply the provisions of sharebased payment accounting guidance sharebased compensation expense for 2010 2009 and 2008 was 190 million 132 million and 118 million respectively as of december 31 2010 total unrecognized estimated compensation expense related to unvested stock options granted prior to that date was 444 million which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 20 years net stock options after forfeitures and cancellations granted during 2010 2009 and 2008 represented 126 134 and 126 respectively of outstanding shares as of the beginning of each fiscal year net stock options after forfeitures and cancellations granted during 2010 2009 and 2008 represented 124 133 and 110 respectively of outstanding shares as of the end of each fiscal year in addition during 2008 the company issued 195 million options pursuant to assumed stock options associated with the acquisition of ansoft representing 249 and 218 of outstanding shares as of the beginning and end of the 2008 fiscal year respectively of the options issued associated with the acquisition 194 million were fully vested as of the acquisition date 

the value of each sharebased award was estimated on the date of grant using the blackscholes option pricing model “blackscholes model” the determination of the fair value of sharebased payment awards on 

  

the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by the company’s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables these variables include the company’s expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors riskfree interest rates and expected dividends the table below presents the assumptions used in calculating the stock option compensation expense recorded within the company’s consolidated statements of income for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 the interest rates used were determined by using the fiveyear treasury note yield on the date of grant 

 

 the company issues both nonqualified and incentive stock options however incentive stock options comprise a significant portion of outstanding stock options the tax benefits associated with incentive stock options are unpredictable as they are predicated upon an award recipient triggering an event that disqualifies the award and that then results in a tax deduction to the company sharebased payment accounting guidance requires that these tax benefits be recorded at the time of the triggering event the triggering events for each option holder are not easily projected in order to estimate the tax benefits related to incentive stock options the company makes many assumptions and estimates including the number of incentive stock options that will be exercised during the period by us employees the number of incentive stock options that will be disqualified during the period and the fair market value of the company’s stock price on the exercise dates each of these items is subject to significant uncertainty additionally a significant portion of the tax benefits related to disqualified incentive stock options is accounted for as an increase to equity additional paidin capital rather than as a reduction in income tax expense although all such benefits continue to be realized through the company’s tax filings this accounting treatment has the effect of increasing tax expense and reducing net income for example the company realized a tax benefit of 73 million during the year ended december 31 2010 related to disqualified dispositions of incentive stock options however only 828000 of such amount was recorded as a reduction in income tax expense 

in the first quarter of 2010 the company granted 80500 performancebased restricted stock units under the terms of the ansys inc longterm incentive plan vesting of the full award or a portion thereof is based on the company’s performance as measured by total shareholder return relative to the median percentage appreciation of the nasdaq composite index over a specified measurement period subject to each participant’s continued employment with the company through the conclusion of the measurement period the measurement period for the restricted stock units granted in the first quarter of 2010 is the threeyear period from january 1 2010 through december 31 2012 each restricted stock unit relates to one share of the company’s common stock the value of the restricted stock units was estimated on the grant date to be 2500 using a monte carlo lattice pricing model the determination of the fair value of the awards was affected by the grant date and a number of variables each of which has been identified in the chart below sharebased compensation expense based on the fair value of the award is being recorded from the grant date through the conclusion of the threeyear measurement period 

 

   

  

in addition the company grants deferred stock units to nonaffiliate independent directors which are rights to receive shares of common stock upon termination of service as a director the deferred stock units are issued in arrears and vest immediately as of december 31 2010 56620 deferred stock units have been earned with the underlying shares remaining unissued until the service termination of the respective director owners of this amount 16800 were earned during the year ended december 31 2010 

if factors change and the company employs different assumptions in the application of sharebased payment accounting guidance in future periods the compensation expense that the company will record may differ significantly from what the company has recorded in the current period therefore it is important for investors to be aware of the high degree of subjectivity involved when using option pricing models to estimate sharebased compensation option pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions are fully transferable and do not cause dilution because the company’s sharebased payments have characteristics significantly different from those of freely traded options and because changes in the input assumptions can materially affect the company’s estimates of fair values in the company’s opinion existing valuation models may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of the company’s sharebased compensation consequently there is a risk that the company’s estimates of the fair values of the company’s sharebased compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise expiration early termination or forfeiture of those sharebased payments in the future certain sharebased payments such as employee stock options may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in the company’s financial statements alternatively value may be realized from these instruments that is significantly in excess of the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in the company’s financial statements there is currently no marketbased mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models nor is there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values although the fair value of employee sharebased awards is determined in accordance with sharebased payment accounting guidance using an option pricing model that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyerseller market transaction 

estimates of sharebased compensation expenses are significant to the company’s financial statements but these expenses are based on the aforementioned option valuation model and will never result in the payment of cash by the company for this reason and because the company does not view sharebased compensation as related to its operational performance the board of directors and management exclude estimated sharebased compensation expense when evaluating the company’s underlying business performance

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend interest income rate risk  changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest income that is generated from the company’s cash and shortterm investments for the year ended december 31 2010 total interest income was 19 million cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of highly liquid investments such as money market mutual funds and deposits held at major banks 

interest expense rate risk  in connection with the fluent acquisition the company entered into two credit agreements as of may 1 2006 with variable interest rates and total borrowings of 198 million the amounts borrowed with respect to one of the credit agreements were paid in full as of december 31 2006 the amounts borrowed with respect to the second credit agreement were paid in full as of june 30 2008 in connection with the ansoft acquisition the company entered into a 3550 million term loan with variable interest rates as of july 31 2008 the term loan is scheduled to mature on july 31 2013 and provides for tiered pricing with the initial rate at the prime rate  050 or the libor rate  150 with step downs permitted after the initial six months under the credit agreement down to a flat prime rate or the libor rate  075 such tiered pricing is determined by the company’s consolidated leverage ratio the credit agreement includes quarterly financial covenants requiring the company to maintain certain financial ratios and as is customary for facilities of this type certain events of default that permit the acceleration of the loan borrowings outstanding under this facility totaled 1594 million as of december 31 2010 

the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement in order to hedge a portion of each of the first eight forecasted quarterly variable rate interest payments on the company’s term loan under the swap agreement the company received the variable threemonth libor rate required under its term loan and paid a fixed libor interest rate of 332 on the notional amount the initial notional amount of 3000 million was amortized equally at an amount of 375 million per quarter over eight quarters through june 30 2010 the interest rate swap agreement terminated on june 30 2010 

for the year ended december 31 2010 the company recorded interest expense related to the term loan at a weighted average interest rate of 153 if the company did not enter into the interest rate swap agreement the weighted average interest rate would have been 108 for the year ended december 31 2009 the company recorded interest expense related to the term loan at a weighted average interest rate of 341 if the company did not enter into the interest rate swap agreement the weighted average interest rate would have been 188 for the year ended december 31 2008 the company recorded interest expense related to the term loans at a weighted average interest rate of 472 if the company did not enter into the interest rate swap agreement the weighted average interest rate would have been 473 the interest expense on the term loans and amortization related to debt financing costs were as follows 

 

 the interest rate on the outstanding term loan balance of 1594 million is set for the quarter ending march 31 2011 at 105 which is based on the libor rate  075 as of december 31 2010 the fair value of the debt approximated the recorded value 

  

based on the effective interest rates and remaining outstanding borrowings at december 31 2010 a 050 increase in interest rates would not impact the company’s interest expense for the quarter ending march 31 2011 based on the effective interest rates and remaining outstanding borrowings at december 31 2010 assuming contractual quarterly principal payments are made a 050 increase in interest rates would increase the company’s interest expense by approximately 600000 for the year ending december 31 2011 

foreign currency transaction risk  as the company continues to expand its business presence in international regions the portion of its revenue expenses cash accounts receivable and payment obligations denominated in foreign currencies continues to increase as a result changes in currency exchange rates will affect the company’s financial position results of operations and cash flows the company is most impacted by movements in and among the british pound euro japanese yen canadian dollar indian rupee swedish krona chinese renminbi korean won taiwan dollar and the us dollar 

with respect to revenue on average for the year ended december 31 2010 the us dollar was approximately 01 stronger when measured against the company’s primary foreign currencies than for the year ended december 31 2009 the us dollar strengthened against the british pound and euro while it weakened against the japanese yen korean won taiwan dollar chinese renminbi swedish krona indian rupee and canadian dollar the net overall strengthening resulted in decreased revenue and operating income during 2010 as compared with 2009 of approximately 200000 and 600000 respectively 

the company’s operating results are favorably impacted when the us dollar weakens against the company’s primary foreign currencies and are adversely impacted when the us dollar strengthens against the company’s primary foreign currencies had the activity for the year ended december 31 2010 been recorded at the december 31 2010 spot rates for each subsidiary’s functional currency the revenue and operating income for the year would have increased by 90 million and 51 million respectively 

the most significant currency impacts on revenue and operating income were primarily attributable to us dollar exchange rate changes against the euro british pound and japanese yen as reflected in the charts below 

 

  

 other risks based on the nature of the company’s business it has no direct exposure to commodity price risk

competition 

the company believes that the principal factors affecting sales of its software include ease of use breadth and depth of functionality flexibility quality ease of integration with other software systems file compatibility across computer platforms range of supported computer platforms performance price and total cost of ownership customer service and support company reputation and financial viability and effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts 

the company continues to experience intense competition across all markets for its products and services some of the company’s current and possible future competitors have greater financial technical marketing and other resources than the company and some have well established relationships with current and potential customers of the company the company’s current and possible future competitors also include firms that have or may in the future elect to compete by means of open source licensing these competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes price reductions andor increased operating costs and could result in lower revenues margins and net income 

proprietary rights and licenses 

the company regards its software as proprietary and relies on a combination of trade secret copyright patent and trademark laws license agreements nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect its proprietary rights in its products the company distributes its software products under 

  

software license agreements that grant customers nonexclusive licenses for the use of the company’s products which are typically nontransferable license agreements for the company’s products are directly between the company and end users use of the licensed software product is restricted to specified sites unless the customer obtains a multisite license for its use of the software product software security measures are also employed to prevent unauthorized use of the company’s software products and the licensed software is subject to terms and conditions prohibiting unauthorized reproduction customers may purchase a perpetual license of the technology with the right to annually purchase ongoing maintenance technical support and updates or may lease the product on a fixed term basis for a fee that includes the license maintenance technical support and upgrades 

the company licenses its software products utilizing a combination of webbased and hard copy license terms and forms for certain software products the company primarily relies on “clickwrapped” licenses the enforceability of these types of agreements under the laws of some jurisdictions is uncertain 

the company also seeks to protect the source code of its software as a trade secret and as unpublished copyrighted work the company has obtained federal trademark registration protection for ansys ansys workbench autodyn cfx fluent maxwell and other marks in the us and in foreign countries additionally the company was awarded a patent by the us patent and trademark office for its webbased reporting technology 

employees of the company have signed agreements under which they have agreed not to disclose trade secrets or confidential information and where legally permitted that restrict engagement in or connection with any business that is competitive with the company anywhere in the world while employed by the company and in some cases for specified periods thereafter and that any products or technology created by them during their term of employment are the property of the company in addition the company requires all channel partners to enter into agreements not to disclose the company’s trade secrets and other proprietary information 

despite these precautions there can be no assurance that misappropriation of the company’s technology and proprietary information will not occur further there can be no assurance that copyright trademark patent and trade secret protection will be available for the company’s products in certain countries or that restrictions on the ability of employees and channel partners to engage in activities competitive with the company will be enforceable 

the software development industry is characterized by rapid technological change therefore the company believes that factors such as the technological and creative skills of its personnel new product developments frequent product enhancements name recognition and reliable product maintenance are also important to establishing and maintaining technology leadership in addition to the various legal protections of its technology that may be available 

the company does not believe that any of its products infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties there can be no assurance however that third parties will not claim such infringement by the company or its licensors or licensees with respect to current or future products the company expects that software suppliers will increasingly be subject to the risk of such claims as the number of products and suppliers continues to expand and the functionality of products continues to increase any such claims with or without merit could be time consuming result in costly litigation cause product shipment delays or require the company to enter into royalty or licensing agreements such royalty or licensing agreements if required may not be available on terms acceptable to the company 

seasonal variations 

the company’s business has experienced seasonality including quarterly reductions in software sales resulting from the slowdown during the summer months particularly in europe as well as from the seasonal purchasing and budgeting patterns of the company’s global customers the company’s revenue and margins are typically highest in the fourth quarter 

  

backlog 

the company generally ships its products within 30 days after acceptance of an order and execution of a software license agreement accordingly the company does not believe that its backlog at any particular point in time is indicative of future sales levels 

employees 

as of december 31 2009 the company and its subsidiaries had approximately 1600 fulltime employees at that date there were also contract personnel and coop students providing ongoing development services and technical support the company believes that its relationship with its employees is good

 item 1a   risk factors tableend information provided by the company or its spokespersons including information contained in this annual report on form 10k may from time to time contain forwardlooking statements concerning projected financial performance market and industry sector growth product development and commercialization or other aspects of future operations such statements will be based on the assumptions and expectations of the company’s management at the time such statements are made the company cautions investors that its performance and therefore any forwardlooking statement is subject to risks and uncertainties various important factors including but not limited to the following may cause the company’s future results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statement 

adverse conditions in the global economy and disruption in financial markets the financial markets in the united states europe and asia continue to experience disruption including among other things volatility in security prices diminished liquidity and credit availability rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others while currently these conditions have not impaired the company’s ability to access credit markets and finance operations there can be no assurance that there will not be a further deterioration in financial markets and confidence in major economies the company is impacted by these economic developments both domestically and globally in that the current tightening of credit in financial markets adversely affects the ability of its customers and suppliers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations and could result in a decrease in orders for the company’s products and services these economic conditions may negatively impact the company as some of its customers defer purchasing decisions thereby lengthening the company’s sales cycles in addition certain of the company’s customers’ budgets may be constrained and they may be unable to purchase our products at the same level the company’s customers’ ability to pay for the company’s products and services may also be impaired which may lead to an increase in the company’s allowance for doubtful accounts and writeoffs of accounts receivable the company is unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the adverse economic conditions in the us and other countries should these economic conditions result in the company not meeting its revenue growth objectives the company’s operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

decline in customers’ business the company’s sales are based significantly on end user demand for products in key industrial sectors many of these sectors periodically experience economic declines which may be exacerbated by other economic factors including the current global economic disruptions these factors may 

  

adversely affect the company’s business by extending sales cycles and reducing revenue these economic factors may cause the company’s customers to reduce the size of their workforce or cut back on operations and may lead to a reduction in license renewals or ongoing maintenance contracts with the company the company’s customers may also request discounts or extended payment terms on new products or seek to extend payment terms on existing contracts all of which may cause fluctuations in the company’s future operating results the company may not be able to adjust its operating expenses to offset such fluctuations because a substantial portion of the company’s operating expenses is related to personnel facilities and marketing programs the level of personnel and related expenses may not be able to be adjusted quickly and is based in significant part on the company’s expectation for future revenue the company’s customers have also been decreasing the size of foregoing or delaying new investments in the company’s products as a result of the global economic disruptions and the company is experiencing increased pricing pressure in certain products and geographic areas accordingly the company’s license revenue during the year ended december 31 2009 was less than license revenue during the year ended december 31 2008 if the company’s customers further reduce delay or decide to forego investments in the company’s products and downward pressure on prices continues the company’s license revenue may be adversely affected 

risks associated with international activities a majority of the company’s business comes from outside the united states and the company has customers that supply a wide spectrum of goods and services in virtually all of the world’s major economic regions as the company continues to expand its sales presence in international regions the portion of its revenue expenses cash accounts receivable and payment obligations denominated in foreign currencies continues to increase the company’s revenues and operating results are adversely affected when the us dollar strengthens relative to other currencies and are positively affected when the us dollar weakens as a result changes in currency exchange rates will affect the company’s financial position results of operations and cash flows in the event that there are economic declines in countries in which the company conducts transactions the resulting changes in currency exchange rates may from time to time affect the company’s financial position results of operations and cash flows the company is most impacted by movements in and among the british pound euro japanese yen canadian dollar indian rupee swedish krona chinese renminbi korean won taiwan dollar and the us dollar the company seeks to reduce these risks primarily through its normal operating and treasury activities but there can be no assurances it will be successful in reducing these risks 

additionally the company’s ansoft business has had lower revenue than originally anticipated at the time of the company’s acquisition of ansoft primarily as a result of the ongoing global economic downturn having a disproportionate effect on the industries and geographic areas from which ansoft derives a substantial portion of its revenue if these international business conditions continue to exist the company’s revenue net income and earnings per share growth may be negatively impacted 

additional risks inherent in the company’s international business activities include imposition of government controls export license requirements restrictions on the export of critical technology products and services political and economic instability trade restrictions changes in tariffs and taxes difficulties in staffing and managing international operations longer accounts receivable payment cycles and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations effective patent copyright trademark and trade secret protection may not be available in every foreign country in which the company sells its products and services the company’s business financial position results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks 

stock market and stock price volatility market prices for securities of software companies have generally been volatile in particular the market price of the company’s common stock has been and may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations as a result of factors affecting the company the software industry or the securities markets in general such factors include but are not limited to declines in trading price that may be triggered by the company’s failure to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors in connection with recent volatility in global economic conditions the prices of equity securities including the price of the 

  

company’s common stock experienced price and volume volatility in many cases disproportionate to the underlying operating performance of the affected companies the company’s common stock was at its lowest closing price during the year ended december 31 2009 on march 9 2009 at a price of 1806 per share as of december 31 2009 the company’s common stock closed at 4346 per share moreover the trading price could be subject to additional fluctuations in response to quartertoquarter variations in the company’s operating results material announcements made by the company or its competitors conditions in the financial markets or the software industry generally or other events and factors many of which are beyond the company’s control 

rapidly changing technology new products risk of product defects the company operates in an industry generally characterized by rapidly changing technology and frequent new product introductions which can render existing products obsolete or unmarketable a major factor in the company’s future success will be its ability to anticipate technological changes and to develop and introduce in a timely manner enhancements to its existing products products acquired in acquisitions and new products to meet those changes if the company is unable to introduce new products and to respond quickly to industry changes its business financial position results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

the introduction and marketing of new or enhanced products require the company to manage the transition from existing products in order to minimize disruption in customer purchasing patterns there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing and marketing on a timely basis new products or product enhancements that its new products will adequately address the changing needs of the marketplace or that it will successfully manage the transition from existing products software products as complex as those offered by the company may contain undetected errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are released and the likelihood of errors is increased as a result of the company’s commitment to accelerating the frequency of its product releases there can be no assurance that errors will not be found in any new or enhanced products after commencement of commercial shipments certain of these products require a higher level of sales and support expertise the ability of the company’s sales channel particularly the indirect channel to obtain this expertise and to sell the new product offerings effectively could have an adverse impact on the company’s sales in future periods any of these problems may result in the loss of or delay in customer acceptance diversion of development resources damage to the company’s reputation or increased service and warranty costs any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

dependence on channel partners the company continues to distribute a meaningful portion of its products through its global network of independent regional channel partners the channel partners sell the company’s software products to new and existing customers expand installations within the existing customer base offer consulting services and provide the first line of technical support consequently in certain geographies the company is highly dependent upon the efforts of the channel partners difficulties in ongoing relationships with channel partners such as failure to meet performance criteria or to promote the company’s products as aggressively as the company expects and differences in the handling of customer relationships could adversely affect the company’s performance additionally the loss of any major channel partner for any reason including a channel partner’s decision to sell competing products rather than the company’s products could have a material adverse effect on the company moreover the company’s future success will depend substantially on the ability and willingness of its channel partners to continue to dedicate the resources necessary to promote the company’s portfolio of products and to support a larger installed base of the company’s products if the channel partners are unable or unwilling to do so the company may be unable to sustain revenue growth 

during times of significant fluctuations in world currencies certain channel partners may have solvency issues to the extent that effective hedge transactions are not employed or there is not sufficient working capital in particular if the us dollar strengthens relative to other currencies certain channel partners who pay the company in us dollars may have trouble paying the company on time or may have trouble distributing the company’s products due to the impact of the currency exchange fluctuation on such channel partner’s cash flows this may impact the company’s ability to distribute its products into certain regions and markets and may have an adverse effect on the company’s results of operations and cash flows 

  

competition the company continues to experience intense competition across all markets for its products and services some of the company’s current and possible future competitors have greater financial technical marketing and other resources than the company and some have well established relationships with current and potential customers of the company the company’s current and possible future competitors also include firms that have or may in the future elect to compete by means of open source licensing these competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes price reductions andor increased operating costs and could result in lower revenues margins and net income 

dependence on senior management and key technical personnel the company’s success depends upon the continued services of the company’s senior executives key technical employees and other employees each of the company’s executive officers key technical personnel and other employees could terminate his or her relationship with the company at any time the loss of any of the company’s senior executives might significantly delay or prevent the achievement of the company’s business objectives and could materially harm the company’s business and customer relationships in addition because of the highly technical nature of the company’s products the loss of any significant number of existing engineering and development personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business and operating results 

dependence on proprietary technology the company’s success is highly dependent upon its proprietary technology the company generally relies on contracts and the laws of copyright and trade secrets to protect its technology the company maintains a trade secrets program enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees and channel partners and limits access to and distribution of its software documentation and other proprietary information there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company to protect its proprietary technology will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of its technology by third parties or that third parties will not be able to develop similar technology independently although the company is not aware that any of its technology infringes upon the rights of third parties there can be no assurance that other parties will not assert technology infringement claims against the company or that if asserted such claims will not prevail 

reliance on perpetual licenses although the company has historically maintained stable recurring revenue from the sale of software lease licenses software maintenance subscriptions and third party royalties it also has relied on sales of perpetual licenses that involve payment of a single upfront fee and that are more typical in the computer software industry additionally the acquisition of ansoft resulted in an increase in the company’s perpetual license revenue as compared to its total revenue while revenue generated from software lease licenses software maintenance subscriptions and third party royalties currently represents a portion of the company’s revenue to the extent that perpetual license revenue continues to represent a significant percentage of total revenue the company’s revenue in any period will depend increasingly on sales completed during that period 

risks associated with acquisitions historically the company has consummated acquisitions in order to support the company’s longterm strategic direction accelerate innovation provide increased capabilities to its existing products supply new products and services expand its customer base and enhance its distribution channels in the future the company may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or if suitable candidates are identified the company may not be able to complete the business combination on commercially acceptable terms the process of exploring and pursuing acquisition opportunities may result in devotion of significant management and financial resources 

even if the company is able to consummate acquisitions that it believes will be successful such transactions present many risks significant risks to such acquisitions include among others failing to achieve anticipated synergies and revenue increases difficulty incorporating and integrating the acquired technologies or products with the company’s existing product lines difficulty in coordinating establishing or expanding sales distribution and marketing functions as necessary disruption of the company’s ongoing business and diversion of management’s attention to transition or integration issues unanticipated and unknown liabilities the loss of key employees customers partners and channel partners of the company or of the acquired company and 

  

difficulties implementing and maintaining sufficient controls policies and procedures over the systems products and processes of the acquired company if the company does not achieve the anticipated benefits of its acquisitions as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by the company’s management and financial or industry analysts or if others do not perceive the same benefits of the acquisition as the company there could be a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in addition for companies acquired limited experience will exist for several quarters following the acquisition relating to how the acquired company’s sales pipelines will convert into sales or revenues and the conversion rate postacquisition may be quite different than the historical conversion rate because a substantial portion of the company’s sales are completed in the latter part of a quarter and its cost structure is largely fixed in the short term revenue shortfalls may have a negative impact on the company’s profitability a delay in a small number of large new software license transactions could cause the company’s quarterly software license revenues to fall significantly short of its predictions 

disruption of operations or infrastructure failures a significant portion of the company’s software development personnel source code and computer equipment is located at operating facilities in the united states canada india and throughout europe the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unforeseen catastrophe at any of these facilities could cause interruptions in the company’s operations services and product development activities additionally if the company experiences problems that impair its business infrastructure such as a computer virus telephone system failure or an intentional disruption of its information technology systems by a third party these interruptions could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial position results of operations cash flows and the ability to meet financial reporting timelines further because the company’s sales are not generally linear during any quarterly period the potential adverse effects resulting from any of the events described above or any other disruption of the company’s business could be accentuated if it occurs close to the end of a fiscal quarter 

sales forecasts the company makes many operational and strategic decisions based upon short and longterm sales forecasts the company’s sales personnel continually monitor the status of all proposals including the estimated closing date and the value of the sale in order to forecast quarterly sales these forecasts are subject to significant estimation and are impacted by many external factors including global economic conditions and the performance of the company’s customers a variation in actual sales activity from that forecasted could cause the company to plan or to budget incorrectly and therefore could adversely affect the company’s business financial position results of operations and cash flows the company’s management team forecasts macroeconomic trends and developments and integrates them through longrange planning into budgets research and development strategies and a wide variety of general management duties the current global economic conditions and the effect those conditions and the related disruptions in global credit markets have on the company’s customers may have a significant impact on the accuracy of the company’s sales forecasts these conditions may increase the likelihood or the magnitude of variations between actual sales activity and the company’s sales forecasts and as a result the company’s performance may be hindered because of a failure to properly match corporate strategy with economic conditions this in turn may adversely affect the company’s business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

income tax estimates the company makes significant estimates in determining its worldwide income tax provision these estimates involve complex tax regulations in a number of jurisdictions across the company’s global operations and are subject to many transactions and calculations in which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain the final outcome of tax matters could be different than the estimates reflected in the historical income tax provision and related accruals such differences could have a material impact on income tax expense and net income in the periods in which such determinations are made 

the amount of income tax paid by the company is subject to ongoing audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities these audits often result in proposed assessments the company’s estimate for liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions is highly judgmental and actual future results may result in favorable or unfavorable 

  

adjustments to the company’s estimated tax liabilities including estimates for uncertain tax positions in the period the assessments are made or resolved audits are closed or when statutes of limitations on potential assessments expire as a result the company’s effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis 

recently the internal revenue service announced its intention to require taxpayers with assets over 100 million and financial statements prepared under income tax accounting guidance to disclose information with respect to uncertain tax positions the proposed disclosure would require a concise description of each uncertain position as well as the maximum potential federal tax liability attributable to each uncertain tax position if the new disclosure requirement is implemented it is anticipated that it will apply to 2010 tax returns 

the company allocates a portion of its purchase price to goodwill and intangible assets impairment charges associated with goodwill are generally not tax deductible and will result in an increased effective income tax rate in the period the impairment is recorded the company has recorded significant deferred tax liabilities related to acquired intangible assets that are not deductible for tax purposes these deferred tax liabilities are based on future statutory tax rates in the locations in which the intangible assets are recorded any future changes in statutory tax rates would be recorded as an adjustment to the deferred tax liabilities in the period the change is announced and could have a material impact on the company’s effective tax rate during that period 

periodic reorganization of sales force the company relies heavily on its direct sales force from time to time the company reorganizes and makes adjustments to its sales force in response to such factors as management changes performance issues market opportunities and other considerations these changes may result in a temporary lack of sales production and may adversely impact revenue in future quarters there can be no assurance that the company will not restructure its sales force in future periods or that the transition issues associated with such a restructuring will not recur 

regulatory compliance like all other public companies the company is subject to the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission “sec” including those that require the company to report on and receive an attestation from its independent registered public accounting firm regarding the company’s internal control over financial reporting compliance with these requirements causes the company to incur additional expenses and causes management to divert time from the daytoday operations of the company while the company anticipates being able to fully comply with these requirements if it is not able to comply with the sarbanesoxley reporting or attestation requirements relating to internal control over financial reporting the company may be subject to sanctions by the sec or nasdaq such sanctions could divert the attention of the company’s management from implementing its business plan and could have an adverse effect on the company’s business and results of operations 

as the company’s stock is listed on the nasdaq global select market the company is subject to the ongoing financial and corporate governance requirements of nasdaq while the company anticipates being able to fully comply with these requirements if it is not able to comply the company’s name may be published on nasdaq’s daily noncompliant companies list until nasdaq determines that it has regained compliance or the company no longer trades on nasdaq if the company were unable to return to compliance with the governance requirements of nasdaq the company may be delisted from the nasdaq global select market which could have an adverse effect on the company’s ability to raise additional capital 

governmental revenue sources the company’s sales to the united states government must comply with the regulations set forth in the federal acquisition regulations failure to comply with these regulations could result in penalties being assessed against the company or an order preventing the company from making future sales to the united states government further the company’s international activities must comply with the export control laws of the united states the foreign corrupt practices act and a variety of other laws and regulations of the united states and other countries in which the company operates failure to comply with any of these laws and regulations could adversely affect the company’s business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

  

in certain circumstances the united states government state and local governments and their respective agencies and certain foreign governments may have the right to terminate these engagements at any time without cause the united states european union and certain other government contracts as well as the company’s state and local level contracts are subject to the approval of appropriations or funding authorizations certain of these contracts permit the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions including but not limited to termination of contracts refund of a portion of fees received forfeiture of profits suspension of payments fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business any of which could have an adverse effect on the company’s results of operations and cash flows 

risks associated with significant sales to existing customers a significant portion of the company’s sales include followon sales to existing customers that invest in the company’s broad suite of engineering simulation software and services if a significant number of current customers were to become dissatisfied with the company’s products and services or choose to license or utilize competitive offerings the company’s followon sales and recurring lease and maintenance revenues could be materially adversely impacted resulting in reduced revenue operating margins net income and cash flows 

contingencies the company is involved in various investigations claims and legal proceedings from time to time that arise in the ordinary course of its business activities including alleged infringement of intellectual property rights commercial disputes employment matters tax audits and other matters each of these matters is subject to various uncertainties and it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could in the future materially affect the company’s results of operations cash flows or financial position 

changes in existing financial accounting standards or taxation rules changes in existing accounting or taxation rules or practices new accounting pronouncements or taxation rules or varying interpretations of current accounting pronouncements or taxation practices could have a significant adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or the manner in which the company conducts its business 

changes in the company’s pricing models the intense competition the company faces in the sales of its products and services and general economic and business conditions can put pressure on the company to adjust its prices if company’s competitors offer deep discounts on certain products or services or develop products that the marketplace considers more valuable the company may need to lower prices or offer other favorable terms in order to compete successfully any such changes may reduce margins and could adversely affect operating results the company’s software license updates and product support fees are generally priced as a percentage of its net new software license fees the company’s competitors may offer lower percentage pricing on product updates and support which could put pressure on the company to further discount its new license prices 

any broadbased change to the company’s prices and pricing policies could cause new software license and service revenues to decline or be delayed as its sales force implements and its customers adjust to the new pricing policies some of the company’s competitors may bundle software products for promotional purposes or as a longterm pricing strategy or provide guarantees of prices and product implementations these practices could over time significantly constrain the prices that the company can charge for certain of its products if the company does not adapt its pricing models to reflect changes in customer use of its products or changes in customer demand the company’s new software license revenues could decrease additionally increased distribution of applications through application service providers including softwareasaservice providers may reduce the average price for the company’s products or adversely affect other sales of the company’s products reducing new software license revenues unless the company can offset price reductions with volume increases the increase in open source software distribution may also cause the company to adjust its pricing models 

renewal rates for annual lease and maintenance contracts a substantial portion of the company’s license and maintenance revenue is derived from annual lease and maintenance contracts these contracts are generally renewed on an annual basis and typically have a high rate of customer renewal in addition to the recurring revenue base associated with these contracts a majority of customers purchasing new perpetual 

  

licenses also purchase related annual maintenance contracts if the rate of renewal for these contracts is adversely affected by economic or other factors the company’s license and maintenance growth will be adversely affected over the term that the revenue for those contracts would have otherwise been recognized as a result the company’s business financial position results of operations and cash flows may also be adversely impacted during those periods

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend overview 

ansys inc’s hereafter the “company” or “ansys” results for the year ended december 31 2009 reflect a revenue increase of 81 as compared to the year ended december 31 2008 and basic and diluted earnings per share of 132 and 127 respectively these results were significantly impacted by the july 2008 acquisition of ansoft the company experienced higher revenues in 2009 from both the ansoft acquisition and from maintenance growth in the company’s other products these increases were partially offset by a decline in perpetual software license revenue and service revenue and an adverse impact on revenue from foreign currency fluctuations the revenue contribution from the ansoft business was lower for the year ended december 31 2009 than the company had expected at the time of the acquisition as compared to the company’s nonansoft business the ansoft business derives a higher percentage of its revenue from sales of perpetual licenses accordingly there tends to be higher volatility with respect to ansoft’s revenue performance in any quarter than for the nonansoft component of the company’s business which has a higher percentage of lease and maintenance revenue the unfavorable state of the global economy during the year ended december 31 2009 adversely affected the company’s ansoft revenues more significantly than the nonansoft revenues contributing significantly to the revenue underperformance as compared to the company’s expectations 

in 2009 the company incurred increased operating expenses associated with the ansoft business which was not acquired by the company until the third quarter of 2008 and decreased nonansoft operating expenses including salaries incentive compensation and headcountrelated costs incentive compensation was lower in 2009 due to a reduction in the company’s relative performance against internal sales and operating plan as compared to the 2008 performance the decrease in salaries and headcountrelated costs was a result of the decision by the company to reduce its global workforce by approximately 6 as part of the company’s ongoing effort to manage expenses and its overall cost structure the cost reductions were partially offset by 37 million in severance costs of which 28 million was paid in 2009 

also in connection with the acquisition of ansoft on july 31 2008 the company borrowed 3550 million and incurred interest expense including expenses associated with an interest rate swap agreement and loan amortization costs during the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 of 101 million and 93 million respectively as of december 31 2009 and 2008 remaining outstanding borrowings totaled 2251 million and 2790 million respectively 

during march 2009 the company repurchased 21 million shares of treasury stock for 399 million the company’s financial position includes 3438 million in cash and shortterm investments and working capital of 2487 million as of december 31 2009 

ansys develops and globally markets engineering simulation software and services widely used by engineers and designers across a broad spectrum of industries including aerospace automotive manufacturing electronics biomedical energy and defense headquartered at southpointe in canonsburg pennsylvania the company and its subsidiaries employ approximately 1600 people as of december 31 2009 and focus on the development of open and flexible solutions that enable users to analyze designs directly on the desktop providing a common platform for fast efficient and costconscious product development from design concept to finalstage testing and validation the company distributes its simulation technologies through a global network of independent channel partners and direct sales offices in strategic global locations it is the company’s intention to continue to maintain this mixed sales and distribution model 

the company licenses its technology to businesses educational institutions and governmental agencies growth in the company’s revenue is affected by the strength of global economies general business conditions currency exchange rate fluctuations customer budgetary constraints and the competitive position of the company’s products please see the subsections entitled “adverse conditions in the global economy and 

  

disruption in financial markets” “decline in customers’ business” and “risks associated with international activities” under item 1a—risk factors above for a complete discussion of how these factors might impact the company’s financial condition and operating results the company believes that the features functionality and integrated multiphysics capabilities of its software products are as strong as they have ever been however the software business is generally characterized by long sales cycles these long sales cycles increase the difficulty of predicting sales for any particular quarter the company makes many operational and strategic decisions based upon short and longterm sales forecasts which are impacted not only by these long sales cycles but by current global economic conditions as a result the company believes that its overall performance is best measured by fiscal year results rather than by quarterly results please see the subsection entitled “sales forecasts” under item 1a—risk factors above for a complete discussion of the potential impact of the company’s sales forecasts on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

the company’s management considers the intense competition and price pressure that it faces in the short and longterm by focusing on expanding the breadth depth ease of use and quality of the technologies features functionality and integrated multiphysics capabilities of its software products as compared to its competitors investing in research and development to develop new and innovative products and increase the capabilities of its existing products supplying new products and services focusing on customer needs training consultation and support and enhancing its distribution channels from time to time the company also considers acquisitions to supplement its global engineering talent product offerings and distribution channels

acquisitions 

on july 31 2008 the company completed its acquisition of ansoft a global provider of simulation software for highperformance electronic design under the terms of the merger agreement ansoft stockholders received 1625 in cash and 0431882 shares of ansys common stock for each outstanding ansoft share held on july 31 2008 ansys issued an aggregate of 1224 million shares of its common stock including 195 million shares pursuant to assumed stock options valued at approximately 4326 million based on the average closing market price on the two days preceding and the two days following the announcement of the acquisition and paid approximately 3873 million in cash the total purchase price of approximately 8238 million includes approximately 39 million in transaction fees the company used a combination of existing cash and proceeds from a 3550 million unsecured senior term loan credit facility to fund the transaction in addition to the 39 million in transactionrelated costs the company incurred financing costs of approximately 46 million related to the credit facility 

the operating results of ansoft have been included in the company’s consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition july 31 2008 the total purchase price was allocated to the foreign and domestic assets and liabilities of ansoft based upon management’s estimates of the fair market values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed the allocation included 2352 million to identifiable intangible assets 

  

including 984 million to developed software to be amortized over ten years 974 million to customer contracts and related relationships to be amortized over 13 years and 394 million to trademarks to be amortized over ten years and 5992 million to goodwill which is not tax deductible 

in valuing deferred revenue on the ansoft balance sheet as of the acquisition date the company applied the fair value provisions applicable to the accounting for business combinations although this purchase accounting requirement had no impact on the company’s business or cash flow the company’s reported revenue under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states primarily for the first 12 months postacquisition was less than the sum of what would otherwise have been reported by ansoft and ansys absent the acquisition 

acquired deferred revenue of 75 million was recorded on the ansoft opening balance sheet this amount was approximately 235 million lower than the historical carrying value the impact on reported revenue for the year ended december 31 2009 was 11 million for lease license revenue and 70 million for maintenance revenue the impact on reported revenue for the year ended december 31 2008 was 17 million for lease license revenue and 130 million for maintenance revenue the expected impact on reported revenue for the year ending december 31 2010 is approximately 360000 

results of operations 

the operating results of ansoft have been included in the results of operations since the acquisition date of july 31 2008 

for purposes of the following discussion and analysis the table below sets forth certain consolidated financial data for the years 2009 2008 and 2007 

 

   

year ended december 31 2009 compared to year ended december 31 2008 

revenue 

 

 the company’s increase in lease license revenue was more than offset by a decline in perpetual license sales the decline in perpetual licenses sales was primarily driven by certain macroeconomic factors as discussed further below the company’s license revenue included ansoft operations for a full year in 2009 of 391 million as compared to five months in 2008 of 211 million 

the increase in maintenance revenue was primarily the result of annual maintenance subscriptions sold in connection with new perpetual license sales in recent quarters as well as the impact of ansoft operations for a full year in 2009 of 441 million as compared to five months in 2008 of 84 million 

the decrease in service revenue was primarily the result of reduced revenue from engineering consulting services as well as a reduction of 700000 related to the company’s 2008 biennial users’ conference 

with respect to revenue on average for the year ended december 31 2009 the us dollar was approximately 37 stronger when measured against the company’s primary foreign currencies than for the year ended december 31 2008 the us dollar strengthened against the british pound euro indian rupee swedish krona and the canadian dollar while it weakened against the japanese yen korean won taiwan dollar and the chinese renminbi the net overall strengthening resulted in decreased revenue and operating income during 2009 as compared with 2008 of approximately 103 million and 36 million respectively 

a substantial portion of the company’s license and maintenance revenue is derived from annual lease and maintenance contracts these contracts are generally renewed on an annual basis and typically have a high rate of customer renewal in addition to the recurring revenue base associated with these contracts a majority of customers purchasing new perpetual licenses also purchase related annual maintenance contracts as a result of the significant recurring revenue base the company’s license and maintenance revenue growth rate in any period does not necessarily correlate to the growth rate of new license and maintenance contracts sold during that period to the extent the rate of customer renewal for lease and maintenance contracts is high incremental lease contracts and maintenance contracts sold with new perpetual licenses will result in license and maintenance revenue growth conversely if the rate of renewal for these contracts is adversely affected by economic or other factors as was the case in 2009 the company’s license and maintenance growth will be adversely affected over the term that the revenue for those contracts would have otherwise been recognized 

the company’s revenue increased 81 in 2009 this revenue growth rate was influenced by the company’s organic growth rate incremental growth from the acquisition of ansoft and the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations although the company’s overall revenue growth in 2009 benefited from the inclusion of a full year of ansoft operations as compared to five months of ansoft operations in 2008 the company experienced a reduction in the perpetual license revenue of the nonansoft operations caused by the disruption in domestic and global economies and the net adverse impact of currency fluctuations reductions in the company’s revenue growth rate adversely impacted the company’s operating income net income and earnings per share in 2009 

  

international and domestic revenues as a percentage of total revenue were 667 and 333 respectively during the year ended december 31 2009 and 683 and 317 respectively during the year ended december 31 2008 

in valuing deferred revenue on the ansoft balance sheet as of the acquisition date the company applied the fair value provisions applicable to the accounting for business combinations although this purchase accounting requirement had no impact on the company’s business or cash flow the company’s reported revenue under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states primarily for the first 12 months postacquisition was less than the sum of what would otherwise have been reported by ansoft and ansys absent the acquisition 

acquired deferred revenue of 75 million was recorded on the ansoft opening balance sheet this amount was approximately 235 million lower than the historical carrying value the impact on reported revenue for the year ended december 31 2009 was 11 million for lease license revenue and 70 million for maintenance revenue the impact on reported revenue for the year ended december 31 2008 was 17 million for lease license revenue and 130 million for maintenance revenue the expected impact on reported revenue for the year ending december 31 2010 is approximately 360000 

cost of sales and gross profit 

 

 the change in cost of sales is primarily due to the following 

 

  

  

  

  

 the improvement in the gross profit was a result of the increase in revenue offset by a smaller increase in related cost of sales 

  

operating expenses 

 

 selling general and administrative ansoftrelated selling general and administrative costs increased 121 million primarily the result of a full year of activity for the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to five months of activity for the year ended december 31 2008 nonansoft expenses decreased by 97 million during the year ended december 31 2009 primarily the result of decreased salary and headcountrelated costs including incentive compensation of 50 million decreased marketing advertising and event costs of 24 million decreased business travel expenses of 12 million and decreased consulting costs of 11 million 

the company anticipates that it will continue to make targeted investments in its global sales and marketing organization and its global business infrastructure to enhance major account sales activities and to support its worldwide sales distribution and marketing strategies and the business in general 

research and development ansoftrelated research and development increased 105 million primarily associated with a full year of activity for the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to five months of activity for the year ended december 31 2008 nonansoft expenses decreased by 22 million during the year ended december 31 2009 primarily the result of decreased incentive compensation costs of 19 million 

the company has traditionally invested significant resources in research and development activities and intends to continue to make investments in this area particularly as it relates to ongoing integration evolution of its ansys workbench platform and expanding capabilities within its broad portfolio of software technologies 

amortization ansoftrelated amortization expense increased 62 million for the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to the prior year the increase relates to a full year of amortization expense in 2009 associated with certain acquired intangible assets compared to five months of amortization in the 2008 period this increase was partially offset by a 600000 decrease in amortization of the fluent customer list 

restructuring charges the company incurred operating restructuring charges of 27 million during the year ended december 31 2009 associated with workforce reduction activities which related to the company’s ongoing effort to manage expenses and cost structure 

interest expense  the company’s interest expense consists of the following 

 

   

the increased interest costs shown above for the 2009 period are primarily a result of a higher average outstanding debt balance partially offset by a lower weighted average effective interest rate of 341 as compared to 472 in the corresponding 2008 period the decreased amortization costs are primarily a result of additional amortization expense recorded in 2008 associated with the early payoff of the 2006 term loan 

the company’s interest rate swap agreement is utilized to hedge a portion of each of the first eight forecasted quarterly variable rate interest payments on the company’s term loan under the swap agreement the company receives the variable threemonth libor rate required under its term loan and pays a fixed libor interest rate of 332 on the notional amount this swap agreement resulted in additional interest expense during the year ended december 31 2009 because the variable threemonth libor rate was lower than the fixed libor rate of 332 during each of the 2009 quarterly periods 

interest income  interest income for the year ended december 31 2009 was 17 million as compared to 56 million for the year ended december 31 2008 interest income decreased as a result of a significant decline in interest rates in the 2009 period as compared to the 2008 period partially offset by additional interest income associated with an increase in invested cash balances 

other expense income net the company recorded other expense of 13 million during the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to other income of 727000 for the year ended december 31 2008 the net change was primarily the result of foreign currency transaction gains and losses as the company’s presence in foreign locations continues to expand the company will have increased exposure to volatility of foreign exchange rates for the foreseeable future 

income tax provision the company recorded income tax expense of 571 million and had income before income taxes of 1735 million for the year ended december 31 2009 this represents an effective tax rate of 329 for the year ended december 31 2009 during the year ended december 31 2008 the company recorded income tax expense of 550 million and had income before income taxes of 1667 million the company’s effective tax rate was 330 for the year ended december 31 2008 the company’s effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2009 was favorably impacted when compared to the rate in the year ended december 31 2008 by additional benefit related to domestic manufacturing activity the company also recorded tax benefits of 20 million during 2009 related to the favorable settlement of various outstanding ansys and ansoft tax audits during the third quarter of 2008 the company filed its 2007 us federal and state tax returns in conjunction with the completion of these returns the company adjusted its estimate for 2007 taxes to reflect the actual results and recorded a net tax benefit of 12 million the effect of this adjustment reduced the 2008 effective tax rate from 337 to 330 

the effective tax rates when compared to the federal and state combined statutory rate are favorably impacted by lower statutory tax rates in many of the company’s foreign jurisdictions domestic manufacturing deductions and research and experimentation credits these rates are also impacted by charges or benefits associated with the company’s uncertain tax positions 

net income the company’s net income for the year ended december 31 2009 was 1164 million as compared to net income of 1117 million for the year ended december 31 2008 diluted earnings per share was 127 for the year ended december 31 2009 and 129 for the year ended december 31 2008 the weighted average shares used in computing diluted earnings per share were 918 million and 868 million during the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively 

  

year ended december 31 2008 compared to year ended december 31 2007 

revenue 

 

 the increase in software license revenue was the result of overall growth in both lease and perpetual license sales as well as the addition of ansoftrelated revenue of 211 million for the period from the acquisition july 31 2008 through december 31 2008 

the increase in maintenance revenue was primarily the result of annual maintenance subscriptions sold in connection with new perpetual license sales in recent quarters and ansoftrelated maintenance revenue of 84 million for the period from the acquisition july 31 2008 through december 31 2008 

the decrease in service revenue was primarily the result of reduced revenue from engineering consulting services this decrease was partially offset by service revenue of 700000 related to the company’s 2008 biennial users’ conference 

with respect to revenue on average for the year ended december 31 2008 the us dollar was approximately 28 weaker when measured against the company’s primary foreign currencies than for the year ended december 31 2007 the us dollar weakened against the euro chinese renminbi swedish krona and the japanese yen while it strengthened against the british pound indian rupee and canadian dollar the net overall weakening throughout the year resulted in increased revenue and operating income during 2008 as compared with 2007 of approximately 55 million and 22 million respectively 

international and domestic revenues as a percentage of total revenue were 683 and 317 respectively during the year ended december 31 2008 and 658 and 342 respectively during the year ended december 31 2007

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the company believes that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 

revenue is derived principally from the licensing of computer software products and from related maintenance contracts revenue from perpetual licenses is classified as license revenue and is recognized upon delivery of the licensed product and the utility that enables the customer to access authorization keys provided 

  

that acceptance has occurred and a signed contractual obligation has been received the price is fixed and determinable and collectibility of the receivable is probable the company determines the fair value of postcontract customer support “pcs” sold together with perpetual licenses based on the contractual renewal rate for pcs when sold on a standalone basis revenue from pcs contracts is classified as maintenance and service revenue and is recognized ratably over the term of the contract 

revenue for software lease licenses is classified as license revenue and is recognized over the period of the lease contract typically the company’s software leases include pcs which due to the short term principally one year or less of the company’s software lease licenses cannot be separated from lease revenue for accounting purposes as a result both the lease license and pcs are recognized ratably over the lease period due to the shortterm nature of the software lease licenses and the frequency with which the company provides major product upgrades typically 12 – 18 months the company does not believe that a significant portion of the fee paid under the arrangement is attributable to the pcs component of the arrangement and as a result includes the revenue for the entire arrangement within software license revenue in the consolidated statements of income 

revenue from training support and other services is recognized as the services are performed the company applies the specific performance method to contracts in which the service consists of a single act such as providing a training class to a customer and the proportional performance method to other service contracts that are longer in duration and often include multiple acts for example both training and consulting in applying the proportional performance method the company typically utilizes outputbased estimates for services with contractual billing arrangements that are not based on time and materials and estimates output based on the total tasks completed as compared to the total tasks required for each work contract inputbased estimates are utilized for services that involve general consultations with contractual billing arrangements based on time and materials utilizing direct labor as the input measure 

the company also executes arrangements through channel partners in which the channel partners are authorized to market and distribute the company’s software products to end users of the company’s products and services in specified territories in sales facilitated by channel partners the channel partner bears the risk of collection from the end user customer the company recognizes revenue from transactions with channel partners when the channel partner submits a written purchase commitment collectibility from the channel partner is probable a signed license agreement is received from the end user customer and delivery has occurred to the end user customer provided that all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied revenue from channel partner transactions is the amount remitted to the company by the channel partners this amount includes a fee for pcs that is compensation for providing technical enhancements and the second level of technical support to the end user which is based on the contractual renewal rate in the end user customer’s license agreement and is recognized over the period that pcs is to be provided the company does not offer right of return product rotation or price protection to any of its channel partners 

nonincome related taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are recorded on the balance sheet as accounts receivable and accrued expenses the collection and payment of these amounts is reported on a net basis in the consolidated statements of income and does not impact reported revenues or expenses 

the company warrants to its customers that its software will substantially perform as specified in the company’s most current user manuals the company has not experienced significant claims related to software warranties beyond the scope of maintenance support which the company is already obligated to provide and consequently the company has not established reserves for warranty obligations 

the company’s agreements with its customers generally require it to indemnify the customer against claims that the company’s software infringes third party patent copyright trademark or other proprietary rights such indemnification obligations are generally limited in a variety of industrystandard respects including the 

  

company’s right to replace an infringing product as of december 31 2009 the company had not experienced any losses related to these indemnification obligations and no claims with respect thereto were outstanding the company does not expect significant claims related to these indemnification obligations and consequently the company has not established any related reserves 

the company makes judgments as to its ability to collect outstanding receivables and provides allowances for a portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices from both value and delinquency perspectives for those invoices not specifically reviewed provisions are provided at differing rates based upon the age of the receivable and the geographical area of origin in determining these percentages the company considers its historical collection experience and current economic trends in the customer’s industry and geographic region if the historical data used to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and future results of operations could be materially affected 

the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period of the enactment date 

the company records net deferred tax assets to the extent it believes these assets will more likely than not be realized in making such determination the company considers all available positive and negative evidence including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and recent financial operations in the event the company determines that it would be able to realize deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be recorded that would reduce the provision for income taxes 

in july 2006 accounting guidance was issued on accounting for the uncertainty in income taxes the accounting guidance clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements the accounting guidance clarified that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits income tax positions must meet a morelikelythannot recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized upon the adoption of the accounting guidance and in subsequent periods the accounting guidance also provides guidance on measurement derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition the company adopted the accounting guidance on january 1 2007 

the company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the income tax expense line in the accompanying consolidated statements of income accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheet 

the company tests goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment at least annually by comparing the fair value of each asset or in the case of goodwill the company’s reporting units to its carrying value fair value is estimated using the discounted cash flow and other valuation methodologies in preparing the estimate of fair value the company relies on a number of factors including historical operating results business plans anticipated future cash flows economic projections and other market data because there are inherent uncertainties involved in these factors the company’s estimates of fair value are imprecise and the resulting carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets may be misstated when the company assigns a fair value to a trademark it also estimates whether it has a finite or indefinite life thus impacting whether the value is amortized or not events such as product and naming strategy changes can occur whereby the company may reconsider the life whether finite or indefinite resulting in changes to amortization expense amortization periods may also be reconsidered for identifiable intangible assets with finite lives 

  

the company is involved in various investigations claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of its business activities the company reviews the status of these matters assesses its financial exposure and records a related accrual if the potential loss from an investigation claim or legal proceeding is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable significant judgment is involved in the determination of probability and in the determination of whether an exposure is reasonably estimable as a result of the uncertainties involved in making these estimates the company may have to revise its estimates as facts and circumstances change the revision of these estimates could have a material impact on the company’s financial position and results of operations 

the company grants options to purchase its common stock to employees and directors under the company’s stock option plan eligible employees can also purchase shares of the company’s common stock at a discount under the company’s employee stock purchase plan the benefits provided under these plans are sharebased payments subject to the provisions of sharebased payment accounting guidance the company uses the fair value method to apply the provisions of sharebased payment accounting guidance sharebased compensation expense for 2009 2008 and 2007 was 132 million 118 million and 89 million respectively as of december 31 2009 total unrecognized estimated compensation expense related to unvested stock options granted prior to that date was 388 million which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 20 years net stock options after forfeitures and cancellations granted during 2009 2008 and 2007 represented 134 126 and 109 respectively of outstanding shares as of the beginning of each fiscal year net stock options after forfeitures and cancellations granted during 2009 2008 and 2007 represented 133 110 and 107 respectively of outstanding shares as of the end of each fiscal year in addition during 2008 the company issued 195 million options pursuant to assumed stock options associated with the acquisition of ansoft representing 249 and 218 of outstanding shares as of the beginning and end of the 2008 fiscal year respectively of the options issued associated with the acquisition 194 million were fully vested as of the acquisition date 

the value of each sharebased award was estimated on the date of grant using the blackscholes option pricing model “blackscholes model” the determination of the fair value of sharebased payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by the company’s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables these variables include the company’s expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors riskfree interest rates and expected dividends the table below presents the assumptions used in calculating the compensation expense recorded within the company’s consolidated statements of income for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 the interest rates used were determined by using the fiveyear treasury note yield on the date of grant 

 

 the company issues both nonqualified and incentive stock options however incentive stock options comprise a significant portion of outstanding stock options the tax benefits associated with incentive stock options are unpredictable as they are predicated upon an award recipient triggering an event that disqualifies the award and that then results in a tax deduction to the company sharebased payment accounting guidance requires that these tax benefits be recorded at the time of the triggering event the triggering events for each option holder are not easily projected in order to estimate the tax benefits related to incentive stock options the company makes many assumptions and estimates including the number of incentive stock options that will be exercised during the period by us employees the number of incentive stock options that will be disqualified during the period and the fair market value of the company’s stock price on the exercise dates each of these items is subject to significant uncertainty additionally a significant portion of the tax benefits related to 

  

disqualified incentive stock options is accounted for as an increase to equity additional paidin capital rather than as a reduction in income tax expense although all such benefits continue to be realized through the company’s tax filings this accounting treatment has the effect of increasing tax expense and reducing net income for example the company realized a tax benefit of 75 million during the year ended december 31 2009 related to disqualified dispositions of incentive stock options however only 369000 of such amount was recorded as a reduction in income tax expense although there are significant limitations in estimating stockbased compensation expense including those discussed above the company currently estimates that these costs will result in a decrease in 2010 operating income of approximately 180 million  200 million and a decrease in 2010 net income of approximately 140 million  156 million or approximately 015  017 per diluted share 

if factors change and the company employs different assumptions in the application of sharebased payment accounting guidance in future periods the compensation expense that the company will record may differ significantly from what the company has recorded in the current period therefore it is important for investors to be aware of the high degree of subjectivity involved when using option pricing models to estimate sharebased compensation option pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions are fully transferable and do not cause dilution because the company’s sharebased payments have characteristics significantly different from those of freely traded options and because changes in the input assumptions can materially affect the company’s estimates of fair values in the company’s opinion existing valuation models including the blackscholes models may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of the company’s sharebased compensation consequently there is a risk that the company’s estimates of the fair values of the company’s sharebased compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise expiration early termination or forfeiture of those sharebased payments in the future certain sharebased payments such as employee stock options may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in the company’s financial statements alternatively value may be realized from these instruments that is significantly in excess of the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in the company’s financial statements there is currently no marketbased mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models nor is there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values although the fair value of employee sharebased awards is determined in accordance with sharebased payment accounting guidance using an option pricing model that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyerseller market transaction 

estimates of sharebased compensation expenses are significant to the company’s financial statements but these expenses are based on the aforementioned option valuation model and will never result in the payment of cash by the company for this reason and because the company does not view sharebased compensation as related to its operational performance the board of directors and management exclude estimated sharebased compensation expense when evaluating the company’s underlying business performance

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend interest income rate risk  changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest income that is generated from the company’s cash and shortterm investments for the year ended december 31 2009 total interest income was 17 million cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of highly liquid investments such as time deposits held at major banks money market mutual funds and other securities with original maturities of three months or less the company considers investments backed by government agencies or us financial institutions to be highly liquid and accordingly classifies such investments as shortterm investments 

  

interest expense rate risk in connection with the fluent acquisition the company entered into two credit agreements as of may 1 2006 with variable interest rates and total borrowings of 198 million the amounts borrowed with respect to one of the credit agreements were paid in full as of december 31 2006 the amounts borrowed with respect to the second credit agreement were paid in full as of june 30 2008 in connection with the ansoft acquisition the company entered into a 3550 million term loan with variable interest rates as of july 31 2008 the term loan is scheduled to mature on july 31 2013 and provides for tiered pricing with the initial rate at the prime rate  050 or the libor rate  150 with step downs permitted after the initial six months under the credit agreement down to a flat prime rate or the libor rate  075 such tiered pricing is determined by the company’s consolidated leverage ratio the credit agreement includes quarterly financial covenants requiring the company to maintain certain financial ratios and as is customary for facilities of this type certain events of default that permit the acceleration of the loan borrowings outstanding under this facility totaled 2251 million as of december 31 2009 

the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement in order to hedge a portion of each of the first eight forecasted quarterly variable rate interest payments on the company’s term loan under the swap agreement the company receives the variable threemonth libor rate required under its term loan and pays a fixed libor interest rate of 332 on the notional amount the initial notional amount of 3000 million is amortized equally at an amount of 375 million over eight quarters through june 30 2010 

for the year ended december 31 2009 the company recorded interest expense related to the term loan at a weighted average interest rate of 341 if the company did not enter into the interest rate swap agreement the weighted average interest rates would have been 188 for the year ended december 31 2008 the company recorded interest expense related to the term loans at a weighted average interest rate of 472 if the company did not enter into the interest rate swap agreement the weighted average interest rate would have been 473 the interest expense on the term loans and amortization related to debt financing costs were as follows 

 

 the interest rate for the july 31 2008 term loan is set for the first quarter of 2010 as follows 

 

 based on the effective interest rates and remaining outstanding borrowings at december 31 2009 the company’s interest expense on the term loan for the quarter ending march 31 2010 will be approximately 11 million a 050 increase in interest rates would not impact the company’s interest expense for the quarter ending march 31 2010 based on the effective interest rates and remaining outstanding borrowings at december 31 2009 assuming contractual quarterly principal payments are made a 050 increase in interest rates would increase the company’s interest expense by approximately 10 million for the year ending december 31 2010 

  

foreign currency transaction risk  the company’s acquisition of ansoft has increased its business presence in international locations particularly in the asiapacific region as the company continues to expand its business presence in international regions the portion of its revenue expenses cash accounts receivable and payment obligations denominated in foreign currencies continues to increase as a result changes in currency exchange rates will affect the company’s financial position results of operations and cash flows the company is most impacted by movements in and among the british pound euro japanese yen canadian dollar indian rupee swedish krona chinese renminbi korean won taiwan dollar and the us dollar 

with respect to revenue on average for the year ended december 31 2009 the us dollar was approximately 37 stronger when measured against the company’s primary foreign currencies than for the year ended december 31 2008 the us dollar strengthened against the british pound euro indian rupee swedish krona and the canadian dollar while it weakened against the japanese yen korean won taiwan dollar and the chinese renminbi the net overall strengthening resulted in decreased revenue and operating income during 2009 as compared with 2008 of approximately 103 million and 36 million respectively had the activity for the year ended december 31 2009 been recorded at the december 31 2009 spot rates for each subsidiary’s functional currency the revenue and operating income would have increased by 65 million and 28 million respectively 

the most significant impact on revenue and operating income were primarily attributable to us dollar exchange rate changes against the euro british pound and japanese yen as reflected in the charts below

information with respect to foreign and domestic revenue may be found in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k and in the section entitled “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in part ii item 7 of this annual report on form 10k 

strategic alliances and marketing relationships 

the company has established and continues to pursue strategic alliances with advanced technology suppliers and marketing relationships with hardware vendors specialized application developers and computeraided design “cad” and plm providers the company believes that these relationships facilitate accelerated incorporation of advanced technology into the company’s products provide access to new customers expand the company’s sales channels develop specialized product applications and provide direct integration with leading cad electronic design automation “eda” product data management and plm systems 

the company has technical and marketing relationships with leading cad vendors such as autodesk dassault systèmes parametric technology corporation solid works and siemens product lifecycle management software inc to provide direct links between products these links facilitate the transfer of electronic data models between the cad systems and ansys products in addition the company has an agreement with dassault systèmes under which ansys fluid flow modeling technology is embedded in the catia v5 product lifecycle management environment this fully integrated product fluent for catia v5 enables model building computation postprocessing and data management within the analysis infrastructure of catia v5 the company also has an agreement with autodesk under which autodesk licenses ansys partlevel stress and resonant frequency simulation technologies and packages them as an integral part of the autodesk inventor professional product 

similarly the company maintains marketing and software development relationships with leading software companies in the eda market including cadence synopsys and mentor graphics these relationships support transfer of data between electronics design and layout packages and the ansys and ansoft electronics simulation portfolio 

the company has established relationships with leading suppliers of computer hardware including intel amd microsoft hewlettpackard sgi sun microsystems ibm dell cray panasas qlogic mellanox and other leading regional channel partner and system integrators these relationships provide the company with joint marketing opportunities such as advertising public relations editorial coverage and customer events in addition these alliances provide the company with early access and technical collaboration on new processors and related computing technologies ensuring that the company’s software products are certified to run effectively on the most current hardware platforms key 2008 milestones include support for updated multicore processors from intel and amd adoption of intel software development tools for code profiling and optimization and porting to the microsoft hpc server 2008 operating system 

the company’s enhanced solution partner program actively encourages specialized developers of software solutions to use ansys technology as a development platform for their applications in most cases the sale of the enhanced solution partners’ products is accompanied by the sale of an ansys product in the past year the company initiated more than 25 new enhanced solution partnerships spanning a wide range of technologies including electronics turbomachinery cad and acoustics partnerships focusing on the introduction of simulation technology to the workbench environment remained a priority in 2008 of particular significance was the introduction by spaceclaim corporation of a new fully associative interface between the 3d direct modeling 

  

package spaceclaim professional and workbench other examples include the development of a new simulation capability for the turbomachinery sector working with pca engineers limited and the development of a new fatigue simulation capability through collaboration with ncode international 

the company has a software license agreement with livermore software technology corporation “lstc” under which lstc has provided lsdyna software for explicit dynamics solutions used in applications such as crash test simulations in the automotive and other industries under this arrangement lstc assists in the integration of the lsdyna software with the company’s pre and postprocessing capabilities and provides updates and problem resolution in return for a share of revenue from sales of the ansyslsdyna combined product 

competition 

the company believes that the principal factors affecting sales of its software include ease of use breadth and depth of functionality flexibility quality ease of integration with other software systems file compatibility across computer platforms range of supported computer platforms performance price and cost of ownership customer service and support company reputation and financial viability and effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts 

the company continues to experience intense competition across all markets for its products and services some of the company’s current and possible future competitors have greater financial technical marketing and other resources than the company and some have well established relationships with current and potential customers of the company these competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes price reductions andor increased operating costs and could result in lower revenues margins and net income 

proprietary rights and licenses 

the company regards its software as proprietary and relies on a combination of trade secret copyright patent and trademark laws license agreements nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect its proprietary rights in its products the company distributes its software products under software license agreements that grant customers nonexclusive licenses for the use of the company’s products which are typically nontransferable license agreements for the company’s products are directly between the company and end users use of the licensed software product is restricted to specified sites unless the customer obtains a multisite license for its use of the software product software security measures are also employed to prevent unauthorized use of the company’s software products and the licensed software is subject to terms and conditions prohibiting unauthorized reproduction of the software customers may purchase a perpetual license of the technology with the right to annually purchase ongoing maintenance technical support and updates or may lease the product on a fixed term basis for a fee that includes the license maintenance technical support and upgrades 

the company licenses its software products utilizing a combination of webbased and hard copy license terms and forms for certain software products the company primarily relies on “clickwrapped” licenses the enforceability of these types of agreements under the laws of some jurisdictions is uncertain 

the company also seeks to protect the source code of its software as a trade secret and as unpublished copyrighted work the company has obtained federal trademark registration protection for ansys ansys workbench autodyn cfx fluent maxwell and other marks in the us and in foreign countries additionally the company was awarded a patent by the us patent and trademark office for its webbased reporting technology 

employees of the company have signed agreements under which they have agreed not to disclose trade secrets or confidential information and where legally permitted that restrict engagement in or connection with any business that is competitive with the company anywhere in the world while employed by the company and 

  

in some cases for specified periods thereafter and that any products or technology created by them during their term of employment are the property of the company in addition the company requires all channel partners to enter into agreements not to disclose the company’s trade secrets and other proprietary information 

despite these precautions there can be no assurance that misappropriation of the company’s technology and proprietary information will not occur further there can be no assurance that copyright trademark patent and trade secret protection will be available for the company’s products in certain countries or that restrictions on the ability of employees and channel partners to engage in activities competitive with the company will be enforceable 

the software development industry is characterized by rapid technological change therefore the company believes that factors such as the technological and creative skills of its personnel new product developments frequent product enhancements name recognition and reliable product maintenance are also important to establishing and maintaining technology leadership in addition to the various legal protections of its technology that may be available 

the company does not believe that any of its products infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties there can be no assurance however that third parties will not claim such infringement by the company or its licensors or licensees with respect to current or future products the company expects that software suppliers will increasingly be subject to the risk of such claims as the number of products and suppliers continues to expand and the functionality of products continues to increase any such claims with or without merit could be time consuming result in costly litigation cause product shipment delays or require the company to enter into royalty or licensing agreements such royalty or licensing agreements if required may not be available on terms acceptable to the company 

seasonal variations 

the company’s business has experienced seasonality including quarterly reductions in software sales resulting from the slowdown during the summer months particularly in europe as well as from the seasonal purchasing and budgeting patterns of the company’s global customers 

backlog 

the company generally ships its products within 30 days after acceptance of an order and execution of a software license agreement accordingly the company does not believe that its backlog at any particular point in time is indicative of future sales levels 

employees 

as of december 31 2008 the company and its subsidiaries had approximately 1750 fulltime employees at that date there were also contract personnel and coop students providing ongoing development services and technical support the company believes that its relationship with its employees is good

 item 1a risk factors tableend information provided by the company or its spokespersons including information contained in this annual report on form 10k may from time to time contain forwardlooking statements concerning projected financial performance market and industry sector growth product development and commercialization or other aspects of future operations such statements will be based on the assumptions and expectations of the company’s management at the time such statements are made the company cautions investors that its performance and therefore any forwardlooking statement is subject to risks and uncertainties various important factors including but not limited to the following may cause the company’s future results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statement 

adverse conditions in the global economy and disruption in financial markets as widely reported financial markets in the united states europe and asia have been experiencing extreme disruption in recent months including among other things extreme volatility in security prices severely diminished liquidity and credit availability rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others while currently these conditions have not impaired the company’s ability to access credit markets and finance operations there can be no assurance that there will not be a further deterioration in financial markets and confidence in major economies the company is impacted by these economic developments both domestically and globally in that the current tightening of credit in financial markets adversely affects the ability of its customers and suppliers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations and could result in a decrease in orders for the company’s products and services these economic conditions may negatively impact the company as some of its customers defer purchasing decisions thereby lengthening the company’s sales cycles in addition certain of the company’s customers’ budgets may be constrained and they may be unable to purchase our products at the same level the company’s customers’ ability to pay for the company’s products and services may also be impaired which may lead to an increase in the company’s allowance for doubtful accounts and writeoffs of accounts receivable the company is unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the current disruption in financial markets and adverse economic conditions in the us and other countries should these economic conditions result in the company not meeting its revenue growth objectives the company’s operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

decline in customers’ business the company’s sales are based significantly on end user demand for products in key industrial sectors many of these sectors periodically experience economic declines which may be exacerbated by other economic factors including the current global economic disruptions these factors may adversely affect the company’s business by extending sales cycles and reducing revenue these economic factors may cause the company’s customers to reduce the size of their workforce or cut back on operations which may lead to a reduction in license renewals or ongoing maintenance contracts with the company the company’s customers may also request discounts or extended payment terms on new products or seek to extend payment terms on existing contracts all of which may cause fluctuations in the company’s future operating results the company may not be able to adjust its operating expenses to offset such fluctuations because a substantial portion of the company’s operating expenses is related to personnel facilities and marketing programs the level of personnel and related expenses may not be able to be adjusted quickly enough and is based in significant part on the company’s expectation for future revenue 

risks associated with international activities a majority of the company’s business comes from outside the united states and the company has customers that supply a wide spectrum of goods and services in virtually all of the world’s major economic regions as the company continues to expand its direct sales presence in international regions the portion of its revenue expenses cash accounts receivable and payment obligations denominated in foreign currencies continues to increase the company’s revenues and operating results are adversely affected when the us dollar strengthens relative to other currencies and are positively affected when the us dollar weakens as a result changes in currency exchange rates from time to time may affect the company’s financial position results of operations and cash flows in the event that there are economic declines in countries in which the company conducts transactions the resulting changes in currency exchange rates may from time to time affect the company’s financial position results of operations and cash flows the company is 

  

most impacted by movements in and among the british pound euro japanese yen canadian dollar indian rupee swedish krona chinese renminbi korean won taiwan dollar and the us dollar the company seeks to reduce these risks primarily through its normal operating and treasury activities but there can be no assurances it will be successful in reducing these risks 

in addition the company’s new subsidiary ansoft derives a significant portion of its total revenue from sales in asia and ansoft accounts for approximately 20 of the company’s total business prior to acquiring ansoft the company had less exposure to asia if asian economies and the company’s new asiabased clients experience downturns in performance the results of operations of ansoft may be adversely affected which may have an adverse affect on the company’s combined business results of operation and cash flows the acquisition has also significantly increased the company’s exposure to asian currencies and exchange rates changes in currency exchange rates in asian nations from which a significant portion of ansoft’s revenue is derived may affect the company’s financial position results of operations and cash flows 

additional risks inherent in the company’s international business activities include imposition of government controls export license requirements restrictions on the export of critical technology products and services political and economic instability trade restrictions changes in tariffs and taxes difficulties in staffing and managing international operations longer accounts receivable payment cycles and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations effective patent copyright trademark and trade secret protection may not be available in every foreign country in which the company sells its products and services the company’s business financial position results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks 

stock market and stock price volatility market prices for securities of software companies have generally been volatile in particular the market price of the company’s common stock has been and may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations as a result of factors affecting the company the software industry or the securities markets in general such factors include but are not limited to declines in trading price that may be triggered by the company’s failure to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors in light of current economic conditions in the united states and abroad the market for securities on the nasdaq stock market has seen significant increases in price and volume volatility in many cases unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the affected companies the price of the company’s common stock has decreased approximately 327 from january 1 2008 to december 31 2008 the company cannot provide assurance that in such circumstances the trading price of the company’s common stock will recover or that it will not experience a further decline moreover the trading price could be subject to additional fluctuations in response to quartertoquarter variations in the company’s operating results material announcements made by the company or its competitors conditions in the financial markets or the software industry generally or other events and factors many of which are beyond the company’s control 

rapidly changing technology new products risk of product defects the company operates in an industry generally characterized by rapidly changing technology and frequent new product introductions that can render existing products obsolete or unmarketable a major factor in the company’s future success will be its ability to anticipate technological changes and to develop and introduce in a timely manner enhancements to its existing products products acquired in acquisitions and new products to meet those changes including in particular the upcoming release of ansys 120 if the company is unable to introduce new products and to respond quickly to industry changes its business financial position results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

the introduction and marketing of new or enhanced products require the company to manage the transition from existing products in order to minimize disruption in customer purchasing patterns there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing and marketing on a timely basis new products or product enhancements that its new products will adequately address the changing needs of the marketplace or that it will successfully manage the transition from existing products software products as complex as those 

  

offered by the company may contain undetected errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are released and the likelihood of errors is increased as a result of the company’s commitment to accelerating the frequency of its product releases there can be no assurance that errors will not be found in any new or enhanced products after commencement of commercial shipments certain of these products require a higher level of sales and support expertise the ability of the company’s sales channel particularly the indirect channel to obtain this expertise and to sell the new product offerings effectively could have an adverse impact on the company’s sales in future periods 

in particular the company intends to release ansys 120 software in 2009 and expects it to be a significant driver of the company’s future revenue there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in marketing the ansys 120 software or that these products will be accepted by the marketplace if the release of ansys 120 software is not as successful as management currently anticipates if the product contains undetected errors or failures upon release if the company experiences delays in the release or if the company experiences difficulties in providing sales and support expertise for the suite the company may experience a loss of or delay in customer acceptance diversion of development resources damage to the company’s reputation or increased service and warranty costs any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

dependence on channel partners the company continues to distribute a meaningful portion of its products through its global network of independent regional channel partners the channel partners sell the company’s software products to new and existing customers expand installations within the existing customer base offer consulting services and provide the first line of technical support consequently in certain geographies the company is highly dependent upon the efforts of the channel partners difficulties in ongoing relationships with channel partners such as failure to meet performance criteria or to promote the company’s products as aggressively as the company expects and differences in the handling of customer relationships could adversely affect the company’s performance additionally the loss of any major channel partner for any reason including a channel partner’s decision to sell competing products rather than the company’s products could have a material adverse effect on the company moreover the company’s future success will depend substantially on the ability and willingness of its channel partners to continue to dedicate the resources necessary to promote the company’s portfolio of products and to support a larger installed base of the company’s products if the channel partners are unable or unwilling to do so the company may be unable to sustain revenue growth 

during times of significant fluctuations in world currencies certain channel partners may have solvency issues to the extent that effective hedge transactions are not employed or there is not sufficient working capital in particular if the us dollar strengthens relative to other currencies certain channel partners who pay the company in us dollars may have trouble paying the company on time or may have trouble distributing the company’s products due to the impact of the currency exchange fluctuation on such channel partner’s cash flows this may impact the company’s ability to distribute its products into certain regions and markets which may have an adverse affect on the company’s results of operations and cash flows 

competition the company continues to experience intense competition across all markets for its products and services some of the company’s current and possible future competitors have greater financial technical marketing and other resources than the company and some have well established relationships with current and potential customers of the company these competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes price reductions andor increased operating costs and could result in lower revenues margins and net income 

dependence on senior management and key technical personnel the company’s success depends upon the continued services of the company’s senior executives key technical employees and other employees each of the company’s executive officers key technical personnel and other employees could terminate his or her relationship with the company at any time the loss of any of the company’s senior executives might significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives and could materially harm our business 

  

and customer relationships in addition because of the highly technical nature of the company’s products the loss of any significant number of our existing engineering and development personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 

dependence on proprietary technology the company’s success is highly dependent upon its proprietary technology the company generally relies on contracts and the laws of copyright and trade secrets to protect its technology the company maintains a trade secrets program enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees and channel partners and limits access to and distribution of its software documentation and other proprietary information there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company to protect its proprietary technology will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of its technology by third parties or that third parties will not be able to develop similar technology independently although the company is not aware that any of its technology infringes upon the rights of third parties there can be no assurance that other parties will not assert technology infringement claims against the company or that if asserted such claims will not prevail 

reliance on perpetual licenses although the company has historically maintained stable recurring revenue from the sale of software lease licenses software maintenance subscriptions and third party royalties it also has relied on sales of perpetual licenses that involve payment of a single upfront fee and that are more typical in the computer software industry additionally the acquisition of ansoft has resulted in an increase in the company’s perpetual license revenue as compared to its total revenue while revenue generated from software lease licenses software maintenance subscriptions and third party royalties currently represents a portion of the company’s revenue to the extent that perpetual license revenue continues to represent a significant percentage of total revenue the company’s revenue in any period will depend increasingly on sales completed during that period 

risks associated with acquisitions historically the company has consummated acquisitions in order to support the company’s longterm strategic direction provide greater scale to increase its investments in research and development to accelerate innovation provide increased capabilities to its existing products and supply new products and services expand its customer base or enhance its distribution channels including the 2006 acquisition of fluent and the 2008 acquisition of ansoft in the future the company may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or if suitable candidates are identified the company may not be able to complete the business combination on commercially acceptable terms the process of exploring and pursuing acquisition opportunities may result in devotion of significant management and financial resources 

even if the company is able to consummate acquisitions that it believes will be successful such transactions present many risks significant risks to such acquisitions include among others failing to achieve anticipated synergies and revenue increases difficulty incorporating and integrating the acquired technologies or products with the company’s existing product lines coordinating establishing or expanding sales distribution and marketing functions as necessary disruption of the company’s ongoing business and diversion of management’s attention to transition or integration issues unanticipated and unknown liabilities the loss of key employees customers partners and channel partners of the company or of the acquired company and difficulties implementing and maintaining sufficient controls policies and procedures over the systems products and processes of the acquired company if we do not achieve the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by our management and financial or industry analysts or if others do not perceive the same benefits of the acquisition as we do there could be a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in addition for companies acquired limited experience will exist for several quarters following the acquisition relating to how the acquired company’s sales pipelines will convert into sales or revenues and the conversion rate postacquisition may be quite different than the historical conversion rate because a substantial portion of the company’s software license revenue is completed in the latter part of a quarter and its cost structure is largely fixed in the short term revenue shortfalls may have a negative impact on the company’s profitability a delay in a small number of large new software license transactions could cause the company’s quarterly software license revenues to fall significantly short of its predictions 

  

risks associated with the ansoft acquisition on july 31 2008 the company completed its acquisition of ansoft for a total purchase price of approximately 8239 million the company used a combination of existing cash and proceeds from a 3550 million unsecured senior term loan credit facility to fund the transaction while the acquisition of ansoft is expected to increase operational efficiency lower design and engineering costs for customers and accelerate development and delivery of new innovative products to the marketplace the company will need to meet significant challenges to realize the expected benefits and synergies of the acquisition these significant challenges include among others integrating sales and business development operations while retaining existing customers of each company and developing new products and services that utilize the technologies and resources of both companies the accomplishment of these postacquisition objectives will involve considerable risks including among others the potential disruption of each company’s ongoing business and operations and distraction of their respective management teams moreover there may be significant challenges in incorporating acquired technology and intellectual property into the company’s products and services if the company does not succeed in addressing these challenges or any other problems encountered in connection with the acquisition its operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

the company continues to believe that the acquisition of ansoft will be accretive within the first year following the acquisition the company’s ability to realize this goal will depend on meeting many of the challenges outlined above in the event that ansoft is not accretive within the first year following the acquisition or to the extent anticipated by our management and financial or industry analysts it may have an adverse effect on the company’s business financial position and reputation 

disruption of operations or infrastructure failures a significant portion of the company’s software development personnel source code and computer equipment is located at operating facilities in the united states canada india and throughout europe the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unforeseen catastrophe at any of these facilities could cause interruptions in the company’s operations services and product development activities additionally if the company experiences problems that impair its business infrastructure such as a computer virus telephone system failure or an intentional disruption of its information technology systems by a third party these interruptions could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial position results of operations cash flows and the ability to meet financial reporting timelines further because the company’s sales are not generally linear during any quarterly period the potential adverse effects resulting from any of the events described above or any other disruption of the company’s business could be accentuated if it occurs close to the end of a fiscal quarter 

indebtedness incurred in connection with the acquisition of ansoft in partial consideration for the company’s 2008 acquisition of ansoft the company incurred longterm debt from committed bank financing of approximately 3550 million as of december 31 2008 remaining outstanding borrowings totaled 2790 million the incurrence of indebtedness among other things could make it difficult for the company to obtain any necessary future financing and make the company more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in its business if the company incurs new indebtedness in the future the related risks that it now faces could intensify whether the company is able to make required payments on its outstanding indebtedness and to satisfy any other future debt obligations will depend on its future operating performance and its ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing 

sales forecasts the company makes many operational and strategic decisions based upon short and longterm sales forecasts the company’s sales personnel continually monitor the status of all proposals including the estimated closing date and the value of the sale in order to forecast quarterly sales these forecasts are subject to significant estimation and are impacted by many external factors including global economic conditions and the performance of its customers a variation in actual sales activity from that forecasted could cause the company to plan or to budget incorrectly and therefore could adversely affect the company’s business financial position results of operations and cash flows the company’s management team forecasts macroeconomic trends and developments and integrates them through longrange planning into budgets research and development strategies 

  

and a wide variety of general management duties the current global economic conditions and the effect those conditions and the related disruptions in global credit markets have on the company’s customers may have a significant impact on the accuracy of the company’s sales forecasts these conditions may increase the likelihood or the magnitude of variations between actual sales activity and the company’s sales forecasts and as a result the company’s performance may be hindered because of a failure to properly match corporate strategy with economic conditions this in turn may adversely affect the company’s business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

income tax estimates the company makes significant estimates in determining its worldwide income tax provision these estimates involve complex tax regulations in a number of jurisdictions across the company’s global operations and are subject to many transactions and calculations in which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain the final outcome of tax matters could be different than the estimates reflected in the historical income tax provision and related accruals such differences could have a material impact on income tax expense and net income in the period in which such determination is made 

the amount of income tax paid by the company is subject to ongoing audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities these audits often result in proposed assessments the company’s estimate for liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions is highly judgmental and actual future results may result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to the company’s estimated tax liabilities including estimates for uncertain tax positions in the period the assessments are made or resolved audits are closed or when statutes of limitations on potential assessments expire as a result the company’s effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis 

the company allocates a portion of its purchase price to goodwill and intangible assets impairment charges associated with goodwill are generally not tax deductible and will result in an increased effective income tax rate in the period the impairment is recorded the company has recorded significant deferred tax liabilities related to acquired intangible assets that are not deductible for tax purposes these deferred tax liabilities are based on future statutory tax rates in the locations in which the intangible assets are recorded any future changes in statutory tax rates would be recorded as an adjustment to the deferred tax liabilities in the period the change is announced and could have a material impact on the company’s effective tax rate during that period 

periodic reorganization of sales force the company relies heavily on its direct sales force from time to time the company reorganizes and makes adjustments to its sales force in response to such factors as management changes performance issues market opportunities and other considerations these changes may result in a temporary lack of sales production and may adversely impact revenue in future quarters there can be no assurance that the company will not restructure its sales force in future periods or that the transition issues associated with such a restructuring will not recur 

regulatory compliance like all other public companies the company is subject to the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission “sec” including those that require the company to report on and receive an attestation from its independent registered public accounting firm regarding the company’s internal control over financial reporting compliance with these requirements causes the company to incur additional expenses and causes management to divert time from the daytoday operations of the company while the company anticipates being able to fully comply with these requirements if it is not able to comply with the sarbanesoxley reporting or attestation requirements relating to internal control over financial reporting the company may be subject to sanction by the sec or nasdaq such sanctions could divert the attention of the company’s management from implementing its business plan and could have an adverse effect on the company’s business and results of operation 

as the company’s stock is listed on the nasdaq global select market the company is subject to the ongoing financial and corporate governance requirements of nasdaq while the company anticipates being able to fully comply with these requirements if it is not able to comply the company’s name may be published on nasdaq’s daily noncompliant companies list until nasdaq determines that it has regained compliance 

  

or the company no longer trades on nasdaq if the company were unable to return to compliance with the governance requirements of nasdaq the company may be delisted from the nasdaq global select market which could have an adverse effect on the company’s ability to raise additional capital 

governmental revenue sources the company’s sales to the united states government must comply with the regulations set forth in the federal acquisition regulations failure to comply with these regulations could result in penalties being assessed against the company or an order preventing the company from making future sales to the united states government further the company’s international activities must comply with the export control laws of the united states the foreign corrupt practices act and a variety of other laws and regulations of the united states and other countries in which the company operates failure to comply with any of these laws and regulations could adversely affect the company’s business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

in certain circumstances the united states government state and local governments and their respective agencies and certain foreign governments may have the right to terminate these engagements at any time without cause the united states european union and certain other government contracts as well as our state and local level contracts are subject to the approval of appropriations or funding authorizations certain of these contracts permit the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions including but not limited to termination of contracts refund of a portion of fees received forfeiture of profits suspension of payments fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business any of which could have an adverse effect on the company’s results of operations and cash flows 

risks associated with significant sales to existing customers a significant portion of the company’s sales includes followon sales to existing customers that invest in the company’s broad suite of engineering simulation software and services if a significant number of current customers were to become dissatisfied with the company’s products and services or choose to license or utilize competitive offerings the company’s followon sales and recurring lease and maintenance revenues could be materially adversely impacted resulting in lower revenue operating margins net income and cash flows 

contingencies the company is involved in various investigations claims and legal proceedings from time to time that arise in the ordinary course of its business activities including alleged infringement of intellectual property rights commercial disputes employment matters tax audits and other matters each of these matters is subject to various uncertainties and it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could in the future materially affect the company’s results of operations cash flows or financial position 

changes in existing financial accounting standards or taxation rules changes in existing accounting or taxation rules or practices new accounting pronouncements or taxation rules or varying interpretations of current accounting pronouncements or taxation practices could have a significant adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or the manner in which the company conducts its business

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend overview 

ansys inc’s hereafter the “company” or “ansys” results for the year ended december 31 2008 reflect a revenue increase of 241 and basic and diluted earnings per share growth of 274 and 265 respectively as compared to 2007 these results were significantly impacted by the july 2008 acquisition of ansoft the results of operations include the results of ansoft for the period from the date of acquisition july 31 2008 through december 31 2008 the company experienced higher revenues in 2008 from both the ansoft acquisition and from license and maintenance growth in the company’s other products and services these revenues were partially offset by increased intangible amortization costs and increased operating expenses including higher salaries and related headcount costs as well as the additional costs associated with the ansoft business also in connection with the acquisition of ansoft on july 31 2008 the company borrowed 3550 million as of december 31 2008 these remaining outstanding borrowings totaled 2790 million the company’s financial position includes 2339 million in cash and shortterm investments and working capital of 1295 million as of december 31 2008 

ansys develops and globally markets engineering simulation software and services widely used by engineers and designers across a broad spectrum of industries including aerospace automotive manufacturing electronics biomedical energy and defense headquartered at southpointe in canonsburg pennsylvania the company and its subsidiaries employ approximately 1750 people as of december 31 2008 and focus on the development of open and flexible solutions that enable users to analyze designs directly on the desktop providing a common platform for fast efficient and costconscious product development from design concept to finalstage testing and validation the company distributes its ansys and ansoft suites of simulation technologies through a global network of independent channel partners and direct sales offices in strategic global locations it is the company’s intention to continue to maintain this mixed sales and distribution model 

the company licenses its technology to businesses educational institutions and governmental agencies growth in the company’s revenue is affected by the strength of global economies general business conditions currency exchange rate fluctuations customer budgetary constraints and the competitive position of the company’s products given the current global economic conditions and the increased strength of the us dollar relative to other currencies in which the company conducts transactions the company believes that there may be a future adverse impact on the company’s revenue streams and that these conditions may particularly impact the ansoft product line as ansoft has historically derived a significant portion of its total revenue from international sales please see the subsections entitled “adverse conditions in the global economy and disruption in financial markets” “decline in customers’ business” and “risks associated with international activities” under item 1a – risk factors above for a complete discussion of how these factors might impact the company’s financial condition and operating results the company believes that the features functionality and integrated multiphysics capabilities of its software products are as strong as they have ever been however the software business is generally characterized by long sales cycles these long sales cycles increase the difficulty of predicting sales for any particular quarter the company makes many operational and strategic decisions based upon short and longterm sales forecasts which are impacted not only by these long sales cycles but by current global economic conditions as a result the company believes that its overall performance is best measured by fiscal year results rather than by quarterly results please see the subsection entitled “sales forecasts” under item 1a – risk factors above for a complete discussion of the potential impact of the company’s sales forecasts on the company’s financial condition and operating results 

the company’s management considers the intense competition and price pressure that it faces in the short and long term by focusing on expanding the breadth depth ease of use and quality of the technologies features functionality and integrated multiphysics capabilities of its software products as compared to its competitors investing in research and development to develop new and innovative products and increase the capabilities of its 

  

existing products supplying new products and services focusing on customer needs training consultation and support and enhancing its distribution channels from time to time the company also considers acquisitions to supplement its product offerings and distribution channels

acquisitions 

on july 31 2008 the company completed its acquisition of ansoft a global provider of electronic design automation software under the terms of the merger agreement ansoft stockholders received 1625 in cash and 0431882 shares of ansys common stock for each outstanding ansoft share held on july 31 2008 ansys issued an aggregate of 1224 million shares of its common stock including 195 million shares pursuant to assumed stock options valued at approximately 4326 million based on the average closing market price on the two days preceding and the two days following the announcement of the acquisition and paid approximately 3873 million in cash the total purchase price of approximately 8239 million includes approximately 40 million in transaction fees the company used a combination of existing cash and proceeds from a 3550 million unsecured senior term loan credit facility to fund the transaction in addition to the 40 million in transactionrelated costs the company incurred financing costs of approximately 46 million related to the credit facility 

the operating results of ansoft have been included in the company’s consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition july 31 2008 the total purchase price was allocated to the foreign and domestic assets and liabilities of ansoft based upon management’s estimates of the fair market values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed the allocation included 2352 million to identifiable intangible assets including 984 million to developed software to be amortized over ten years 974 million to customer contracts and related relationships to be amortized over thirteen years and 394 million to trademark to be amortized over ten years and 6011 million to goodwill which is not amortized and not tax deductible the acquisition of ansoft enhanced the breadth functionality usability and interoperability of the combined ansys portfolio of engineering simulation solutions the acquisition is expected to increase operational efficiency and lower design and engineering costs for customers and accelerate development and delivery of new and innovative products to the marketplace 

in valuing deferred revenue on the ansoft balance sheet as of the acquisition date the company applied the fair value provisions of emerging issues task force issue no 013 “ accounting in a business combination for deferred revenue of an acquiree ” “eitf 013” in accordance with eitf no 013 acquired deferred revenue of 75 million was recorded on the opening balance sheet this amount was approximately 235 million lower than the historical carrying value although this purchase accounting requirement had no impact on the 

  

company’s business or cash flow the company’s reported revenue under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” primarily for the first 12 months postacquisition is less than would have been reported by ansoft absent the acquisition the impact on reported revenue for the year ended december 31 2008 was 17 million for lease license revenue and 130 million for maintenance revenue the expected impact on reported revenue for the year ending december 31 2009 is approximately 82 million 

the following table summarizes the preliminary fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition of ansoft 

 

 ansoft is in the process of preparing its tax returns for the year ended april 30 2008 and for the preacquisition period from may 1 2008 to july 31 2008 as a result the allocation of the purchase price is subject to refinement 

on may 1 2006 the company completed its acquisition of fluent inc “fluent” a global provider of computational fluid dynamics “cfd”based computeraided engineering software and services the acquisition of fluent enhanced the breadth functionality usability and interoperability of the company’s portfolio of simulation solutions under the terms of the merger agreement the company issued 11999896 shares of its common stock valued at approximately 274 million based on the average closing market price on the two days preceding and the two days following the announcement of the acquisition february 16 2006 and paid approximately 315 million in cash the total purchase price of approximately 598 million includes approximately 9 million in transaction fees the company used a combination of existing cash and 198 million from committed bank financing to fund the transaction in addition to the 9 million in transactionrelated costs the company incurred financing costs of 19 million related to the longterm debt utilized to fund the acquisition 

the operating results of fluent have been included in the company’s consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition may 1 2006 the total purchase price was allocated to the foreign and domestic assets and liabilities of fluent based upon management’s estimates of the fair market values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed the allocation included 2139 million to identifiable intangible assets including 880 million to developed software to be amortized over seven years 659 million to customer contracts and related relationships to be amortized over nine and a half years and 600 million to a nonamortizing trademark and 4043 million to goodwill which is not tax deductible the fluent trademark is one of the most recognized among cfd technologies the trademark represents a reputation of superior technical capability and strong support service that has been recognized by fluent customers because the trademark continues to gain strength in the marketplace today as evidenced by increased sales of ansys fluent software over the past several years the company had originally expected the trademark to contribute to cash flows indefinitely and accordingly had assigned an indefinite life to the trademark 

the company reconsidered the indefinite life associated with the fluent trademark as well as the trademark acquired in the 2003 acquisition of cfx as part of the product and naming strategy changes that occurred as a result of the july 31 2008 acquisition of ansoft and determined that these trademarks had a remaining useful life of ten years accordingly on july 31 2008 the company began amortizing these trademarks over a tenyear period during the third quarter of 2008 the company completed an impairment test for these trademarks and determined that these assets had not been impaired as of the test date july 31 2008 

  

in valuing deferred revenue on the fluent balance sheet as of the acquisition date the company applied eitf no 013 and acquired deferred revenue of 315 million was recorded on the opening balance sheet this amount was 201 million lower than the historical carrying value although this purchase accounting requirement had no impact on the company’s business or cash flow the company’s reported software license revenue under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states primarily for the first 12 months postacquisition was less than would have been reported by fluent absent the acquisition by 18 million for the year ended december 31 2007 and 184 million for the period of may 1 2006 through december 31 2006 there was no significant impact on reported revenue for the year ending december 31 2008 from the fluent acquisition as it relates to this purchase accounting requirement 

the following table summarizes the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition of fluent 

 

 the company expensed acquired inprocess research and development “iprd” of 281 million that represented incomplete fluent research and development projects that had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use as of the acquisition date 

technological feasibility is established when an enterprise has completed all planning designing coding and testing activities that are necessary to establish that a product can be produced to meet its design specifications including functions features and technical performance requirements the value assigned to iprd was determined by considering the importance of each project to the overall development plan estimating costs to develop the purchased iprd into commercially viable products estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects when completed and discounting the net cash flows to their present values based on the percentage of completion of the iprd projects during 2007 the company terminated the development of these projects 

during the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 the company made acquisition payments unrelated to ansoft or fluent of 119000 and 83 million respectively these amounts primarily relate to the 2005 acquisition of century dynamics inc and contingent consideration paid in 2007 and 2006 related thereto the 2006 payment also includes approximately 35 million related to the acquisition of certain independent channel partners 

  

results of operations 

the operating results of ansoft and fluent have been included in the results of operations since the acquisition dates of july 31 2008 and may 1 2006 respectively 

for purposes of the following discussion and analysis the table below sets forth certain consolidated financial data for the years 2008 2007 and 2006 

 

 year ended december 31 2008 compared to year ended december 31 2007 

revenue 

 

 the increase in software license revenue was the result of overall growth in both lease and perpetual license sales as well as the addition of ansoftrelated license revenue of 211 million for the period from the acquisition july 31 2008 through december 31 2008 

the increase in maintenance revenue was primarily the result of annual maintenance subscriptions sold in connection with new perpetual license sales in recent quarters and ansoftrelated maintenance revenue of 84 million for the period from the acquisition july 31 2008 through december 31 2008 

  

the decrease in service revenue was primarily the result of reduced revenue from engineering consulting services this decrease was partially offset by service revenue of 700000 related to the company’s 2008 biennial users’ conference 

with respect to revenue on average for the year ended december 31 2008 the us dollar was approximately 28 weaker when measured against the company’s primary foreign currencies than for the year ended december 31 2007 the us dollar weakened against the euro chinese renminbi swedish krona and the japanese yen while it strengthened against the british pound indian rupee and canadian dollar the net overall weakening throughout the year resulted in increased revenue and operating income during 2008 as compared with 2007 of approximately 55 million and 22 million respectively 

a substantial portion of the company’s license and maintenance revenue is derived from annual lease and maintenance contracts these contracts are generally renewed on an annual basis and have a high rate of customer renewal in addition to the recurring revenue base associated with these contracts a majority of customers purchasing new perpetual licenses also purchase related annual maintenance contracts as a result of the significant recurring revenue base the company’s license and maintenance revenue growth rate in any period does not necessarily correlate to the growth rate of new license and maintenance contracts sold during that period to the extent the rate of customer renewal for lease and maintenance contracts remains at current levels incremental lease contracts and maintenance contracts sold with new perpetual licenses will result in license and maintenance revenue growth 

the company’s revenue increased 241 and 462 in 2008 and 2007 respectively these growth rates are influenced by both the company’s organic growth rate incremental growth associated with acquired companies as well as the positive impact of currency fluctuations although the company’s overall revenue growth in 2009 will benefit from the inclusion of a full twelve months of ansoft operations as compared to five months of ansoft operations in 2008 the company is anticipating a reduction in the revenue growth rate of the nonansoft operations as compared to recent historical periods this slowing revenue growth is significantly impacted by the current disruption in domestic and global economies as well as by the company’s expectation that currency fluctuations will have an adverse impact on revenue growth in 2009 reductions in the company’s revenue growth rate are also expected to adversely impact the company’s operating income net income and earnings per share in 2009 

international and domestic revenues as a percentage of total revenue were 683 and 317 respectively during the year ended december 31 2008 and 658 and 342 respectively during the year ended december 31 2007 

in valuing deferred revenue on an acquired company’s balance sheet as of the acquisition date the company applied the fair value provisions of emerging issues task force issue no 013 “ accounting in a business combination for deferred revenue of an acquiree ” “eitf no 013” although this purchase accounting requirement had no impact on the company’s business or cash flow the company’s reported revenue under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states primarily for the first 12 months postacquisition is less than would have been reported by the acquired company absent the acquisition 

in accordance with eitf no 013 acquired deferred revenue of 75 million was recorded on the ansoft opening balance sheet this amount was approximately 235 million lower than the historical carrying value the impact on reported revenue for the year ended december 31 2008 was 17 million for lease license revenue and 130 million for maintenance revenue the expected impact on reported revenue for the year ending december 31 2009 is approximately 82 million 

acquired deferred revenue of 315 million was recorded on the fluent opening balance sheet this amount was 201 million lower than the historical carrying value the impact on reported revenue was 18 million for the year ended december 31 2007 there was no significant impact for the year ended december 31 2008 

  

cost of sales and gross profit 

 

 the change in cost of sales is primarily due to the following 

 

  

  

  

 the improvement in the gross profit was a result of the increase in revenue offset by a smaller increase in related cost of sales 

the company reconsidered the indefinite lives associated with certain trademarks as part of the product and naming strategy changes that occurred as a result of the july 31 2008 acquisition of ansoft the company determined that such trademarks had a remaining useful life of ten years and therefore amortization began july 31 2008 

operating expenses 

 

 selling general and administrative ansoftrelated selling general and administrative costs were 182 million for the period from the acquisition july 31 2008 through december 31 2008 nonansoft related expenses increased by 16 million during the year ended december 31 2008 which included increased stockbased compensation expenses of 17 million and increased salary costs of 14 million in addition third party commissions increased 10 million and facilities and information technology maintenance costs increased 

  

900000 as compared to the year ended december 31 2007 partially offsetting the increases in selling general and administrative costs were decreases in tax compliance costs of 18 million and incentive compensation of 17 million 

the company anticipates that it will make investments throughout 2009 in its global sales and marketing organization and its global business infrastructure to enhance major account sales activities and to support both its worldwide sales distribution and marketing strategies and the growth of the business in general 

research and development ansoftrelated research and development costs were 74 million for the period from the acquisition july 31 2008 through december 31 2008 nonansoft related expenses increased by 77 million during the year ended december 31 2008 which included increased salary costs of 41 million in addition stockbased compensation expense and consulting fees increased by 900000 and 800000 respectively as compared to the year ended december 31 2007 

the company has traditionally invested significant resources in research and development activities and intends to continue to make significant investments in this area particularly as it relates to ongoing integration and evolution of its portfolio of software technologies 

amortization ansoftrelated amortization expense was 21 million for the period from the acquisition july 31 2008 through december 31 2008 

interest expense the company’s longterm debt incurred interest expense including the amortization of debt financing costs of 93 million during the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to 65 million during the year ended december 31 2007 the interest expense on the term loans and amortization related to debt financing costs were as follows 

 

 the increased interest costs shown above for the 2008 period are primarily a result of a higher average outstanding debt balance partially offset by a lower weightedaverage effective interest rate of 472 as compared to 585 in the 2007 period the increased amortization costs shown above for 2008 are primarily a result of the early prepayment of the 2006 term loan as well as the additional amortization related to the 2008 term loan 

interest income expense net  interest income for the year ended december 31 2008 was 56 million as compared to 49 million for the year ended december 31 2007 interest income increased as a result of additional funds invested in the 2008 period as compared to the 2007 period 

other income expense net the company recorded other income of 727000 during the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to other expense of 600000 for the year ended december 31 2007 the net change was primarily the result of changes in foreign currency transaction gains and losses as the company’s presence in foreign locations continues to expand the company for the foreseeable future will have increased exposure to volatility of foreign exchange rates 

income tax provision the company recorded income tax expense of 550 million and had income before income taxes of 1667 million for the year ended december 31 2008 this represents an effective tax rate of 330 during the year ended december 31 2007 the company recorded income tax expense of 419 million and had income before income taxes of 1243 million the company’s effective tax rate was 337 for the year ended december 31 2007 

  

as compared to the federal and state combined statutory rate these rates are favorably impacted by lower tax rates in many of the company’s foreign jurisdictions section 199 manufacturing deductions and research and experimentation credits these rates are also impacted by charges or benefits associated with the company’s uncertain tax positions during the third quarter of 2008 the company filed its 2007 us federal and state income tax returns in conjunction with the completion of these returns the company adjusted its estimate for 2007 taxes to reflect the actual results and recorded a net tax benefit of 12 million the effect of this adjustment reduced the 2008 effective tax rate from 337 to 330 

net income the company’s net income for the year ended december 31 2008 was 1117 million as compared to net income of 824 million for the year ended december 31 2007 diluted earnings per share was 129 for the year ended december 31 2008 and 102 for the year ended december 31 2007 the weighted average shares used in computing diluted earnings per share were 868 million and 811 million during the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively 

year ended december 31 2007 compared to year ended december 31 2006 

revenue 

 

 the increases in software license revenue were the result of overall growth in both lease and perpetual license sales the impact of the fluent operations for a full twelve months in 2007 as compared to eight months in 2006 as well as an 184 million adverse impact on 2006 lease license revenue as compared to a 18 million adverse impact on 2007 related to purchase accounting adjustments to acquired deferred revenue see below 

the increase in maintenance revenue was primarily the result of annual maintenance subscriptions sold in connection with new perpetual license sales in recent quarters the increase in service revenue was primarily the result of increased revenue from engineering consulting services the increase in both maintenance and service revenue was also positively impacted by the inclusion of a full twelve months of fluent operations in 2007 as compared to eight months in 2006 

with respect to revenue on average for the year ended december 31 2007 the us dollar was approximately 69 weaker when measured against the company’s primary foreign currencies than for the year ended december 31 2006 the us dollar weakened against the british pound indian rupee euro chinese renminbi canadian dollar and swedish krona while it strengthened against the japanese yen the overall weakening resulted in increased revenue and operating income during 2007 as compared with 2006 of approximately 95 million and 32 million respectively 

international and domestic revenues as a percentage of total revenue were 658 and 342 respectively during the year ended december 31 2007 and 642 and 358 respectively during the year ended december 31 2006 

in accordance with eitf no 013 acquired deferred revenue of 315 million was recorded on the fluent opening balance sheet this amount was 201 million lower than the historical carrying value although this 

  

purchase accounting requirement had no impact on the company’s business or cash flow the company’s reported software license revenue under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states primarily for the first 12 months postacquisition was less than would have been reported by fluent absent the acquisition by 18 million for the year ended december 31 2007 and 184 million for the period of may 1 2006 through december 31 2006 

cost of sales and gross profit 

 



the increase in cost of sales was partially the result of a full year of fluent activity in 2007 as compared to eight months of fluent activity in 2006 the following variances also contributed to the increase 

 

  

  

  

 the increase in the gross profit was a result of the increase in revenue offset by a smaller increase in related cost of sales 

operating expenses 

 

 selling general and administrative the increase in selling general and administrative costs was a result of increased salary and headcountrelated costs including incentive compensation of 144 million additional stockbased compensation expense of 23 million increased professional fees including legal and accounting of 16 million additional third party commissions of 16 million increased operating and office lease expenses of 14 million and increased depreciation expense of 900000 the company also experienced increased tax compliance costs of 12 million and higher bad debt expense of 10 million these increases were partially impacted by the inclusion of a full year of fluent activity for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to eight months of activity for the year ended december 31 2006 

  

research and development salary and headcountrelated costs including incentive compensation increased by 39 million stockbased compensation expense increased by 700000 and the capitalization of internal labor costs decreased by 900000 as compared to the prior year in addition depreciation and maintenance costs increased 800000 and consulting costs increased 500000 these increases were partially impacted by the inclusion of a full year of fluent activity for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to eight months of activity for the year ended december 31 2006 

as a percentage of revenue research and development expenses declined during the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to 2006 this decline can primarily be attributed to two items research and development expenditures as a percentage of revenue have historically been lower for the fluent business than they have for the ansys business because 2007 contains more fluent operational activity than 2006 there is a reduction in the 2007 research and development expenditures as a percentage of revenue additionally there were certain development activities that existed in both the former ansys and fluent development organizations that were duplicative and through the integration efforts were rationalized in line with the future product direction during this rationalization process certain personnel that formerly existed in the research and development function were reassigned to other functions to maximize both efficiency and the related contribution to the strategy of the combined organization 

amortization fluentrelated amortization increased 25 million for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to the prioryear period the increase relates to twelve months of amortization expense in 2007 associated with certain acquired intangible assets as compared to eight months of amortization in the 2006 period 

inprocess research and development the nontax deductible charge in 2006 of 281 million represents the fair value assigned to incomplete fluent research and development projects that had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future value when acquired on may 1 2006 

interest expense the company’s longterm debt associated with the may 1 2006 acquisition of fluent incurred interest expense including the amortization of debt financing costs of 66 million during the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to 77 million for the year ended december 31 2006 the decrease in interest expense in 2007 was a result of lower interest rates and lower average debt balances outstanding 

other expense net other expense for the year ended december 31 2007 was 600000 as compared to other expense of 82000 for the year ended december 31 2006 for both 2007 and 2006 the company had foreign exchange losses of 700000 these amounts were partially offset by income from other nonoperating transactions of 100000 and 600000 in 2007 and 2006 respectively 

income tax provision the company recorded income tax expense of 419 million and had income before income taxes of 1243 million for the year ended december 31 2007 this represents an effective tax rate of 337 in 2007 the company recorded income tax expense of 189 million and had income before income taxes of 331 million for the year ended december 31 2006 this represents an effective tax rate of 572 

in connection with the may 1 2006 acquisition of fluent the company recorded a nontax deductible charge related to inprocess research and development of 281 million this nontax deductible charge increased the company’s effective tax rate from 309 to 572 for the year ended december 31 2006 because fluent’s operating results from the date of acquisition reflect a net loss that is primarily related to acquisitionrelated amortization and the purchase accounting adjustments to deferred revenue the related tax benefits on this loss have reduced the company’s overall effective tax rate during the year ended december 31 2006 the adoption of interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” “fin 48” adversely affected the 2007 income tax expense by 15 million and the effective tax rate by 12 the 2007 tax rate was also adversely affected by the phaseout of export benefits under the american jobs creation act and higher stockbased compensation costs from incentive stock options which include no tax benefit until the stock option is disqualified 

  

as compared to the federal and state combined statutory rate these rates are favorably impacted by domestic manufacturing deductions as well as research and experimentation credits additionally fluent has historically had an effective tax rate that has been higher than the company’s the effective tax rates in 2007 and 2006 were also impacted by the tax benefits discussed in the following paragraphs 

as indicated above in october 2004 the american jobs creation act of 2004 was signed into law and included replacement legislation for export benefits that the company previously received under the foreign sales corporation repeal and extraterritorial income exclusion act in 2007 export benefits were fully phased out in 2006 export benefits reduced the company’s effective tax rate by 45 the loss in export benefits during 2007 was partially replaced with an increased benefit for domestic production activities 

net income  the company’s net income for the year ended december 31 2007 was 824 million as compared to net income of 142 million for the year ended december 31 2006 the company’s 2006 net income was significantly impacted by the 281 million nontax deductible inprocess research and development charge related to the fluent acquisition in addition net income for 2007 includes a full year of activity related to fluent as compared to eight months of activity in 2006 diluted earnings per share was 102 for the year ended december 31 2007 and 019 for the year ended december 31 2006 the weighted average shares used in computing diluted earnings per share were 811 million and 764 million during the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively 

liquidity and capital resources 

as of december 31 2008 the company had cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaling 2339 million and working capital of 1295 million as compared to cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 1719 million and working capital of 1093 million at december 31 2007 the shortterm investments are generally investmentgrade and liquid which allows the company to minimize interest rate risk and to facilitate liquidity in the event an immediate cash need arises 

the company’s operating activities provided cash of 1967 million in 2008 1271 million in 2007 and 897 million in 2006 the net 696 million increase in operating cash flows for the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to the year ended december 31 2007 was primarily related to 

 

  

  

 the company’s cash flow from operations in 2008 and 2007 was positively impacted by 15 million and 89 million respectively as a result of the utilization of acquired net operating losses as of december 31 2008 the company has approximately 300000 of remaining net operating losses that were acquired as part of the ansoft transaction 

the 374 million increase in the company’s cash flow from operations in 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily the result of 682 million in increased net income partially offset by a 285 million decrease in working capital fluctuations and a 22 million decrease in other noncash operating adjustments which were most significantly impacted by the 281 million nontax deductible inprocess research and development charge related to the fluent acquisition 

  

the company’s investing activities used net cash of 3380 million for the year ended december 31 2008 and 154 million for the year ended december 31 2007 during 2008 the company had net acquisitionrelated cash outlays of approximately 3201 million related to the acquisition of ansoft total capital spending was 166 million in 2008 and 108 million in 2007 in 2008 purchases of shortterm investments exceeded maturities by 12 million and in 2007 the company purchased 44 million in net investments the company currently plans capital spending of approximately 100 million to 150 million during 2009 however the level of spending will be dependent upon various factors including growth of the business and general economic conditions 

the company’s investing activities used net cash of 154 million during 2007 and 2946 million during 2006 total capital spending was 108 million during 2007 and 70 million during 2006 in addition during 2006 the company paid 2966 million net of cash acquired for fluent in 2007 the company purchased 44 million in net investments and in 2006 maturing shortterm investments exceeded purchases by 180 million 

financing activities provided cash of 2178 million for the year ended december 31 2008 and used cash of 558 million for the year ended december 31 2007 the increase in cash provided was primarily a net result of 3550 million in borrowings associated with the acquisition of ansoft partially offset by principal payments of 1355 million related to the ansoft and fluent term loans 

the credit agreement associated with the acquisition of ansoft includes covenants related to the consolidated leverage ratio and the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio as well as certain restrictions on additional investments and indebtedness as of december 31 2008 the company is in compliance with all financial covenants as stated in the credit agreement 

financing activities used cash of 558 million for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared with cash provided of 1308 million for the year ended december 31 2006 this change of 1866 million was primarily the result of net borrowings of 1193 million in 2006 as compared to repayments of 632 million in 2007 

during the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 the company spent 100 million and 80 million respectively on stock repurchases no stock repurchases took place in 2006 

the company believes that existing cash and cash equivalent balances of 2282 million together with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet the company’s working capital capital expenditure and debt service requirements through fiscal year 2009 the company’s cash requirements in the future may also be financed through additional equity or debt financings there can be no assurance that such financings can be obtained on favorable terms if at all 

while the company is not directly exposed to the credit and liquidity risks associated with subprime lending adjustable rate mortgages or securities backed by these mortgages a decline in the financial stability across a significant component of the company’s customer base could hinder its ability to collect amounts due from customers which could result in increased bad debt expense and a decrease in cash generated from operations in addition the state of the financial markets could impact the company’s ability to obtain future funding 

the company continues to generate positive cash flows from operating activities and believes that the best use of its excess cash is to repay its longterm debt to grow the business and under certain favorable conditions to repurchase stock additionally the company has in the past and expects in the future to acquire or make investments in complementary companies products services and technologies as discussed under “acquisitions” in note 3 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements on july 31 2008 the company completed its acquisition of ansoft a global provider of electronic design automation software any future acquisitions may be funded by available cash and investments cash generated from operations existing or additional credit facilities or from the issuance of additional securities 

  

the company has a 21 million line of credit available on a company purchase card 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

the company does not have any special purpose entities or offbalance sheet financing 

contractual obligations 

the company’s significant contractual obligations as of december 31 2008 are summarized below 

 

  

        

the company expended 45 million 26 million and 18 million related to unconditional purchase obligations that existed as of the beginning of each year for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the company believes that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 

revenue is derived principally from the licensing of computer software products and from related maintenance contracts the company recognizes revenue in accordance with sop 972 “ software revenue recognition ” sop 989 “ modification of sop 972 software revenue recognition ” and related interpretations revenue from perpetual licenses is classified as license revenue and is recognized upon delivery of the licensed product and the utility that enables the customer to access authorization keys provided that acceptance has occurred and a signed contractual obligation has been received the price is fixed and determinable and collectibility of the receivable is probable the company determines the fair value of postcontract customer support “pcs” sold together with perpetual licenses based on separate sales of pcs revenue from pcs contracts is classified as maintenance and service revenue and is recognized ratably over the term of the contract 

revenue for software lease licenses is classified as license revenue and is recognized over the period of the lease contract typically the company’s software leases include pcs which due to the short term principally one year or less of the company’s software lease licenses cannot be separated from lease revenue for accounting purposes under the aicpa’s technical practice aid 510053 as a result both the lease license and pcs are recognized ratably over the lease period due to the shortterm nature of the software lease licenses and the frequency with which the company provides major product upgrades typically 12 – 18 months the company does not believe that a significant portion of the fee paid under the arrangement is attributable to the pcs component of the arrangement and as a result includes the revenue for the entire arrangement within software license revenue in the consolidated statements of income 

revenue from training support and other services is recognized as the services are performed the company applies the specific performance method to contracts in which the service consists of a single act such as providing a training class to a customer and the proportional performance method to other service contracts that are longer in duration and often include multiple acts for example both training and consulting in applying the proportional performance method the company typically utilizes outputbased estimates for services with contractual billing arrangements that are not based on time and materials and estimates output based on the total tasks completed as compared to the total tasks required for each work contract inputbased estimates are utilized for services that involve general consultations with contractual billing arrangements based on time and materials utilizing direct labor as the input measure 

the company also executes arrangements through channel partners in which the channel partners are authorized to market and distribute the company’s software products to end users of the company’s products and services in specified territories in sales facilitated by channel partners the channel partner bears the risk of collection from the end user customer the company recognizes revenue from transactions with channel partners when the channel partner submits a written purchase commitment collectability from the channel partner is probable a signed license agreement is received from the end user customer and delivery has occurred to the end user customer provided that all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied revenue for channel partner transactions is recorded on a net basis the amount actually received by the company from the channel partner the company does not offer right of return product rotation or price protection to any of its channel partners 

nonincome related taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are recorded on the balance sheet as accounts receivable and accrued expenses the collection and payment of these amounts is reported on a net basis in the consolidated statements of income and does not impact reported revenues or expenses 

  

the company warrants to its customers that its software will substantially perform as specified in the company’s most current user manuals the company has not experienced significant claims related to software warranties beyond the scope of maintenance support which the company is already obligated to provide and consequently the company has not established reserves for warranty obligations 

the company’s agreements with its customers generally require it to indemnify the customer against claims that the company’s software infringes third party patent copyright trademark or other proprietary rights such indemnification obligations are generally limited in a variety of industrystandard respects including the company’s right to replace an infringing product as of december 31 2008 the company had not experienced any losses related to these indemnification obligations and no claims with respect thereto were outstanding the company does not expect significant claims related to these indemnification obligations and consequently the company has not established any related reserves 

the company makes judgments as to its ability to collect outstanding receivables and provides allowances for a portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices from both value and delinquency perspectives for those invoices not specifically reviewed provisions are provided at differing rates based upon the age of the receivable and the geographical area of origin in determining these percentages the company considers its historical collection experience and current economic trends in the customer’s industry and geographic region if the historical data used to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and future results of operations could be materially affected 

the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period of the enactment date 

the company records net deferred tax assets to the extent it believes these assets will more likely than not be realized in making such determination the company considers all available positive and negative evidence including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and recent financial operations in the event the company determines that it would be able to realize deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be recorded that would reduce the provision for income taxes 

in july 2006 the fasb issued financial interpretation no 48 “ accounting for uncertainty in income taxes ” “fin 48” which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with sfas no 109 “ accounting for income taxes ” fin 48 provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits income tax positions must meet a morelikelythannot recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized upon the adoption of fin 48 and in subsequent periods this interpretation also provides guidance on measurement derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition fin 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 

the company adopted the provisions of fin 48 on january 1 2007 as a result of this adoption the company recognized approximately a 30 million increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits which was accounted for as a reduction to the january 1 2007 balance of retained earnings of 16 million and an increase to the january 1 2007 balance of goodwill of 14 million 

  

the company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the income tax expense line in the accompanying consolidated statements of income accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheet 

in december 2007 the fasb issued statement no 141r “ business combinations” “statement no 141r” statement no 141r establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree the statement also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination statement no 141r is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 the company expects statement no 141r will have an impact on its consolidated financial statements when effective but the nature and magnitude of the specific effects will depend upon the nature terms and size of the acquisitions consummated after the effective date of the 124 million liability for unrecognized tax benefits as of december 31 2008 53 million relate to tax positions of acquired entities taken prior to their acquisition by the company for those liabilities settled for lesser amounts prior to the adoption of statement no 141r the reversal of any remaining liability affected goodwill if such liabilities reverse subsequent to the adoption of statement no 141r such reversals will affect the income tax provision in the period of reversal 

the company tests goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment at least annually by comparing the fair value of each asset or in the case of goodwill the company’s reporting units to its carrying value fair value is estimated using the discounted cash flow and other valuation methodologies in preparing the estimate of fair value the company relies on a number of factors including historical operating results business plans anticipated future cash flows economic projections and other market data because there are inherent uncertainties involved in these factors the company’s estimates of fair value are imprecise and the resulting carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets may be misstated when the company assigns a fair value to a trademark it also estimates whether it has a finite or indefinite life thus impacting whether the value is amortized or not events such as product and naming strategy changes can occur whereby the company may reconsider the life whether finite or indefinite resulting in changes to amortization expense amortization periods may also be reconsidered with identifiable intangible assets with finite lives 

the company is involved in various investigations claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of its business activities the company reviews the status of these matters assesses its financial exposure and records a related accrual if the potential loss from an investigation claim or legal proceeding is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable significant judgment is involved in the determination of probability and in the determination of whether an exposure is reasonably estimable as a result of the uncertainties involved in making these estimates the company may have to revise its estimates as facts and circumstances change the revision of these estimates could have a material impact on the company’s financial position and results of operations 

the company grants options to purchase its common stock to employees and directors under the company’s stock option plan eligible employees can also purchase shares of the company’s common stock at a discount under the company’s employee stock purchase plan the benefits provided under these plans are sharebased payments subject to the provisions of statement no 123r effective january 1 2006 the company uses the fair value method to apply the provisions of statement no 123r with a modified prospective application which provides for certain changes to the method for valuing sharebased compensation 

the valuation provisions of statement no 123r apply to new awards and to awards that are outstanding on the effective date and subsequently modified or cancelled sharebased compensation expense for 2008 2007 and 2006 was 118 million 89 million and 56 million respectively as of december 31 2008 total unrecognized estimated compensation expense related to unvested stock options granted prior to that date was 315 million which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 20 years net stock options 

  

after forfeitures and cancellations granted during 2008 2007 and 2006 represented 126 109 and 247 respectively of outstanding shares as of the beginning of each fiscal year net stock options after forfeitures and cancellations granted during 2008 2007 and 2006 represented 110 107 and 205 respectively of outstanding shares as of the end of each fiscal year in addition during 2008 the company issued 195 million options pursuant to assumed stock options associated with the acquisition of ansoft representing 249 and 218 of outstanding shares as of the beginning and end of the current fiscal year respectively of the options issued associated with the acquisition 194 million were fully vested as of the acquisition date 

based on the requirements in statement no 123r the value of each sharebased award was estimated on the date of grant using the blackscholes option pricing model “blackscholes model” the determination of the fair value of sharebased payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by the company’s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables these variables include the company’s expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors riskfree interest rates and expected dividends the table below presents the assumptions used in calculating the compensation expense recorded within the company’s consolidated statements of income for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 the interest rates used were determined by using the fiveyear treasury note yield on the date of grant 

 

 the company issues both nonqualified and incentive stock options however incentive stock options comprise a significant portion of outstanding stock options the tax benefits associated with incentive stock options are unpredictable as they are predicated upon an award recipient triggering an event that disqualifies the award and that then results in a tax deduction to the company statement no 123r requires that these tax benefits be recorded at the time of the triggering event the triggering events for each option holder are not easily projected in order to estimate the tax benefits related to incentive stock options the company makes many assumptions and estimates including the number of incentive stock options that will be exercised during the period by us employees the number of incentive stock options that will be disqualified during the period and the fair market value of the company’s stock price on the exercise dates each of these items is subject to significant uncertainty additionally a significant portion of the tax benefits related to disqualified incentive stock options is accounted for as an increase to equity additional paidin capital rather than as a reduction in income tax expense although all such benefits continue to be realized through the company’s tax filings this accounting treatment has the effect of increasing tax expense and reducing net income for example the company realized a tax benefit of 34 million during the year ended december 31 2008 related to disqualified incentive stock options however only 152000 of such amount was recorded as a reduction in income tax expense although there are significant limitations in estimating stockbased compensation expense including those discussed above the company currently estimates that these costs will result in a decrease in 2009 operating income of approximately 13 million  14 million and a decrease in 2009 net income of approximately 10 million  11 million or approximately 011  012 per diluted share 

if factors change and the company employs different assumptions in the application of statement no 123r in future periods the compensation expense that the company will record under statement no 123r may differ significantly from what the company has recorded in the current period therefore it is important for investors to be aware of the high degree of subjectivity involved when using option pricing models to estimate sharebased compensation under statement no 123r option pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions are fully transferable and do not cause dilution because the company’s sharebased payments have characteristics significantly different from those of freely 

  

traded options and because changes in the input assumptions can materially affect the company’s estimates of fair values in the company’s opinion existing valuation models including the blackscholes models may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of the company’s sharebased compensation consequently there is a risk that the company’s estimates of the fair values of the company’s sharebased compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise expiration early termination or forfeiture of those sharebased payments in the future certain sharebased payments such as employee stock options may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in the company’s financial statements alternatively value may be realized from these instruments that is significantly in excess of the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in the company’s financial statements there is currently no marketbased mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models nor is there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values although the fair value of employee sharebased awards is determined in accordance with statement no 123r and the securities and exchange commission’s staff accounting bulletin no 107 “sab 107” using an option pricing model that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyerseller market transaction 

estimates of sharebased compensation expenses are significant to the company’s financial statements but these expenses are based on the aforementioned option valuation model and will never result in the payment of cash by the company for this reason and because the company does not view sharebased compensation as related to its operational performance the board of directors and management exclude estimated sharebased compensation expense when evaluating the company’s underlying business performance 

recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements 

in september 2006 the fasb issued statement no 157 “fair value measurements” “statement no 157” which is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 and for interim periods within those years this statement defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands the related disclosure requirements this statement is applicable to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements the statement indicates among other things that a fair value measurement assumes that the transaction to sell an asset or transfer a liability occurs in the principal market for the asset or liability or in the absence of a principal market the most advantageous market for the asset or liability statement no 157 defines fair value based upon an exit price model 

relative to statement no 157 the fasb issued fasb staff position “fsp” no 1572 “effective date of fasb statement no 157” fsp 1572 fsp 1572 delays the effective date of the application of statement no 157 to fiscal years beginning after november 15 2008 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis

interest expense rate risk  in connection with the fluent acquisition the company entered into two credit agreements as of may 1 2006 with variable interest rates and total borrowings of 198 million the amounts borrowed with respect to one of the credit agreements were paid in full as of december 31 2006 the amounts borrowed with respect to the second credit agreement were paid in full as of june 30 2008 

in connection with the ansoft acquisition the company entered into a 3550 million term loan with variable interest rates as of july 31 2008 the term loan is scheduled to mature on july 31 2013 and provides for tiered pricing with the initial rate at the prime rate  050 or the libor rate  150 with step downs permitted after the initial six months under the credit agreement down to a flat prime rate or the libor rate  075 such tiered pricing is determined by the ratio of the total debt of the company to the company’s earnings before interest expense taxes depreciation amortization and certain other items the credit agreement includes financial covenants tested quarterly requiring the company to maintain certain financial ratios and as is customary for facilities of this type certain events of default that permit the acceleration of the loan borrowings outstanding under this facility totaled 2790 million as of december 31 2008 

the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement on july 11 2008 with a forward swap date of august 7 2008 in order to hedge a portion of each of the first eight forecasted quarterly variable rate interest payments on the new term loan under the swap agreement the company receives the variable threemonth libor rate required under its term loan and pays a fixed libor interest rate of 332 on the notional amount the initial notional amount of 3000 million is amortized equally at an amount of 375 million over eight quarters through june 30 2010 

for the year ended december 31 2008 the company recorded interest expense related to the term loan of 77 million representing a weighted average interest rate of 472 if the company did not enter into the interest rate swap agreement the weighted average interest rate would have been 473 in addition the company recorded amortization related to debt financing costs of 15 million the interest expense on the term loans and amortization related to debt financing costs were as follows 

 



  

the interest rate for the july 31 2008 term loan is set for the first quarter of 2009 as follows 

 

 based on the effective interest rates and remaining outstanding borrowings at december 31 2008 the company’s interest expense on the term loan for the quarter ending march 31 2009 will be approximately 29 million a 050 increase in interest rates on the company’s borrowings would not impact the company’s interest expense for the quarter ending march 31 2009 based on the effective interest rates and remaining outstanding borrowings at december 31 2008 a 050 increase in interest rates would increase the company’s interest expense by approximately 321000 for the year ending december 31 2009 

foreign currency transaction risk the company’s recent acquisition of ansoft will increase its business presence in international locations particularly in the asiapacific region as the company continues to expand its business presence in international regions the portion of its revenue expenses cash accounts receivable and payment obligations denominated in foreign currencies continues to increase as a result changes in currency exchange rates from time to time may affect the company’s financial position results of operations and cash flows the company is most impacted by movements in and among the british pound euro japanese yen canadian dollar indian rupee swedish krona chinese renminbi korean won taiwan dollar and the us dollar 

with respect to revenue on average for the year ended december 31 2008 the us dollar was approximately 28 weaker when measured against the company’s primary foreign currencies than for the year ended december 31 2007 the us dollar weakened against the euro chinese renminbi swedish krona and the japanese yen while it strengthened against the british pound indian rupee and canadian dollar the overall weakening resulted in increased revenue and operating income during 2008 as compared with 2007 of approximately 55 million and 22 million respectively had the activity for the year ended december 31 2008 been recorded at the spot rates of each subsidiary’s functional currency as of december 31 2008 the revenue and operating income would have decreased 117 million and 35 million respectively 

the largest fluctuations and the most significant impact on revenue and operating income were primarily attributable to the euro british pound and japanese yen this is exhibited by the exchange rates provided in the charts below

employees of the company have signed agreements under which they have agreed not to disclose trade secrets or confidential information and where legally permitted that restrict engagement in or connection with any business that is competitive with the company anywhere in the world while employed by the company and in some cases for specified periods thereafter and that any products or technology created by them during their term of employment are the property of the company in addition the company requires all channel partners and resellers to enter into agreements not to disclose the company’s trade secrets and other proprietary information 

despite these precautions there can be no assurance that misappropriation of the company’s technology and proprietary information will not occur further there can be no assurance that copyright trademark patent and trade secret protection will be available for the company’s products in certain countries or that restrictions on the ability of employees and channel partners to engage in activities competitive with the company will be enforceable 

the software development industry is characterized by rapid technological change therefore the company believes that factors such as the technological and creative skills of its personnel new product developments frequent product enhancements name recognition and reliable product maintenance are also important to establishing and maintaining technology leadership in addition to the various legal protections of its technology that may be available 

the company does not believe that any of its products infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties there can be no assurance however that third parties will not claim such infringement by the company or its licensors or licensees with respect to current or future products the company expects that software suppliers will increasingly be subject to the risk of such claims as the number of products and suppliers continues to expand and the functionality of products continues to increase any such claims with or without merit could be time consuming result in costly litigation cause product shipment delays or require the company to enter into royalty or licensing agreements such royalty or licensing agreements if required may not be available on terms acceptable to the company 

seasonal variations 

the company’s business has experienced seasonality including quarterly reductions in software sales resulting from the slowdown during the summer months particularly in europe as well as from the seasonal purchasing and budgeting patterns of the company’s global customers 

backlog 

the company generally ships its products within 30 days after acceptance of an order and execution of a software license agreement accordingly the company does not believe that its backlog at any particular point in time is indicative of future sales levels 

employees

 item 1a risk factors tableend information provided by the company or its spokespersons including information contained in this annual report on form 10k may from time to time contain forwardlooking statements concerning projected financial performance market and industry sector growth product development and commercialization or other aspects of future operations such statements will be based on the assumptions and expectations of the company’s management at the time such statements are made the company cautions investors that its performance and therefore any forwardlooking statement is subject to risks and uncertainties various important factors including but not limited to the following may cause the company’s future results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statement 

potential fluctuations in operating results the company may experience significant fluctuations in future quarterly operating results fluctuations may be caused by many factors including but not limited to the timing of new product releases or product enhancements by the company or its competitors the size and timing of individual orders including a fluctuation in the demand for and the ability to complete large contracts software errors or other product quality problems competition and pricing changes customer order deferrals in anticipation of new products or product enhancements changes in demand for the company’s products changes in operating expenses changes in the mix of software license and maintenance and service revenue personnel changes and general economic conditions a substantial portion of the company’s operating expenses is related to personnel facilities and marketing programs the level of personnel and related expenses cannot be adjusted quickly and is based in significant part on the company’s expectation for future revenue the company does not typically experience significant order backlog further the company has often recognized a substantial portion of its revenue in the last month of a quarter with this revenue frequently concentrated in the last weeks or days of a quarter during certain quarterly periods the company has been dependent upon receiving large orders of perpetual licenses involving the payment of a single upfront fee and has shifted the business emphasis of its products to provide a collaborative solution to the company’s customers this emphasis has increased the company’s average order size and the related sales cycle time for the larger orders this shift may have the effect of increasing the volatility of the company’s revenue and profit from period to period as a result product revenue in any quarter is substantially dependent upon sales completed in the latter part of that quarter and revenue for any future quarter is not predictable with any significant degree of accuracy 

seasonal variations the company’s business has experienced seasonality including quarterly reductions in software sales resulting from the slowdown during the summer months throughout the world particularly in europe as well as from the seasonal purchasing and budgeting patterns of the company’s global customers 

economic slowdown in certain sectors the company’s sales are based significantly on end user demand for products in key industrial sectors many of these sectors periodically experience economic declines these economic declines may be exacerbated by other economic factors such as the recent increase in global energy prices these economic factors may adversely affect the company’s business by extending sales cycles and reducing revenue 

the company has customers that supply a wide spectrum of goods and services in virtually all of the world’s major economic regions the company’s performance is materially impacted by general economic conditions and the performance of its customers the company’s management team forecasts macroeconomic trends and developments and integrates them through longrange planning into budgets research and development strategies and a wide variety of general management duties when forecasting future economic trends and technological developments management does not have a comparative advantage to the extent that the company’s forecasts are in error by being overly optimistic or overly pessimistic about the performance of an economy or sector the company’s performance may be hindered because of a failure to properly match corporate strategy with economic conditions 

terrorist attacks other increased global hostilities and natural disasters have at times contributed to widespread uncertainty and speculation in the world financial markets this uncertainty and speculation may result in economic contraction and a related suspension or delay of purchasing by the company’s customers 

stock market and stock price volatility market prices for securities of software companies have generally been volatile in particular the market price of the company’s common stock has been and may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations as a result of factors affecting the company the software industry or the securities markets in general such factors include but are not limited to declines in trading price that may be triggered by the company’s failure to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors the company cannot provide assurance that in such circumstances the trading price of the company’s common stock will recover or that it will not experience a further decline moreover the trading price could be subject to additional fluctuations in response to quartertoquarter variations in the company’s operating results material announcements made by the company or its competitors conditions in the software industry generally or other events and factors many of which are beyond the company’s control 

  

rapidly changing technology new products risk of product defects the company operates in an industry generally characterized by rapidly changing technology and frequent new product introductions that can render existing products obsolete or unmarketable a major factor in the company’s future success will be its ability to anticipate technological changes and to develop and introduce in a timely manner enhancements to its existing products and new products to meet those changes if the company is unable to introduce new products and to respond quickly to industry changes its business financial position results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

the introduction and marketing of new or enhanced products require the company to manage the transition from existing products in order to minimize disruption in customer purchasing patterns there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing and marketing on a timely basis new products or product enhancements that its new products will adequately address the changing needs of the marketplace or that it will successfully manage the transition from existing products software products as complex as those offered by the company may contain undetected errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are released and the likelihood of errors is increased as a result of the company’s commitment to accelerating the frequency of its product releases there can be no assurance that errors will not be found in new or enhanced products after commencement of commercial shipments any of these problems may result in the loss of or delay in customer acceptance diversion of development resources damage to the company’s reputation or increased service and warranty costs any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

sales of new products the company continues to develop and introduce new software products certain of these products require a higher level of sales and support expertise the ability of the company’s sales channel particularly the indirect channel to obtain this expertise and to sell the new product offerings effectively could have an impact on the company’s sales in future periods additionally royalties and engineering service engagements associated with the new software products may result in the company’s cost of sales increasing as a percentage of revenue in future periods 

dependence on channel partners the company continues to distribute a meaningful portion of its products through its global network of independent regional channel partners the channel partners sell the company’s software products to new and existing customers expand installations within the existing customer base offer consulting services and provide the first line of technical support consequently in certain geographies the company is highly dependent upon the efforts of the channel partners difficulties in ongoing relationships with channel partners such as failure to meet performance criteria or to promote the company’s products as aggressively as the company expects and differences in the handling of customer relationships could adversely affect the company’s performance additionally the loss of any major channel partner for any reason including a channel partner’s decision to sell competing products rather than the company’s products could have a material adverse effect on the company moreover the company’s future success will depend substantially on the ability and willingness of its channel partners to continue to dedicate the resources necessary to promote the company’s portfolio of products and to support a larger installed base of the company’s products if the channel partners are unable or unwilling to do so the company may be unable to sustain revenue growth 

currently the company is partially protected from exchange rate fluctuations among the us dollar and other currencies as a result of its indirect thirdparty sales channel which generally pays the company in us dollars the revenues and expenses associated with the company’s international direct thirdparty sales channel are subject to foreign currency exchange fluctuations and as a result the company’s future financial results may be impacted by fluctuations in exchange rates additionally any future changes to the company’s sales channel involving proportionally higher direct sales from international locations could result in additional exposure to the foreign currency exchange fluctuations this exposure could adversely impact the company’s financial position and results of operations in future periods 

competition the company continues to experience intense competition across all markets for its products and services some of the company’s current and possible future competitors have greater financial technical marketing and other resources than the company and some have well established relationships with current and potential customers of the company these competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes price reductions andor increased operating costs and could result in lower revenues margins and net income 

dependence on senior management and key technical personnel the company is highly dependent upon the ability and experience of its senior executives and its key technical and other management employees the loss of these employees could adversely affect the company’s ability to conduct its operations 

  

risks associated with international activities a majority of the company’s business comes from outside the united states risks inherent in the company’s international business activities include imposition of government controls export license requirements restrictions on the export of critical technology products and services political and economic instability trade restrictions changes in tariffs and taxes difficulties in staffing and managing international operations longer accounts receivable payment cycles and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations effective patent copyright trademark and trade secret protection may not be available in every foreign country in which the company sells its products and services the company’s business financial position results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks 

as the company continues to expand its direct sales presence in international regions the portion of its revenue expenses cash accounts receivable and payment obligations denominated in foreign currencies continues to increase as a result changes in currency exchange rates from time to time may affect the company’s financial position results of operations and cash flows 

additionally countries in certain international regions have periodically experienced weaknesses in their currency banking and equity markets these weaknesses could adversely affect consumer demand for the company’s products and ultimately the company’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

as the company has grown it has become increasingly subject to the risks arising from adverse changes in domestic and global economic conditions an economic slowdown globally or regionally could cause many companies to delay or reduce technology purchases which could impact the company’s visibility into the closing of new business as opposed to its recurring business a slowdown could also contribute to reductions in sales longer sales cycles and increased price pressure each of these items could adversely affect the company’s sales in future periods 

the company has historically received significant tax benefits related to its export activities in october 2004 the american jobs creation act of 2004 was signed into law and included replacement legislation for existing export benefits the phaseout of the existing export benefits associated with the legislation is summarized as follows 

export benefit phaseout 

 

 in addition to repealing the export tax benefits the american jobs creation act of 2004 provides significant tax relief for domestic manufacturers effective for taxable years beginning after december 31 2004 qualifying entities may deduct a certain percentage as defined below of the lesser of their qualified production activities income or their taxable income for a taxable year the deduction however is limited to 50 of an employer’s w2 wages for the tax year beginning in 2010 when the 9 deduction is fully phased in corporations facing a marginal tax rate of 35 will be subject to an effective tax rate of 3185 on qualifying income 

manufacturing income deduction phasein 

 

 in 2007 export benefits were fully phased out in 2006 export benefits reduced the company’s effective tax rate by 45 the loss in export benefits during 2007 was partially replaced with an increased benefit for domestic production activities any other prospective changes regarding tax benefits associated with the company’s export sales or other federal and state tax planning vehicles may adversely impact the company’s effective tax rate and decrease its net income in future periods 

  

dependence on proprietary technology the company’s success is highly dependent upon its proprietary technology the company generally relies on contracts and the laws of copyright and trade secrets to protect its technology the company maintains a trade secrets program enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees and distributors and limits access to and distribution of its software documentation and other proprietary information there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company to protect its proprietary technology will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of its technology by third parties or that third parties will not be able to develop similar technology independently although the company is not aware that any of its technology infringes upon the rights of third parties there can be no assurance that other parties will not assert technology infringement claims against the company or that if asserted such claims will not prevail 

reliance on perpetual licenses although the company has historically maintained stable recurring revenue from the sale of software lease licenses software maintenance subscriptions and third party royalties it also has relied on sales of perpetual licenses that involve payment of a single upfront fee and that are more typical in the computer software industry while revenue generated from software lease licenses software maintenance subscriptions and third party royalties currently represents a portion of the company’s revenue to the extent that perpetual license revenue continues to represent a significant percentage of total revenue the company’s revenue in any period will depend increasingly on sales completed during that period 

risks associated with significant sales to existing customers a significant portion of the company’s sales includes followon sales to existing customers that invest in the company’s broad suite of engineering simulation software and services if a significant number of current customers were to become dissatisfied with the company’s products and services or choose to license or utilize competitive offerings the company’s followon sales and recurring lease and maintenance revenues could be materially adversely impacted resulting in lower revenue operating margins net income and cash flows 

risks associated with acquisitions the company has consummated and may continue to consummate certain acquisitions including the 2006 acquisition of fluent in order to support the company’s longterm strategic direction expand its customer base provide greater scale to increase its investments in research and development to accelerate innovation provide increased capabilities to its existing products supply new products and services or enhance its distribution channels in the future the company may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or if suitable candidates are identified the company may not be able to complete the business combination on commercially acceptable terms business acquisitions may result in devotion of significant management and financial resources 

in addition for companies acquired limited experience will exist for several quarters following the acquisition relating to how the acquired company’s sales pipelines will convert into sales or revenues and the conversion rate postacquisition may be quite different than the historical conversion rate because a substantial portion of the company’s software license revenue is completed in the latter part of a quarter and its cost structure is largely fixed in the short term revenue shortfalls may have a negative impact on the company’s profitability a delay in a small number of large new software license transactions could cause the company’s quarterly software license revenues to fall significantly short of its predictions 

acquisitions present many risks and the company may not realize the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of any transaction an acquisition program is an important element of the company’s corporate strategy the difficulties of integrating companies and acquired assets include among others 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the company expects to continue to acquire companies products services and technologies risks that may be encountered in acquisitions include 

 

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 these factors could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial position results of operations or cash flows particularly in the case of a larger acquisition or number of acquisitions 

disruption of operations or infrastructure failures a significant portion of the company’s software development personnel source code and computer equipment is located at operating facilities in the united states canada india and throughout europe the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unforeseen catastrophe at any of these facilities could cause interruptions in the company’s operations services and product development activities additionally if the company experiences problems that impair its business infrastructure such as a computer virus telephone system failure or an intentional disruption of its information technology systems by a third party these interruptions could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial position results of operations cash flows and the ability to meet financial reporting timelines further because the company’s sales are not generally linear during any quarterly period the potential adverse effects resulting from any of the events described above or any other disruption of the company’s business could be accentuated if it occurs close to the end of a fiscal quarter 

  

indebtedness incurred in connection with the acquisition of fluent inc in partial consideration for the company’s acquisition of fluent the company incurred longterm debt from committed bank financing of approximately 198 million as of december 31 2007 outstanding borrowings totaled 595 million this indebtedness is material in relation to prior levels of indebtedness as the company did not have any prior outstanding debt the incurrence of indebtedness among other things could 

 

  

  

 if the company incurs new indebtedness in the future the related risks that it now faces could intensify whether the company is able to make required payments on its outstanding indebtedness and to satisfy any other future debt obligations will depend on its future operating performance and its ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing 

periodic reorganization of sales force the company relies heavily on its direct sales force from time to time the company reorganizes and makes adjustments to its sales force in response to such factors as management changes performance issues market opportunities and other considerations these changes may result in a temporary lack of sales production and may adversely impact revenue in future quarters there can be no assurance that the company will not restructure its sales force in future periods or that the transition issues associated with such a restructuring will not recur 

third party royalty agreements the company has agreements with third parties whereby it receives royalty revenues in return for the right of the third party to utilize the company’s technology or embed the company’s technology in the third party’s products to the extent that the company is unable to maintain these third party relationships or that the third party is unsuccessful in selling the embedded products there could be a material adverse impact on the company’s business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

sales forecasts the company makes many operational and strategic decisions based upon short and longterm sales forecasts the company’s sales personnel continually monitor the status of all proposals including the estimated closing date and the value of the sale in order to forecast quarterly sales these forecasts are subject to significant estimation and are impacted by many external factors for example a slowdown in information technology spending or economic factors could cause purchasing decisions to be delayed a variation in actual sales activity from that forecasted could cause the company to plan or to budget incorrectly and therefore could adversely affect the company’s business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

income tax estimates the company makes significant estimates in determining its worldwide income tax provision these estimates involve complex tax regulations in a number of jurisdictions across the company’s global operations and are subject to many transactions and calculations in which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain the final outcome of tax matters could be different than the estimates reflected in the historical income tax provision and related accruals such differences could have a material impact on income tax expense and net income in the period in which such determination is made 

the amount of income tax paid by the company is subject to ongoing audits by federal state and foreign tax authorities these audits often result in proposed assessments the company’s estimate for liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions is highly judgmental and actual future results may result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to the company’s estimated tax liabilities including estimates for uncertain tax positions in the period the assessments are made or resolved audits are closed or when statutes of limitations on potential assessments expire as a result the company’s effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis 

the company allocates a portion of its purchase price to goodwill and intangible assets impairment charges associated with goodwill are generally not tax deductible and will result in an increased effective income tax rate in the period the impairment is recorded the company has recorded significant deferred tax liabilities related to acquired intangible assets that are not deductible for tax purposes these deferred tax liabilities are based on future statutory tax rates in the locations in which the intangible assets are recorded any future changes in statutory tax rates would be recorded as an adjustment to the deferred tax liabilities in the period the change is announced and could have a material impact on the company’s effective tax rate during that period 

  

nonincome based taxes as a multinational corporation the company is subject to nonincome based taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded withholding net worth property and goods and services taxes in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions the company is regularly under audit by tax authorities with respect to these nonincome taxes and may have exposure to additional nonincome tax liabilities relating to the underlying tax as well as potential interest and penalties if the company does not maintain compliance with the continuously changing rules and regulations acquisition activities increase the company’s nonincome tax exposures 

regulatory compliance like all other public companies the company is subject to the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission “sec” including those that require the company to report on and receive a certification from its independent accounting firm regarding the company’s internal controls compliance with these requirements causes the company to incur additional expenses and causes management to divert time from the daytoday operations of the company while the company anticipates being able to fully comply with these internal control requirements if it is not able to comply with the sarbanesoxley reporting or certification requirements relating to internal controls the company may be subject to sanction by the sec or nasdaq 

the company’s stock is listed on the nasdaq global select market thus the company is subject to the ongoing financial and corporate governance requirements of nasdaq while the company anticipates being able to fully comply with these requirements if it is not able to comply the company’s name may be published on nasdaq’s daily noncompliant companies list until nasdaq determines that it has regained compliance or the company no longer trades on nasdaq 

governmental revenue sources the company’s sales to the united states government must comply with the regulations set forth in the federal acquisition regulations failure to comply with these regulations could result in penalties being assessed against the company or an order preventing the company from making future sales to the united states government further the company’s international activities must comply with the export control laws of the united states the foreign corrupt practices act and a variety of other laws and regulations of the united states and other countries in which the company operates failure to comply with any of these laws and regulations could adversely affect the company’s business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

in certain circumstances the united states government state and local governments and their respective agencies and certain foreign governments may have the right to terminate these engagements at any time without cause there is increased pressure for governments and their agencies both domestically and internationally to reduce spending the united states european union and certain other government contracts are subject to the approval of appropriations similarly our contracts at the state and local levels are subject to government funding authorizations additionally government contracts may contain rights to audit and permit the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions including but not limited to termination of contracts refund of a portion of fees received forfeiture of profits suspension of payments fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business 

contingencies the company is involved in various investigations claims and legal proceedings from time to time that arise in the ordinary course of its business activities these proceedings currently include customary audit activities by various government authorities among other matters each of these matters is subject to various uncertainties and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to the company 

changes in existing financial accounting standards or taxation rules changes in existing accounting or taxation rules or practices new accounting pronouncements or taxation rules or varying interpretations of current accounting pronouncements or taxation practices could have a significant adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or the manner in which the company conducts its business further such changes could potentially affect the company’s reporting of transactions completed before such changes are effective for example the company was not previously required to record stockbased compensation charges to earnings in connection with stock option grants to its employees however the fasb issued a revised version of fasb statement no 123 “ sharebased payment ” “statement no 123r” that requires the company to record stockbased compensation charges to earnings as of january 1 2006 such charges negatively impacted the company’s earnings 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to certain market risks primarily foreign currency exchange rates that arise from transactions occurring in the normal course of business the company seeks to reduce these risks primarily through its normal operating and financing activities 

  

financial market risk  recently the financial markets have experienced a decline as a result of the us subprime mortgage market crisis while the company is not directly exposed to the credit and liquidity risks associated with subprime lending adjustable rate mortgages or securities backed by these mortgages a decline in the financial stability across a significant component of the company’s customer base could hinder its ability to collect amounts due from customers and could result in lower demand for the company’s products in addition the state of the financial markets could impact the company’s ability to obtain future funding

on may 1 2006 the company completed its acquisition of fluent inc “fluent” a global provider of computational fluid dynamics “cfd”based computeraided engineering software and services the acquisition of fluent enhances the breadth functionality usability and interoperability of the company’s portfolio of simulation solutions under the terms of the merger agreement the company issued 11999896 shares of its common stock valued at approximately 274 million based on the average closing market price on the two days preceding and the two days following the announcement of the acquisition february 16 2006 and paid approximately 315 million in cash to acquire fluent the total purchase price of approximately 598 million includes approximately 9 million in transaction fees the company used a combination of existing cash and 198 million from committed bank financing to fund the transaction in addition to the 9 million in transactionrelated costs the company incurred financing costs of 19 million related to the longterm debt utilized to fund the acquisition 

the operating results of fluent have been included in the company’s consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition may 1 2006 the total purchase price was allocated to the foreign and domestic assets and liabilities of fluent based upon management’s estimates of the fair market values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed the allocation included 2139 million to identifiable intangible assets including 880 million to developed software to be amortized over seven years 659 million to customer contracts and related relationships to be amortized over nine and a half years and 600 million to trade name and 4043 million to goodwill which is not tax deductible the fluent trade name is one of the most recognized among cfd technologies the trade name represents a reputation of superior technical capability and strong support service that has been recognized by fluent customers because the trade name continues to gain strength in the marketplace today as evidenced by increased sales of ansys fluent software over the past several years the company expects the trade name to contribute to cash flows indefinitely and accordingly has assigned an indefinite life to the trade name 

in valuing deferred revenue on the fluent balance sheet as of the acquisition date the company applied the fair value provisions of emerging issues task force issue no 013 “eitf no 013” “ accounting in a business combination for deferred revenue of an acquiree ” in accordance with eitf no 013 acquired deferred revenue of 315 million was recorded on the opening balance sheet this amount was 201 million lower than the historical carrying value by fluent although this purchase accounting requirement had no impact on the company’s business or cash flow the company’s reported software license revenue under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” primarily for the first 12 months postacquisition was less than would have been reported by fluent absent the acquisition by 18 million for the year ended december 31 2007 and 184 million for the period of may 1 2006 through december 31 2006 there will be no significant impact on reported revenue for the year ending december 31 2008 from the fluent acquisition as it relates to this purchase accounting requirement 

the following table summarizes the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition 

 

   

the company expensed acquired inprocess research and development “iprd” of 281 million that represents incomplete fluent research and development projects that had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use as of the acquisition date 

technological feasibility is established when an enterprise has completed all planning designing coding and testing activities that are necessary to establish that a product can be produced to meet its design specifications including functions features and technical performance requirements the value assigned to iprd was determined by considering the importance of each project to the overall development plan estimating costs to develop the purchased iprd into commercially viable products estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects when completed and discounting the net cash flows to their present values based on the percentage of completion of the iprd projects during 2007 the company terminated the development of these projects 

the following unaudited pro forma information presents the 2006 and 2005 results of operations of the company as if the acquisition had occurred at the beginning of each period the unaudited pro forma results are not necessarily indicative of results that would have occurred had the acquisition been in effect for the years presented nor are they necessarily indicative of future results these pro forma results exclude the impacts of iprd expense and the purchase accounting adjustment to deferred revenue that were previously discussed 

 

 results of operations 

the operating results of fluent have been included in the results of operations since the acquisition date of may 2006 

for purposes of the following discussion and analysis the table below sets forth certain consolidated financial data for the years 2007 2006 and 2005 

 

   

year ended december 31 2007 compared to year ended december 31 2006 

revenue  

 

 software license revenue increased as follows 

 

  

 the increases in software license revenue were the result of overall growth in both lease and perpetual license sales the impact of the fluent operations for a full twelve months in 2007 as compared to eight months in 2006 as well as an 184 million adverse impact on 2006 lease license revenue as compared to a 18 million adverse impact on 2007 related to purchase accounting adjustments to acquired deferred revenue see below 

maintenance and service revenue increased as follows 

 

  

 the increase in maintenance revenue was primarily the result of annual maintenance subscriptions sold in connection with new perpetual license sales in recent quarters the increase in service revenue was primarily the result of increased revenue from engineering consulting services the increases in both maintenance and service revenue were also positively impacted by the inclusion of a full twelve months of fluent operations in 2007 as compared to eight months in 2006 

with respect to revenue on average for the year ended december 31 2007 the us dollar was approximately 69 weaker when measured against the company’s primary foreign currencies than for the year ended december 31 2006 the us dollar weakened against the british pound the indian rupee the euro the chinese renminbi the canadian dollar and the swedish krona while it strengthened against the japanese yen the overall weakening resulted in increased revenue and operating income during 2007 as compared with 2006 of approximately 95 million and 32 million respectively 

a substantial portion of the company’s license and maintenance revenue is derived from annual lease and maintenance contracts these contracts are generally renewed on an annual basis and have a high rate of customer renewal in addition to the recurring revenue base associated with these contracts a majority of customers purchasing new perpetual licenses also purchase related annual maintenance contracts as a result of the significant recurring revenue base the company’s license and maintenance revenue growth rate in any period does not necessarily correlate to the growth rate of new license and maintenance contracts sold during that period to the extent the rate of customer renewal for lease and maintenance contracts remains at current levels incremental lease contracts and maintenance contracts sold with new perpetual licenses will result in license and maintenance revenue growth 

international and domestic revenues as a percentage of total revenue were 658 and 342 respectively during the year ended december 31 2007 and 642 and 358 respectively during the year ended december 31 2006 

in accordance with eitf no 013 acquired deferred revenue of 315 million was recorded on the fluent opening balance sheet this amount was 201 million lower than the historical carrying value by fluent although this purchase accounting requirement had no impact on the company’s business or cash flow the company’s reported software license revenue under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” primarily for the first 12 months postacquisition was less than would have been reported by fluent absent the acquisition by 18 million for the year ended december 31 2007 and 184 million for the period of may 1 2006 through december 31 2006 

  

cost of sales and gross profit  

 

 the change in cost of sales is primarily due to the variances detailed below these variances were partially a result of a full year of fluent activity in 2007 as compared to eight months of activity in the prior year 

 

  

  

 the increase in the gross profit was a result of the increase in revenue offset by a smaller increase in related cost of sales 

operating expenses  

 

 selling general and administrative  the increase in selling general and administrative costs was a result of increased salary and headcountrelated costs including incentive compensation of 144 million additional stockbased compensation expense of 23 million increased professional fees including legal and accounting of 16 million additional third party commissions of 16 million increased operating and office lease expense of 14 million and depreciation expense of 900000 the company also experienced increased tax compliance costs of 12 million and higher bad debt expense of 10 million these increases were partially impacted by the inclusion of a full year of activity for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to eight months of fluent activity for the year ended december 31 2006 

the company anticipates that it will make investments throughout 2008 in its global sales and marketing organization and its global business infrastructure to enhance major account sales activities and to support both its worldwide sales distribution and marketing strategies and the growth of the business in general 

  

research and development  salary and headcountrelated costs including incentive compensation increased by 39 million stockbased compensation expense increased by 700000 and the capitalization of internal labor costs decreased by 900000 as compared to the prior year in addition depreciation and maintenance costs increased 800000 and consulting costs increased 500000 these increases were partially impacted by the inclusion of a full year of fluent activity for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to eight months of activity for the year ended december 31 2006 

as a percentage of revenue research and development expenses declined during the year ended december 31 2007 compared to 2006 this decline can primarily be attributed to two items research and development expenditures as a percentage of revenue have historically been lower for the fluent business than they have for the ansys business because 2007 contains more fluent operational activity than 2006 there is a reduction in the 2007 research and development expenditures as a percentage of revenue additionally there were certain development activities that existed in both the former ansys and fluent development organizations that were duplicative and through the integration efforts have been rationalized in line with the future product direction during this rationalization process certain personnel that formerly existed in the research and development function were reassigned to other functions to maximize both efficiency and the related contribution to the strategy of the combined organization 

the company has traditionally invested significant resources in research and development activities and intends to continue to make significant investments in this area particularly as it relates to ongoing integration and evolution of its portfolio of software technologies 

amortization  fluentrelated amortization increased 25 million for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to the prioryear period the increase relates to twelve months of amortization expense in 2007 associated with certain acquired intangible assets as compared to eight months of amortization in the 2006 period 

inprocess research and development  the nontax deductible charge in 2006 of 281 million represents the fair value assigned to incomplete fluent research and development projects that had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future value when acquired on may 1 2006 

interest expense  in connection with the acquisition of fluent on may 1 2006 the company borrowed 198 million and assumed certain capital leases these borrowings incurred interest expense including the amortization of debt financing costs of 66 million during the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to 77 million for the year ended december 31 2006 the decrease in interest expense in 2007 was a result of lower interest rates and lower average debt balances outstanding 

other expense net  other expense for the year ended december 31 2007 was 600000 as compared to other expense of 82000 for the year ended december 31 2006 the net increase in expense was a result of the following two factors 

foreign currency transaction – for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 the company had a net foreign exchange loss of 700000 during 2007 the us dollar weakened against the british pound indian rupee euro canadian dollar swedish krona japanese yen and the chinese renminbi as the company’s presence in foreign locations continues to expand the company for the foreseeable future will have increased exposure to volatility of foreign exchange rates the company is most impacted by movements among and between the british pound euro canadian dollar japanese yen indian rupee swedish krona chinese renminbi and the us dollar 

other – income from other nonoperating transactions decreased 500000 during the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to the year ended december 31 2006 

income tax provision  the company recorded income tax expense of 419 million and had income before income tax provision of 1243 million for the year ended december 31 2007 this represents an effective tax rate of 337 in 2007 the company recorded income tax expense of 189 million and had income before income tax provision of 331 million for the year ended december 31 2006 this represents an effective tax rate of 572 in connection with the may 1 2006 acquisition of fluent the company recorded a nontax deductible charge related to inprocess research and development of 281 million this nontax deductible charge increased the company’s effective tax rate from 309 to 572 for the year ended december 31 2006 because fluent’s operating results from the date of acquisition reflect a net loss that is primarily related to acquisitionrelated amortization and the purchase accounting adjustments to deferred revenue the related tax benefits on this loss have reduced the company’s overall effective tax rate during the year ended december 31 2006 the adoption of interpretation no 48 “ accounting for uncertainty in income taxes ” “fin 48” adversely affected the 2007 income tax expense by 15 million and the effective tax rate by 12 the 2007 tax rate was also adversely affected by the phaseout of export benefits under the american jobs creation act and higher stockbased compensation costs from incentive stock options which include no tax benefit until the stock option is disqualified 

  

as compared to the federal and state combined statutory rate these rates are favorably impacted by domestic manufacturing deductions as well as research and experimentation credits additionally fluent has historically had an effective tax rate that has been higher than the company’s the effective tax rates in 2007 and 2006 were also impacted by the tax benefits discussed in the following paragraphs 

in october 2004 the american jobs creation act of 2004 was signed into law and included replacement legislation for export benefits that the company previously received under the foreign sales corporation repeal and extraterritorial income exclusion act the phaseout of export benefits associated with the legislation is summarized as follows 

 

 in addition to repealing the export tax benefits the american jobs creation act of 2004 provides significant tax relief for domestic manufacturers effective for taxable years beginning after december 31 2004 qualifying entities may deduct a certain percentage as defined below of the lesser of their qualified production activities income or their taxable income for a taxable year the deduction however is limited to 50 of an employer’s w2 wages for the tax year beginning in 2010 when the 9 deduction is fully phased in corporations facing a marginal tax rate of 35 will be subject to an effective tax rate of 3185 on qualifying income 

 

 in 2007 export benefits were fully phased out in 2006 export benefits reduced the company’s effective tax rate by 45 the loss in export benefits during 2007 was partially replaced with an increased benefit for domestic production activities any other prospective changes regarding tax benefits associated with the company’s export sales or other federal and state tax planning vehicles may adversely impact the company’s effective tax rate and decrease its net income in future periods 

the company makes significant estimates in determining its worldwide income tax provision these estimates involve complex tax regulations in a number of jurisdictions across the company’s global operations and are subject to many transactions and calculations in which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain although the company believes that its estimates are reasonable the final outcome of tax matters could be different than the estimates reflected in the historical income tax provision and related accruals such differences could have a material impact on income tax expense and net income in the period in which such determination is made 

net income  the company’s net income for the year ended december 31 2007 was 824 million or 102 diluted earnings per share as compared to net income of 142 million or 019 diluted earnings per share in 2006 the company’s 2006 net income was significantly impacted by the 281 million nontax deductible inprocess research and development charge related to the fluent acquisition in addition net income for 2007 includes a full year of activity related to fluent as compared to eight months of activity in 2006 the weighted average common and common equivalent shares used in computing diluted earnings per share were 811 million in 2007 and 764 million in 2006 

  

year ended december 31 2006 compared to year ended december 31 2005 

revenue  

 

 software license revenue increased as follows 

 

  

 the increases in 2006 software license revenue were the result of fluentrelated software license revenue of 543 million for the period from the acquisition may 1 2006 through december 31 2006 and newly generated software license revenue of 170 million including 33 million related to an order with a longstanding major customer 

maintenance and service revenue increased as follows 

 

  

 the increase in maintenance was primarily the result of 118 million in fluentrelated revenue for the period from the acquisition may 1 2006 through december 31 2006 and a 92 million increase in maintenance revenue primarily associated with annual maintenance subscriptions sold in connection with new perpetual license sales in recent quarters the increase in service revenue was primarily impacted by 131 million in fluentrelated revenue and 600000 related to the 2006 biennial ansys users’ conference 

on average for the year ended december 31 2006 the us dollar was 10 weaker when measured against the company’s primary foreign currencies than for the year ended december 31 2005 the us dollar weakened against the british pound euro canadian dollar swedish krona and chinese renminbi while it strengthened against the indian rupee and japanese yen these fluctuations resulted in a 600000 increase in revenue and a 100000 decrease in operating income during 2006 as compared with 2005 

international and domestic revenues as a percentage of total revenue were 642 and 358 respectively during the year ended december 31 2006 and 668 and 332 respectively during the year ended december 31 2005 

as previously mentioned in accordance with eitf no 013 acquired deferred revenue of 315 million was recorded on the fluent opening balance sheet this amount was 201 million lower than the historical carrying value by fluent although this purchase accounting requirement had no impact on the company’s business or cash flow the company’s reported software license revenue under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” primarily for the first 12 months postacquisition was less than would have been reported by fluent absent the acquisition by 184 million for the period of may 1 2006 through december 31 2006 

  

cost of sales and gross profit  

 

 the change in cost of sales is primarily due to the following 

 

  

  

 the increase in the gross profit was a result of the increase in revenue offset by a smaller increase in related cost of sales the decrease in gross profit percentage was a result of higher amortization expense associated with the acquisition of fluent as well as increased maintenance and service costs associated with fluent’s technical support and engineering services business 

operating expenses  

 

 selling general and administrative  fluentrelated selling general and administrative costs were 358 million for the period from the acquisition may 1 2006 through december 31 2006 expenses increased 40 million in 2006 as compared to 2005 as a result of stockbased compensation expense associated with the 2006 adoption of statement no 123r salary and headcountrelated costs including incentive compensation increased by 32 million during the year ended december 31 2006 as compared to the year ended december 31 2005 additionally the cost relating to the biennial ansys users’ conference during 2006 was 550000 

  

research and development  fluentrelated research and development costs were 126 million for the period from the acquisition may 1 2006 through december 31 2006 salary and headcountrelated costs including incentive compensation increased by 47 million during the year ended december 31 2006 as compared to 2005 expenses increased 14 million as a result of stockbased compensation expense associated with the 2006 adoption of statement no 123r 

amortization  fluentrelated amortization was 59 million for the period from the acquisition may 1 2006 through december 31 2006 amortization unrelated to fluent decreased by 900000 as a result of certain customer lists and noncompete agreements that became fully amortized this decrease was offset by amortization associated with noncompete agreements related to other business acquisitions completed during 2006 of 100000 

inprocess research and development  this nontax deductible charge represents the fair value assigned to incomplete fluent research and development projects that had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future value when acquired on may 1 2006 

interest expense  interest expense for the year ended december 31 2006 was 78 million in connection with the acquisition of fluent on may 1 2006 the company borrowed 198 million and assumed certain capital leases these borrowings incurred interest expense including the amortization of debt financing costs of 77 million during the period from the date of acquisition may 1 2006 through december 31 2006 

interest income  interest income for the year ended december 31 2006 was 48 million compared to 43 million for the year ended december 31 2005 the increase is primarily associated with interest income from fluent of 400000 

other expense income net  other expense for the year ended december 31 2006 was 82000 as compared to other expense of 23000 for the year ended december 31 2005 the net increase in other expense was the result of the following two factors 

foreign currency transaction – during 2006 the company had a net foreign exchange loss of 700000 as compared with a loss of 200000 in 2005 during 2006 the us dollar weakened against the british pound canadian dollar euro swedish krona and chinese renminbi while it strengthened against the indian rupee and japanese yen as the company’s presence in foreign locations continues to expand the company for the foreseeable future will have increased exposure to volatility of foreign exchange rates 

other – income from other nonoperating transactions increased 400000 during the year ended december 31 2006 as compared to the year ended december 31 2005 

income tax provision  the company recorded income tax expense of 189 million and had income before income tax provision of 331 million for the year ended december 31 2006 this represents an effective tax rate of 572 in connection with the may 1 2006 acquisition of fluent the company recorded a nontax deductible charge related to inprocess research and development of 281 million this nontax deductible charge increased the company’s effective tax rate from 309 to 572 for the year ended december 31 2006 as compared to 304 for the year ended december 31 2005 these rates are lower than the federal and state combined statutory rate as a result of export benefits as well as the generation of research and experimentation credits additionally fluent has historically had an effective tax rate that has been higher than the company’s because fluent’s operating results from the date of acquisition reflect a net loss that is primarily related to acquisitionrelated amortization and the purchase accounting adjustments to deferred revenue the related tax benefits on this loss have reduced the company’s overall effective tax rate during the year ended december 31 2006 

  

net income  the company’s net income for the year ended december 31 2006 was 142 million or 019 diluted earnings per share as compared to net income of 439 million or 065 diluted earnings per share in 2005 the company’s net income was significantly impacted by the 281 million nontax deductible inprocess research and development charge related to the fluent acquisition the weighted average common and common equivalent shares used in computing diluted earnings per share were 764 million in 2006 and 674 million in 2005 

liquidity and capital resources 

as of december 31 2007 the company had cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaling 1719 million and working capital of 1093 million as compared to cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 1045 million and working capital of 364 million at december 31 2006 the shortterm investments are generally investmentgrade and liquid which allows the company to minimize interest rate risk and to facilitate liquidity in the event an immediate cash need arises 

the company’s operating activities provided cash of 1271 million in 2007 897 million in 2006 and 678 million in 2005 the net 374 million increase in operating cash flows for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to the year ended december 31 2006 was primarily related to 

 

  

  

 the company’s cash flow from operations in 2007 2006 and 2005 was positively impacted by 89 million 62 million and 200000 respectively as a result of the utilization of acquired net operating losses as of december 31 2007 remaining acquired net operating losses total approximately 42 million and are expected to positively impact the company’s 2008 cash flow from operations by approximately 15 million 

the 219 million increase in the company’s cash flow from operations in 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily the result of 104 million in increased earnings adjusted for noncash expenses such as depreciation amortization inprocess research and development and deferred income taxes and 114 million in working capital fluctuations 

the company’s investing activities used net cash of 154 million for the year ended december 31 2007 and 2946 million for the year ended december 31 2006 total capital spending was 108 million in 2007 and 70 million in 2006 in addition during 2006 the company paid 2966 million net of cash acquired for fluent and had other acquisitionrelated cash outlays of approximately 83 million in 2007 the company purchased 44 million in net investments and in 2006 maturing shortterm investments exceeded related purchases by 180 million the company currently plans capital spending of approximately 130 million to 160 million during 2008 however the level of spending will be dependent upon various factors including growth of the business and general economic conditions 

the company’s investing activities used net cash of 2946 million during 2006 as compared with cash provided of 282 million during 2005 during 2006 the company paid 2966 million net of cash acquired for fluent net cash provided by maturities in excess of shortterm investment purchases was 180 million and 373 million during 2006 and 2005 respectively total capital spending was 70 million during 2006 and 45 million during 2005 business acquisition payments unrelated to fluent increased from 44 million in 2005 to 83 million in 2006 the 2006 payments include 35 million related to acquisitions of certain independent channel partner businesses 

financing activities used cash of 558 million in the year ended december 31 2007 and provided cash of 1308 million in the year ended december 31 2006 this change of 1866 million was primarily a result of net borrowings of 1193 million in 2006 as compared to repayments of 632 million in 2007 the company also spent 8 million on stock repurchases in 2007 

financing activities provided cash of 1308 million for the year ended december 31 2006 as compared with cash used of 15 million during the year ended december 31 2005 this increase in cash provided was primarily a result of net borrowings of 1193 million in 2006 in addition tax benefits of 52 million related to stockbased compensation were reported in cash flows from financing activities during 2006 in 2005 these benefits were reported within cash flows from operating activities 

  

the company believes that existing cash and cash equivalent balances of 1672 million together with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet the company’s working capital capital expenditure and debt service requirements through fiscal 2008 the company’s cash requirements in the future may also be financed through additional equity or debt financings there can be no assurance that such financings can be obtained on favorable terms if at all 

while the company is not directly exposed to the credit and liquidity risks associated with subprime lending adjustable rate mortgages or securities backed by these mortgages a decline in the financial stability across a significant component of the company’s customer base could hinder its ability to collect amounts due from customers which could result in a decrease in cash generated from operations in addition the state of the financial markets could impact the company’s ability to obtain future funding as of december 31 2007 the company has not experienced adverse affects from the current financial market turmoil 

the company continues to generate positive cash flows from operating activities and believes that the best use of its excess cash is to repay its longterm debt to grow the business and under certain favorable conditions to repurchase stock additionally the company has in the past and expects in the future to acquire or make investments in complementary companies products services and technologies 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

the company does not have any special purpose entities or offbalance sheet financing 

contractual obligations 

the company’s significant contractual obligations as of december 31 2007 are summarized below 

 

  

      the company expended 26 million 18 million and 800000 related to unconditional purchase obligations that existed as of the beginning of each year for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the company believes that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 

revenue is derived principally from the licensing of computer software products and from related maintenance contracts the company recognizes revenue in accordance with sop 972 “ software revenue recognition ” sop 989 “ modification of sop 972 software revenue recognition ” and related interpretations revenue from perpetual licenses is classified as license revenue and is recognized upon delivery of the licensed product and the utility that enables the customer to access authorization keys provided that acceptance has occurred and a signed contractual obligation has been received the price is fixed and determinable and collectibility of the receivable is probable revenue is recorded net of the distributor fee for sales through the ansys distribution network revenue for software lease licenses is classified as license revenue and is recognized over the period of the lease contract the company estimates the value of postcontract customer support “pcs” sold together with perpetual licenses based on separate sales of pcs revenue from pcs contracts is classified as maintenance and service revenue and is recognized ratably over the term of the contract revenue from training support and other services is recognized as the services are performed 

the company warrants to its customers that its software will substantially perform as specified in the company’s most current user manuals the company has not experienced significant claims related to software warranties beyond the scope of maintenance support which the company is already obligated to provide and consequently the company has not established reserves for warranty obligations 

the company’s agreements with its customers generally require it to indemnify the customer against claims that the company’s software infringes third party patent copyright trademark or other proprietary rights such indemnification obligations are generally limited in a variety of industrystandard respects including the company’s right to replace an infringing product as of december 31 2007 the company had not experienced any losses related to these indemnification obligations and no claims with respect thereto were outstanding the company does not expect significant claims related to these indemnification obligations and consequently the company has not established any related reserves 

the company makes judgments as to its ability to collect outstanding receivables and provides allowances for a portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices from both value and delinquency perspectives for those invoices not specifically reviewed provisions are provided at differing rates based upon the age of the receivable and the geographical area of origin in determining these percentages the company analyzes its historical collection experience and current economic trends in the customer’s industry and geographic region if the historical data used to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and future results of operations could be materially affected 

the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 

the company records net deferred tax assets to the extent it believes these assets will more likely than not be realized in making such determination the company considers all available positive and negative evidence including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and recent financial operations in the event the company determines that it would be able to realize deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be recorded which would reduce the provision for income taxes 

  

in july 2006 the fasb issued financial interpretation no 48 “ accounting for uncertainty in income taxes ” “fin 48” which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with sfas no 109 “ accounting for income taxes ” fin 48 provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits income tax positions must meet a morelikelythannot recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized upon the adoption of fin 48 and in subsequent periods this interpretation also provides guidance on measurement derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition fin 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 

the company adopted the provisions of fin 48  on january 1 2007 as a result of this adoption the company recognized approximately a 30 million increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits which was accounted for as a reduction to the january 1 2007 balance of retained earnings of 16 million and an increase to the january 1 2007 balance of goodwill of 14 million 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141r “business combinations ” “sfas 141r” sfas 141r establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree the statement also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statement to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination sfas 141r is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 accordingly any business combinations we engage in will be recorded and disclosed following existing gaap until january 1 2009 the company expects sfas no 141r will have an impact on its consolidated financial statements when effective but the nature and magnitude of the specific effects will depend upon the nature terms and size of the acquisitions consummated after the effective date 18 million of the 79 million liability for unrecognized tax benefits as of december 31 2007 relate to tax positions of acquired entities taken prior to their acquisition by the company if such liabilities are settled for lesser amounts prior to the adoption of sfas 141r the reversal of any remaining liability will affect goodwill if such liabilities reverse subsequent to the adoption of sfas 141r such reversals will affect the income tax provision in the period of reversal the company is still assessing the full impact of this standard on its future consolidated financial statements 

the company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the income tax expense line in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheet 

the company tests goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment at least annually by comparing the fair value of each asset or in the case of goodwill the company’s single reporting unit to its carrying value fair value is estimated using the discounted cash flow and other valuation methodologies in preparing the estimate of fair value the company relies on a number of factors including historical operating results business plans anticipated future cash flows economic projections and other market data because there are inherent uncertainties involved in these factors the company’s estimates of fair value are imprecise and the resulting carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets may be misstated 

the company is involved in various investigations claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of its business activities the company reviews the status of these matters assesses its financial exposure and records a related accrual if the potential loss from an investigation claim or legal proceeding is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable significant judgment is involved in the determination of probability and in the determination of whether an exposure is reasonably estimable as a result of the uncertainties involved in making these estimates the company may have to revise its estimates as facts and circumstances change the revision of these estimates could have a material impact on the company’s financial position and results of operations 

the company grants options to purchase its common stock to employees and directors under the company’s stock option plan eligible employees can also purchase shares of the company’s common stock at a discount under the company’s employee stock purchase plan the benefits provided under these plans are sharebased payments subject to the provisions of statement no 123r effective january 1 2006 the company uses the fair value method to apply the provisions of statement no 123r with a modified prospective application which provides for certain changes to the method for valuing sharebased compensation prior to this adoption the company had elected to account for stockbased compensation arrangements through the intrinsic value method under the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 25 “accounting for stockbased compensation” under the intrinsic value method compensation expense is measured as the excess if any of the market value of the underlying common stock over the amount the employee is required to pay on the date both the number of shares and the price to be paid are known for the years ended december 31 2005 no compensation expense had been recognized in the consolidated statements of income as option grants generally were made with exercise prices equal to the fair value of the underlying common stock on the award date which was typically the date of compensation measurement 

  

the valuation provisions of statement no 123r apply to new awards and to awards that are outstanding on the effective date and subsequently modified or cancelled under the modified prospective application prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes sharebased compensation expense recognized under statement no 123r for 2007 and 2006 was 89 million and 56 million respectively as of december 31 2007 total unrecognized estimated compensation expense related to nonvested stock options granted prior to that date was 304 million which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 22 years net stock options after forfeitures and cancellations granted during 2007 2006 and 2005 represented 109 247 and 150 respectively of outstanding shares as of the beginning of each fiscal year net stock options after forfeitures and cancellations granted during 2007 2006 and 2005 represented 107 205 and 147 respectively of outstanding shares as of the end of each fiscal year 

based on the requirements in statement no 123r the value of each sharebased award was estimated on the date of grant using the blackscholes optionpricing model “blackscholes model” which is the same model that was used for the pro forma information required to be disclosed under statement no 123 the determination of the fair value of sharebased payment awards on the date of grant using an optionpricing model is affected by the company’s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables these variables include the company’s expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors riskfree interest rates and expected dividends the table below presents the assumptions used in calculating the compensation expense recorded within the company’s consolidated statement of income in compliance with statement no 123r as of december 31 2007 and 2006 and those used in presenting the pro forma information included within the footnotes of the company’s annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2005 the interest rates used were determined by using the fiveyear treasury note yield on the date of grant 

 

 the company issues both nonqualified and incentive stock options however incentive stock options comprise a significant portion of outstanding stock options the tax benefits associated with incentive stock options are unpredictable as they are predicated upon an award recipient triggering an event that disqualifies the award and that then results in a tax deduction to the company statement no 123r requires that these tax benefits be recorded at the time of the triggering event the triggering events for each option holder are not easily projected in order to estimate the tax benefits related to incentive stock options the company makes many assumptions and estimates including the number of incentive stock options that will be exercised during the period by us employees the number of incentive stock options that will be disqualified during the period and the fair market value of the company’s stock price on the exercise dates each of these items is subject to significant uncertainty additionally a significant portion of the tax benefits related to disqualified incentive stock options is accounted for as an increase to equity additional paidin capital rather than as a reduction in income tax expense especially in the periods most closely following the adoption date of statement no 123r although all such benefits continue to be realized through the company’s tax filings this accounting treatment has the effect of increasing tax expense and reducing net income for example the company realized a tax benefit of 45 million during the year ended december 31 2007 related to disqualified incentive stock options however only 243000 of such amount was recorded as a reduction in income tax expense although there are significant limitations in estimating the impact of statement no 123r including those discussed above the company currently estimates that the impact of statement no 123r will be a decrease in 2008 operating income of approximately 12 million – 14 million and a decrease in 2008 net income of approximately 10 million – 11 million or approximately 012 – 014 per diluted share 

if factors change and the company employs different assumptions in the application of statement no 123r in future periods the compensation expense that the company will record under statement no 123r may differ significantly from what the company has recorded in the current period therefore it is important for investors to be aware of the high degree of subjectivity involved when using option pricing models to estimate sharebased compensation under statement no 123r optionpricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions are fully transferable and do not cause dilution because the company’s sharebased payments have characteristics significantly different from those of freely traded options and because changes in the input assumptions can materially affect the company’s estimates of fair values in the company’s opinion existing valuation models including the blackscholes models may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of the company’s sharebased compensation consequently there is a risk that the company’s estimates of the fair values of the company’s sharebased compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise expiration early termination or forfeiture of those sharebased payments in the future certain sharebased payments such as employee stock options 

  

may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in the company’s financial statements alternatively value may be realized from these instruments that is significantly in excess of the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in the company’s financial statements there is currently no marketbased mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models nor is there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values although the fair value of employee sharebased awards is determined in accordance with statement no 123r and the securities and exchange commission’s staff accounting bulletin no 107 “sab 107” using an optionpricing model that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyerseller market transaction 

estimates of sharebased compensation expenses are significant to the company’s financial statements but these expenses are based on the aforementioned option valuation model and will never result in the payment of cash by the company for this reason and because the company does not view sharebased compensation as related to its operational performance the board of directors and management exclude estimated sharebased compensation expense when evaluating the company’s underlying business performance 

recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements 

the company adopted statement no 123r as of january 1 2006 the statement requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grantdate fair value of the award the cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award typically the vesting period for additional information refer to disclosures regarding the adoption of this statement within critical accounting policies above and in notes 2 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k

the company has an agreement with le centre technique des industries mecaniques “cetim” of senlis france under which cetim licenses ansys workbench and simulation technologies and packages them as an integral part of its current designspace pe products and future releases 

competition 

the company believes that the principal factors affecting sales of its software include ease of use breadth and depth of functionality flexibility quality ease of integration with other software systems file compatibility across computer platforms range of supported computer platforms performance price and cost of ownership customer service and support company reputation and financial viability and effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts 

the company continues to experience intense competition across all markets for its products and services some of the company’s current and possible future competitors have greater financial technical marketing and other resources than the company and some have well established relationships with current and potential customers of the company these competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes price reductions andor increased operating costs and could result in lower revenues margins and net income 

  

proprietary rights and licenses 

the company regards its software as proprietary and relies on a combination of trade secret copyright patent and trademark laws license agreements nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect its proprietary rights in its products the company distributes its software under software license agreements that grant customers nonexclusive licenses for the use of the company’s products which are typically nontransferable license agreements for the company’s products are directly between the company and end users use of the licensed software is restricted to designated computers at specified sites unless the customer obtains a multisite license for its use of the software software security measures are also employed to prevent unauthorized use of the company’s software and the licensed software is subject to terms and conditions prohibiting unauthorized reproduction of the software customers may either purchase a perpetual license of the technology with the right to annually purchase ongoing maintenance technical support and updates or may lease the product on an annual basis for a fee that includes the license maintenance technical support and upgrades 

the company licenses its software utilizing a combination of webbased and hardcopy license terms and forms for certain software products the company primarily relies on “clickwrapped” licenses the enforceability of these types of agreements under the laws of some jurisdictions is uncertain 

the company also seeks to protect the source code of its software as a trade secret and as unpublished copyrighted work the company has obtained federal trademark registration protection for ansys cfx fluent designspace autodyn and other marks in the us and in foreign countries additionally the company was awarded a patent by the us patent and trademark office for its webbased reporting technology 

employees of the company have signed covenant agreements under which they have agreed not to disclose trade secrets or confidential information and where legally permitted that restrict engagement in or connection with any business that is competitive with the company anywhere in the world while employed by the company and in some cases for specified periods thereafter and that any products or technology created by them during their term of employment are the property of the company in addition the company requires all channel partners and resellers to enter into agreements not to disclose the company’s trade secrets and other proprietary information 

despite these precautions there can be no assurance that misappropriation of the company’s technology and proprietary information will not occur further there can be no assurance that copyright trademark patent and trade secret protection will be available for the company’s products in certain countries or that restrictions on the ability of employees and channel partners to engage in activities competitive with the company will be enforceable 

the software development industry is characterized by rapid technological change therefore the company believes that factors such as the technological and creative skills of its personnel new product developments frequent product enhancements name recognition and reliable product maintenance are more important to establishing and maintaining technology leadership than the various legal protections of its technology that may be available 

the company does not believe that any of its products infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties there can be no assurance however that third parties will not claim such infringement by the company or its licensors or licensees with respect to current or future products the company expects that software suppliers will increasingly be subject to the risk of such claims as the number of products and suppliers continues to expand and the functionality of products continues to increase any such claims with or without merit could be timeconsuming result in costly litigation cause product shipment delays or require the company to enter into royalty or licensing agreements such royalty or licensing agreements if required may not be available on terms acceptable to the company 

seasonal variations 

the company’s business has experienced significant seasonality including quarterly reductions in software sales resulting from the global slowdown during the summer months particularly in europe as well as from the seasonal purchasing and budgeting patterns of the company’s global customers 

backlog 

the company generally ships its products within 30 days after acceptance of an order and execution of a software license agreement accordingly the company does not believe that its backlog at any particular point in time is indicative of future sales levels 

  

employees 

as of december 31 2006 the company and its subsidiaries had approximately 1400 fulltime employees at that date there were also contract personnel and coop students providing ongoing development services and technical support the company believes that its relationship with its employees is good

 item 1a risk factors tableend the company cautions investors that its performance and therefore any forwardlooking statement is subject to risks and uncertainties various important factors including but not limited to the following may cause the company’s future results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statement 

potential fluctuations in operating results the company may experience significant fluctuations in future quarterly operating results fluctuations may be caused by many factors including but not limited to the timing of new product releases or product enhancements by the company or its competitors the size and timing of individual orders including a fluctuation in the demand for and the ability to complete large contracts software errors or other product quality problems competition and pricing changes customer order deferrals in anticipation of new products or product enhancements changes in demand for the company’s products changes in operating expenses changes in the mix of software license and maintenance and service revenue personnel changes and general economic conditions a substantial portion of the company’s operating expenses is related to personnel facilities and marketing programs the level of personnel and related expenses cannot be adjusted quickly and is based in significant part on the company’s expectation for future revenue the company does not typically experience significant order backlog further the company has often recognized a substantial portion of its revenue in the last month of a quarter with this revenue frequently concentrated in the last weeks or days of a quarter during certain quarterly periods the company has been dependent upon receiving large orders of perpetual licenses involving the payment of a single upfront fee and more recently has shifted the business emphasis of its products to provide a collaborative solution to the company’s customers this emphasis has increased the company’s average order size and the related sales cycle time for the larger orders this shift may have the effect of increasing the volatility of the company’s revenue and profit from period to period as a result product revenue in any quarter is substantially dependent upon sales completed in the latter part of that quarter and revenue for any future quarter is not predictable with any significant degree of accuracy 

seasonal variations the company’s business has experienced significant seasonality including quarterly reductions in software sales resulting from the slowdown during the summer months throughout the world particularly in europe as well as from the seasonal purchasing and budgeting patterns of the company’s global customers 

economic slowdown in certain sectors the company’s sales are based significantly on end user demand for products in key industrial sectors many of these sectors periodically experience economic declines these economic declines may be exacerbated by other economic factors such as the recent increase in global energy prices these economic factors may adversely affect the company’s business by extending sales cycles and reducing revenue 

the company has customers that supply a wide spectrum of goods and services in virtually all of the world’s major economic regions the company’s performance is materially impacted by general economic conditions and the performance of its customers the company’s management team forecasts macroeconomic trends and developments and integrates them through longrange planning into budgets research and development strategies and a wide variety of general management duties when forecasting future economic trends and technological developments management does not have a comparative advantage to the extent that the company’s forecasts are in error by being overly optimistic or overly pessimistic about the performance of an economy or sector the company’s performance may be hindered because of a failure to properly match corporate strategy with economic conditions 

terrorist attacks other increased global hostilities and natural disasters have at times contributed to widespread uncertainty and speculation in the world financial markets this uncertainty and speculation may result in economic contraction and a related suspension or delay of purchasing by the company’s customers 

stock market and stock price volatility market prices for securities of software companies have generally been volatile in particular the market price of the company’s common stock has been and may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations as a result of factors affecting the company the software industry or the securities markets in general such factors include but are not limited to declines in trading price that may be triggered by the company’s failure to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors the company cannot provide assurance that in such circumstances the trading price of the company’s common stock will recover or that it will not experience a further decline moreover the trading price could be subject to additional fluctuations in response to quartertoquarter variations in the company’s operating results material announcements made by the company or its competitors conditions in the software industry generally or other events and factors many of which are beyond the company’s control 

  

rapidly changing technology new products risk of product defects the company operates in an industry generally characterized by rapidly changing technology and frequent new product introductions that can render existing products obsolete or unmarketable a major factor in the company’s future success will be its ability to anticipate technological changes and to develop and introduce in a timely manner enhancements to its existing products and new products to meet those changes if the company is unable to introduce new products and to respond quickly to industry changes its business financial position results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

the introduction and marketing of new or enhanced products require the company to manage the transition from existing products in order to minimize disruption in customer purchasing patterns there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing and marketing on a timely basis new products or product enhancements that its new products will adequately address the changing needs of the marketplace or that it will successfully manage the transition from existing products software products as complex as those offered by the company may contain undetected errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are released and the likelihood of errors is increased as a result of the company’s commitment to accelerating the frequency of its product releases there can be no assurance that errors will not be found in new or enhanced products after commencement of commercial shipments any of these problems may result in the loss of or delay in customer acceptance diversion of development resources damage to the company’s reputation or increased service and warranty costs any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

sales of new products the company continues to develop and introduce new software products certain of these products require a higher level of sales and support expertise the ability of the company’s sales channel particularly the indirect channel to obtain this expertise and to sell the new product offerings effectively could have an impact on the company’s sales in future periods additionally royalties and engineering service engagements associated with the new software products may result in the company’s cost of sales increasing as a percentage of revenue in future periods 

dependence on channel partners the company continues to distribute a meaningful portion of its products through its global network of independent regional channel partners the channel partners sell the company’s software products to new and existing customers expand installations within the existing customer base offer consulting services and provide the first line of technical support consequently in certain geographies the company is highly dependent upon the efforts of the channel partners difficulties in ongoing relationships with channel partners such as delays in collecting accounts receivable failure to meet performance criteria or to promote the company’s products as aggressively as the company expects and differences in the handling of customer relationships could adversely affect the company’s performance additionally the loss of any major channel partner for any reason including a channel partner’s decision to sell competing products rather than the company’s products could have a material adverse effect on the company moreover the company’s future success will depend substantially on the ability and willingness of its channel partners to continue to dedicate the resources necessary to promote the company’s portfolio of products and to support a larger installed base of the company’s products if the channel partners are unable or unwilling to do so the company may be unable to sustain revenue growth 

currently the company is partially protected from exchange rate fluctuations among the us dollar and other currencies as a result of its indirect sales channel which generally pays the company in us dollars the revenues and expenses associated with the company’s international direct sales channel are subject to foreign currency exchange fluctuations and as a result the company’s future financial results may be impacted by fluctuations in exchange rates additionally any future changes to the company’s sales channel involving proportionally higher direct sales from international locations could result in additional exposure to the foreign currency exchange fluctuations this exposure could adversely impact the company’s financial position and results of operations in future periods 

competition the company continues to experience intense competition across all markets for its products and services some of the company’s current and possible future competitors have greater financial technical marketing and other resources than the company and some have well established relationships with current and potential customers of the company these competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes price reductions andor increased operating costs and could result in lower revenues margins and net income 

dependence on senior management and key technical personnel the company is highly dependent upon the ability and experience of its senior executives and its key technical and other management employees the loss of these employees could adversely affect the company’s ability to conduct its operations 

  

risks associated with international activities a majority of the company’s business comes from outside the united states risks inherent in the company’s international business activities include imposition of government controls export license requirements restrictions on the export of critical technology products and services political and economic instability trade restrictions changes in tariffs and taxes difficulties in staffing and managing international operations longer accounts receivable payment cycles and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations effective patent copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every foreign country in which the company sells its products and services the company’s business financial position results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks 

as the company continues to expand its direct sales presence in international regions the portion of its revenue expenses cash accounts receivable and payment obligations denominated in foreign currencies continues to increase as a result changes in currency exchange rates from time to time may affect the company’s financial position results of operations and cash flows 

additionally countries in certain international regions have continued to experience weaknesses in their currency banking and equity markets these weaknesses could adversely affect consumer demand for the company’s products and ultimately the company’s financial position results of operations and cash flows 

as the company has grown it has become increasingly subject to the risks arising from adverse changes in domestic and global economic conditions an economic slowdown globally or regionally could cause many companies to delay or reduce technology purchases which could impact the company’s visibility into the closing of new business as opposed to its recurring business a slowdown could also contribute to reductions in sales longer sales cycles and increased price pressure each of these items could adversely affect the company’s sales in future periods 

the company has historically received significant tax benefits related to its export activities in october 2004 the american jobs creation act of 2004 was signed into law and included replacement legislation for existing export benefits this bill retains certain export benefits for transactions in the ordinary course of business under binding contracts with unrelated persons in effect on september 17 2003 the phaseout of the existing export benefits associated with the legislation is summarized as follows 

 

 in addition to repealing the export tax benefits the american jobs creation act of 2004 provides significant tax relief for domestic manufacturers effective for taxable years beginning after december 31 2004 qualifying entities may deduct a certain percentage as defined below of the lesser of their qualified production activities income or their taxable income for a taxable year the deduction however is limited to 50 of an employer’s w2 wages for the tax year beginning in 2010 when the 9 deduction is fully phased in corporations facing a marginal tax rate of 35 will be subject to an effective tax rate of 3185 on qualifying income 

 

 in 2006 and 2005 export benefits reduced the company’s effective tax rate by 45 and 29 respectively the adverse impact of the above legislation on the company’s effective tax rate in 2006 was 17 and was not significant in 2005 the company expects the impact of the above legislation on the 2007 effective tax rate to be similar to that of 2006 any other prospective changes regarding tax benefits associated with the company’s export sales or other federal and state tax planning vehicles may adversely impact the company’s effective tax rate and decrease its net income in future periods 

  

dependence on proprietary technology the company’s success is highly dependent upon its proprietary technology the company generally relies on contracts and the laws of copyright and trade secrets to protect its technology the company maintains a trade secrets program enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees and distributors and limits access to and distribution of its software documentation and other proprietary information there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company to protect its proprietary technology will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of its technology by third parties or that third parties will not be able to develop similar technology independently although the company is not aware that any of its technology infringes upon the rights of third parties there can be no assurance that other parties will not assert technology infringement claims against the company or that if asserted such claims will not prevail 

reliance on perpetual licenses although the company has historically maintained stable recurring revenue from the sale of software lease licenses software maintenance subscriptions and third party royalties it also has relied on sales of perpetual licenses that involve payment of a single upfront fee and that are more typical in the computer software industry while revenue generated from software lease licenses software maintenance subscriptions and third party royalties currently represents a portion of the company’s revenue to the extent that perpetual license revenue continues to represent a significant percentage of total revenue the company’s revenue in any period will depend increasingly on sales completed during that period 

risks associated with significant sales to existing customers a significant portion of the company’s sales includes followon sales to existing customers that invest in the company’s broad suite of engineering simulation software and services if a significant number of current customers were to become dissatisfied with the company’s products and services or choose to license or utilize competitive offerings the company’s followon sales and recurring lease and maintenance revenues could be materially adversely impacted resulting in lower revenue operating margins net income and cash flows 

risks associated with acquisitions the company has consummated and may continue to consummate certain acquisitions including the 2006 acquisition of fluent in order to support the company’s longterm strategic direction expand its customer base provide greater scale to increase its investments in research and development to accelerate innovation provide increased capabilities to its existing products supply new products and services or enhance its distribution channels in the future the company may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or if suitable candidates are identified the company may not be able to complete the business combination on commercially acceptable terms business acquisitions may result in devotion of significant management and financial resources 

in addition for companies acquired limited experience will exist for several quarters following the acquisition relating to how the acquired company’s sales pipelines will convert into sales or revenues and the conversion rate postacquisition may be quite different from the historical conversion rate because a substantial portion of the company’s software license revenue is completed in the latter part of a quarter and its cost structure is largely fixed in the short term revenue shortfalls may have a negative impact on the company’s profitability a delay in a small number of large new software license transactions could cause the company’s quarterly new software license revenues to fall significantly short of its predictions 

acquisitions present many risks and the company may not realize the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of any transaction an acquisition program is an important element of the company’s corporate strategy the difficulties of integrating companies and acquired assets include among others 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the company expects to continue to acquire companies products services and technologies risks that may be encountered in acquisitions include 

 

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 these factors could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial position results of operations or cash flows particularly in the case of a larger acquisition or number of acquisitions 

disruption of operations or infrastructure failures a significant portion of the company’s software development personnel source code and computer equipment is located at operating facilities in the united states canada india and throughout europe the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unforeseen catastrophe such as infection of the avian influenza with key personnel at any of these facilities could cause interruptions in the company’s operations services and product development activities additionally if the company experiences problems that impair its business infrastructure such as a computer virus telephone system failure or an intentional disruption of its information technology systems by a third party these interruptions could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial position results of operations cash flows and the ability to meet financial reporting timelines further because the company’s sales are not generally linear during any quarterly period the potential adverse effects resulting from any of the events described above or any other disruption of the company’s business could be accentuated if it occurs close to the end of a fiscal quarter 

indebtedness incurred in connection with the acquisition of fluent inc in partial consideration for the company’s acquisition of fluent the company incurred longterm debt from committed bank financing of approximately 198 million as of december 31 2006 borrowings outstanding totaled 1219 million this indebtedness is material in relation to prior levels of indebtedness as the company did not have any prior outstanding debt the incurrence of indebtedness among other things could 

 

  

  

 if the company incurs new indebtedness in the future the related risks that it now faces could intensify whether the company is able to make required payments on its outstanding indebtedness and to satisfy any other future debt obligations will depend on its future operating performance and its ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing 

periodic reorganization of sales force the company relies heavily on its direct sales force from time to time the company reorganizes and makes adjustments to its sales force in response to such factors as management changes performance issues market opportunities and other considerations these changes may result in a temporary lack of sales production and may adversely impact revenue in future quarters there can be no assurance that the company will not restructure its sales force in future periods or that the transition issues associated with such a restructuring will not recur 

  

third party royalty agreements the company has agreements with third parties whereby it receives royalty revenues in return for the right of the third party to utilize the company’s technology or embed the company’s technology in the third party’s products to the extent that the company is unable to maintain these third party relationships or that the third party is unsuccessful in selling the embedded products there could be a material adverse impact on the company’s business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

sales forecasts the company makes many operational and strategic decisions based upon short and longterm sales forecasts the company’s sales personnel continually monitor the status of all proposals including the estimated closing date and the value of the sale in order to forecast quarterly sales these forecasts are subject to significant estimation and are impacted by many external factors for example a slowdown in information technology spending or economic factors could cause purchasing decisions to be delayed a variation in actual sales activity from that forecasted could cause the company to plan or to budget incorrectly and therefore could adversely affect the company’s business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

income tax estimates the company makes significant estimates in determining its worldwide income tax provision these estimates involve complex tax regulations in a number of jurisdictions across the company’s global operations and are subject to many transactions and calculations in which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain although the company believes that its estimates are reasonable the final outcome of tax matters could be different than the estimates reflected in the historical income tax provision and related accruals such differences could have a material impact on income tax expense and net income in the period in which such determination is made 

regulatory compliance like all other public companies the company is subject to the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission “sec” including those that require the company to report on and receive a certification from its independent accounting firm regarding the company’s internal controls compliance with these requirements causes the company to incur additional expenses and causes management to divert time from the daytoday operations of the company while the company anticipates being able to fully comply with these internal control requirements if it is not able to comply with the sarbanesoxley reporting or certification requirements relating to internal controls the company may be subject to sanction by the sec or nasdaq 

the company’s stock is listed on the nasdaq global select market thus the company is subject to the ongoing financial and corporate governance requirements of nasdaq while the company anticipates being able to fully comply with these requirements if it is not able to comply the company’s name may be published on nasdaq’s daily noncompliant companies list until nasdaq determines that it has regained compliance or the company no longer trades on nasdaq 

the company’s sales to the united states government must comply with the regulations set forth in the federal acquisition regulations failure to comply with these regulations could result in penalties being assessed against the company or an order preventing the company from making future sales to the united states government further the company’s international activities must comply with the export control laws of the united states the foreign corrupt practices act and a variety of other laws and regulations of the united states and other countries in which the company operates failure to comply with any of these laws and regulations could adversely affect the company’s business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

contingencies the company is involved in various investigations claims and legal proceedings from time to time that arise in the ordinary course of its business activities these proceedings currently include customary audit activities by various government authorities each of these matters is subject to various uncertainties and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to the company 

changes in existing financial accounting standards or taxation rules changes in existing accounting or taxation rules or practices new accounting pronouncements or taxation rules or varying interpretations of current accounting pronouncements or taxation practices could have a significant adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or the manner in which the company conducts its business further such changes could potentially affect the company’s reporting of transactions completed before such changes are effective for example the company was not previously required to record stockbased compensation charges to earnings in connection with stock option grants to its employees however the fasb issued statement no 123r that requires the company to record stockbased compensation charges to earnings as of january 1 2006 such charges negatively impacted the company’s earnings 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to certain market risks primarily foreign currency exchange rates that arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business the company seeks to minimize these risks primarily through its normal operating and financing activities

interest expense rate risk  the company entered into two credit agreements with variable interest rates as of may 1 2006 for a total of 198 million the amounts borrowed with respect to one of the credit agreements were paid in full as of december 31 2006 borrowings outstanding as of december 31 2006 totaled 1219 million for the year ended december 31 2006 the company recorded interest expense related to the term loans of 71 million representing a weighted average interest rate of 631 in addition the company recorded amortization related to debt financing costs of 500000 based on the effective interest rates and outstanding borrowings at december 31 2006 a 50 basis point increase in interest rates on the company’s borrowings would not impact the company’s interest expense for the quarter ending march 31 2007 and would increase the company’s interest expense by approximately 300000 for the year ending december 31 2007 

 

 the interest rate is based on the company’s consolidated leverage ratio and generally ranges from libor  050  125 or at the company’s election prime rate  000  025 the interest rate is set for the quarter ending march 31 2007 at 612 on 619 million of the total outstanding balance which was based on threemonth libor  075 for the remaining outstanding balance of 600 million the company secured a fixed interest rate of 606 through september 28 2007 which is based on oneyear libor  075 

foreign currency transaction risk as the company continues to expand its business presence in international regions the portion of its revenue expenses cash accounts receivable and payment obligations denominated in foreign currencies continues to increase as a result changes in currency exchange rates from time to time may affect the company’s financial position results of operations and cash flows the company is most impacted by movements in the british pound the euro the canadian dollar the japanese yen the indian rupee the swedish krona and the chinese renminbi on average for the year ended december 31 2006 the us dollar was 10 weaker when measured against the company’s primary foreign currencies than for the year ended december 31 2005 the us dollar weakened against the british pound the euro the canadian dollar the swedish krona and the chinese renminbi while it strengthened against the indian rupee and the japanese yen these fluctuations resulted in a 600000 increase in revenue and a 100000 decrease in operating income during 2006 as compared with 2005 

the largest fluctuations and the most significant impact on revenue and operating income were primarily attributable to the euro and the british pound throughout 2006 the us dollar weakened against these currencies whereas during 2005 the us dollar strengthened this is exhibited by the average monthend exchange rates provided in the chart below 

 

 as of december 31 2006 fluent a domestic subsidiary had euro british pound and japanese yen denominated intercompany loansadvances with its foreign subsidiaries in order to provide a natural hedge ansys the us parent company purchased 9 million euros 500000 british pounds and 800 million japanese yen and held these currencies in cash as of december 31 2006 this natural hedge substantially mitigates the foreign currency exchange risk on the intercompany loansadvances if ansys sells some or all of the foreign currency held without a corresponding change in the intercompany balances the natural hedge will be eliminated and the company will be exposed to additional foreign currency exchange risk 

based on the nature of the company’s business it has no direct exposure to commodity price risk

the company has an agreement with le centre technique des industries mecaniques “cetim” of senlis france under which cetim licenses ansys workbench and simulation technologies and packages them as an integral part of their current designspace pe products and future releases 

  

competition 

the company believes that the principal factors affecting sales of its software include ease of use breadth and depth of functionality flexibility quality ease of integration with other software systems file compatibility across computer platforms range of supported computer platforms performance price and cost of ownership customer service and support company reputation and financial viability and effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts although the company believes that it currently performs effectively with respect to these factors there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to perform effectively with respect to all or any of these factors there also can be no assurance that other software suppliers and customers will not develop their own software or acquire software from suppliers other than the company or otherwise discontinue their relationships with the company if any of these events occur the company’s business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

the company continues to experience intense competition across all markets for its products and services some of the company’s current and possible future competitors have greater financial technical marketing and other resources than the company and some have well established relationships with current and potential customers of the company these competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes price reductions andor increased operating costs and could result in lower revenues margins and net income 

proprietary rights and licenses 

the company regards its software as proprietary and relies on a combination of trade secret copyright and trademark laws license agreements nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect its proprietary rights in its products the company distributes its software under software license agreements that grant customers nonexclusive licenses for the use of the company’s products which are typically nontransferable license agreements for the company’s products are directly between the company and end users use of the licensed software is restricted to designated computers at specified sites unless the customer obtains a multisite license for its use of the software software security measures are also employed to prevent unauthorized use of the company’s software and the licensed software is subject to terms and conditions prohibiting unauthorized reproduction of the software customers may either purchase a perpetual license of the technology with the right to annually purchase ongoing maintenance technical support and updates or may lease the product on an annual basis for a fee which includes the license maintenance technical support and upgrades 

for certain software products the company primarily relies on “clickwrapped” licenses the enforceability of these types of agreements under the laws of some jurisdictions is uncertain 

the company also seeks to protect the source code of its software as a trade secret and as unpublished copyrighted work the company has obtained federal trademark registration protection for ansys cfx designspace and autodyn in the us and in foreign countries additionally the company was awarded a patent by the us patent and trademark office for its webbased reporting technology and has a patent pending for its simulation wizard technology 

employees of the company have signed covenant agreements under which they have agreed not to disclose trade secrets or confidential information and where legally permitted which restrict engagement in or connection with any business which is competitive with the company anywhere in the world while employed by the company and in some cases for specified periods thereafter and that any products or technology created by them during their term of employment are the property of the company in addition the company requires all channel partners and resellers to enter into agreements not to disclose the company’s trade secrets and other proprietary information 

despite these precautions there can be no assurance that misappropriation of the company’s technology will not occur further there can be no assurance that copyright trademark patent and trade secret protection will be available for the company’s products in certain countries or that restrictions on the ability of employees and channel partners to engage in activities competitive with the company will be enforceable 

the software development industry is characterized by rapid technological change therefore the company believes that factors such as the technological and creative skills of its personnel new product developments frequent product enhancements name recognition and reliable product maintenance are more important to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position than the various legal protections of its technology which may be available 

  

the company does not believe that any of its products infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties there can be no assurance however that third parties will not claim in the future such infringement by the company or its licensors or licensees with respect to current or future products the company expects that software product developers will increasingly be subject to such claims as the number of products and competitors continue to expand and the functionality of products continues to increase any such claims with or without merit could be timeconsuming result in costly litigation cause product shipment delays or require the company to enter into royalty or licensing agreements such royalty or licensing agreements if required may not be available on terms acceptable to the company 

seasonal variations 

the company’s business has experienced significant seasonality including quarterly reductions in software sales resulting from the slowdown in europe during the summer months as well as from the seasonal purchasing and budgeting patterns of the company’s customers 

backlog 

the company generally ships its products within 30 days after acceptance of an order and execution of a software license agreement accordingly the company does not believe that its backlog at any particular point in time is indicative of future sales levels 

employees 

as of december 31 2005 the company and its subsidiaries had approximately 600 fulltime employees at that date there were also contract personnel and coop students providing ongoing development services and technical support the company believes that its relationship with its employees is good 

available information 

the company’s website is wwwansyscom  the company makes available on its website annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k reports filed pursuant to section 16 and amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after such materials are electronically filed or furnished to the securities and exchange commission in addition the company has posted the charters for its audit committee compensation committee and nominating and corporate governance committee as well as the company’s code of business conduct and ethics and standard business practices information posted on the company’s website is not incorporated by reference in this annual report on form 10k 

  




 item 1a risk factors 

the company cautions investors that its performance and therefore any forwardlooking statement is subject to risks and uncertainties various important factors including but not limited to the following may cause the company’s future results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statement 

potential fluctuations in operating results the company may experience significant fluctuations in future quarterly operating results fluctuations may be caused by many factors including the timing of new product releases or product enhancements by the company or its competitors the size and timing of individual orders including a fluctuation in the demand for and the ability to complete large contracts software errors or other product quality problems competition and pricing changes customer order deferrals in anticipation of new products or product enhancements changes in demand for the company’s products changes in operating expenses changes in the mix of software license and maintenance and service revenue personnel changes and general economic conditions a substantial portion of the company’s operating expenses is related to personnel facilities and marketing programs the level of personnel and related expenses cannot be adjusted quickly and is based in significant part on the company’s expectation for future revenue the company does not typically experience significant order backlog further the company has often recognized a substantial portion of its revenue in the last month of a quarter with this revenue frequently concentrated in the last weeks or days of a quarter during certain quarterly periods the company has been dependent upon receiving large orders of perpetual licenses involving the payment of a single upfront fee and more recently has shifted the business emphasis of its products to provide a collaborative solution to the company’s customers this emphasis has increased the company’s average order size and increased the related sales cycle time for the larger orders this shift may have the effect of increasing the volatility of the company’s revenue and profit from period to period as a result product revenue in any quarter is substantially dependent upon sales completed in the latter part of that quarter and revenue for any future quarter is not predictable with any significant degree of accuracy 

seasonal variations the company’s business has experienced significant seasonality including quarterly reductions in software sales resulting from the slowdown in europe during the summer months as well as from the seasonal purchasing and budgeting patterns of the company’s customers 

economic slowdown in certain sectors the company’s sales are based significantly on end user demand for products in key industrial sectors many of these sectors periodically experience economic declines these economic declines may be exacerbated by other economic factors such as the recent increase in global energy prices these economic factors may adversely affect the company’s business by extending sales cycles and reducing revenue 

the company has customers who supply a wide spectrum of goods and services in virtually all of the world’s major economic regions the company’s performance is materially impacted by general economic conditions and the performance of its customers the company’s management team forecasts macroeconomic trends and developments and integrates them through longrange planning into budgets research and development strategies and a wide variety of general management duties when forecasting future economic trends and technological developments management does not have a comparative advantage to the extent that the company’s forecasts are in error by being overly optimistic or overly pessimistic about the performance of an economy or sector the company’s performance may be hindered because of a failure to properly match corporate strategy with economic conditions 

terrorist attacks other increased global hostilities and natural disasters have at times contributed to widespread uncertainty and speculation in the world financial markets this uncertainty and speculation may result in further economic contraction resulting in the suspension or delay of purchasing by the company’s customers 

stock market and stock price volatility market prices for securities of software companies have generally been volatile in particular the market price of the company’s common stock has been and may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations as a result of factors affecting the company the software industry or the securities markets in general such factors include but are not limited to declines in trading price that may be triggered by the company’s failure to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors the company cannot provide assurance that in such circumstances the trading price of the company’s common stock will recover or that it will not experience a further decline moreover the trading price could be subject to additional fluctuations in response to quartertoquarter variations in the company’s operating results material announcements made by the company or its competitors conditions in the software industry generally or other events and factors many of which are beyond the company’s control 

  

rapidly changing technology new products risk of product defects the company operates in an industry generally characterized by rapidly changing technology and frequent new product introductions that can render existing products obsolete or unmarketable a major factor in the company’s future success will be its ability to anticipate technological changes and to develop and introduce in a timely manner enhancements to its existing products and new products to meet those changes if the company is unable to introduce new products and to respond quickly to industry changes its business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

the introduction and marketing of new or enhanced products require the company to manage the transition from existing products in order to minimize disruption in customer purchasing patterns there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing and marketing on a timely basis new products or product enhancements that its new products will adequately address the changing needs of the marketplace or that it will successfully manage the transition from existing products software products as complex as those offered by the company may contain undetected errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are released and the likelihood of errors is increased as a result of the company’s commitment to accelerating the frequency of its product releases there can be no assurance that errors will not be found in new or enhanced products after commencement of commercial shipments any of these problems may result in the loss of or delay in customer acceptance diversion of development resources damage to the company’s reputation or increased service and warranty costs any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

sales of new products the company continues to develop and introduce new software products certain of these products require a higher level of sales and support expertise the ability of the company’s sales channel particularly the indirect channel to obtain this expertise and to sell the new product offerings effectively could have an impact on the company’s sales in future periods additionally royalties and engineering service engagements associated with the new software products may result in the company’s cost of sales increasing as a percentage of revenue in future periods 

dependence on channel partners the company continues to distribute a substantial portion of its products through its global network of independent regional channel partners the channel partners sell the company’s software products to new and existing customers expand installations within the existing customer base offer consulting services and provide the first line of technical support consequently the company is highly dependent upon the efforts of the channel partners difficulties in ongoing relationships with channel partners such as delays in collecting accounts receivable failure to meet performance criteria or to promote the company’s products as aggressively as the company expects and differences in the handling of customer relationships could adversely affect the company’s performance additionally the loss of any major channel partner for any reason including a channel partner’s decision to sell competing products rather than the company’s products could have a material adverse effect on the company moreover the company’s future success will depend substantially on the ability and willingness of its channel partners to continue to dedicate the resources necessary to promote the company’s products and to support a larger installed base of the company’s products if the channel partners are unable or unwilling to do so the company may be unable to sustain revenue growth 

currently the company is partially protected from exchange rate fluctuations among the us dollar and other currencies as a result of its indirect sales channel which generally pays the company in us dollars the revenues and expenses associated with the company’s international direct sales channel are subject to foreign currency exchange fluctuations and as a result the company’s future financial results may be impacted by fluctuations in exchange rates additionally any future changes to the company’s sales channel involving proportionally higher direct sales from international locations could result in additional exposure to the foreign currency exchange fluctuations this exposure could adversely impact the company’s financial position and results of operations in future periods 

competition the company continues to experience intense competition across all markets for its products and services some of the company’s current and possible future competitors have greater financial technical marketing and other resources than the company and some have well established relationships with current and potential customers of the company these competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes price reductions andor increased operating costs and could result in lower revenues margins and net income 

  

dependence on senior management and key technical personnel the company is highly dependent upon the ability and experience of its senior executives and its key technical and other management employees although the company has employment agreements with certain employees the loss of these employees or any of the company’s other key employees could adversely affect the company’s ability to conduct its operations 

risks associated with international activities a majority of the company’s business comes from outside the united states of america risks inherent in the company’s international business activities include imposition of government controls export license requirements restrictions on the export of critical technology products and services political and economic instability trade restrictions changes in tariffs and taxes difficulties in staffing and managing international operations longer accounts receivable payment cycles and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations effective patent copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every foreign country in which the company sells its products and services the company’s business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks 

as the company continues to expand its direct sales presence in international regions the portion of its revenue expenses cash accounts receivable and payment obligations denominated in foreign currencies continues to increase as a result changes in currency exchange rates from time to time may affect the company’s financial position results of operations and cash flows 

additionally countries in certain international regions have continued to experience weaknesses in their currency banking and equity markets these weaknesses could adversely affect consumer demand for the company’s products and ultimately the company’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

as the company has grown it has become increasingly subject to the risks arising from adverse changes in domestic and global economic conditions as a result of the current economic slowdown many companies are delaying or reducing technology purchases which has had an impact on the company’s visibility into the closing of new business as opposed to its recurring business this slowdown has also contributed to and may continue to contribute to reductions in sales longer sales cycles and increased price pressure each of these items could adversely affect the company’s sales in future periods 

the company has historically received significant tax benefits related to its export activities in october 2004 the american jobs creation act of 2004 was signed into law and included replacement legislation for existing export benefits this bill retains certain export benefits for transactions in the ordinary course of business under binding contracts with unrelated persons in effect on september 17 2003 the phaseout of the existing export benefits associated with the legislation is summarized as follows 

export benefit phaseout 

 

 in addition to repealing the export tax benefits the american jobs creation act of 2004 provides significant tax relief for domestic manufacturers effective for taxable years beginning after december 31 2004 qualifying entities may deduct a certain percentage as defined below of the lesser of their qualified production activities income or their taxable income for a taxable year the deduction however is limited to 50 of an employer’s w2 wages for the tax year beginning in 2010 when the 9 deduction is fully phased in corporations facing a marginal tax rate of 35 would be subject to an effective tax rate of 3185 on qualifying income 

manufacturing income deduction phasein 

 

   

in 2005 export benefits reduced the company’s effective tax rate by approximately 29 the impact of the above legislation on the company’s effective tax rate in 2005 was not significant the company expects the above legislation to adversely impact the effective tax rate by 10 in 2006 any other prospective changes regarding tax benefits associated with the company’s export sales or other federal and state tax planning vehicles may adversely impact the company’s effective tax rate and decrease its net income in future periods 

dependence on proprietary technology the company’s success is highly dependent upon its proprietary technology although the company was awarded a patent by the us patent and trademark office for its webbased reporting technology the company generally relies on contracts and the laws of copyright and trade secrets to protect its technology although the company maintains a trade secrets program enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees and distributors and limits access to and distribution of its software documentation and other proprietary information there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company to protect its proprietary technology will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of its technology by third parties or that third parties will not be able to develop similar technology independently although the company is not aware that any of its technology infringes upon the rights of third parties there can be no assurance that other parties will not assert technology infringement claims against the company or that if asserted such claims will not prevail 

increased reliance on perpetual licenses although the company has historically maintained stable recurring revenue from the sale of software lease licenses software maintenance subscriptions and third party royalties it also has relied on sales of perpetual licenses that involve payment of a single upfront fee and that are more typical in the computer software industry while revenue generated from software lease licenses software maintenance subscriptions and third party royalties currently represents a portion of the company’s software license revenue to the extent that perpetual license revenue continues to represent a significant percentage of total software license revenue the company’s revenue in any period will depend increasingly on sales completed during that period 

risks associated with acquisitions the company has consummated and may continue to consummate certain strategic acquisitions in order to provide increased capabilities to its existing products supply new products and services or enhance its distribution channels in the future the company may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or if suitable candidates are identified the company may not be able to complete the business combination on commercially acceptable terms business acquisitions may result in devotion of significant management and financial resources the ability of the company to integrate the acquired businesses including delivering sales and support ensuring continued customer commitment obtaining further commitments and challenges associated with expanding sales in particular markets and retaining key personnel will impact the success of these acquisitions if the company is unable to properly and timely integrate the acquired businesses there could be a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

disruption of operations or infrastructure failures a significant portion of the company’s software development personnel source code and computer equipment is located at operating facilities in the united states canada and europe the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unforeseen catastrophe at any of these facilities could cause interruptions in the company’s operations services and product development activities additionally if the company experiences problems that impair its business infrastructure such as a computer virus telephone system failure or an intentional disruption of its information technology systems by a third party these interruptions could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition results of operations cash flows and the ability to meet financial reporting timelines further because the company’s sales are not generally linear during any quarterly period the potential adverse effects resulting from any of the events described above or any other disruption of the company’s business could be accentuated if it occurs close to the end of a fiscal quarter 

periodic reorganization of sales force the company relies heavily on its direct sales force from time to time the company reorganizes and makes adjustments to its sales force in response to such factors as management changes performance issues market opportunities and other considerations these changes may result in a temporary lack of sales production and may adversely impact revenue in future quarters there can be no assurance that the company will not restructure its sales force in future periods or that the transition issues associated with such a restructuring will not recur 

third party royalty agreements the company has agreements with third parties whereby it receives royalty revenues in return for the right of the third party to utilize the company’s technology or embed the company’s technology in the third party’s products to the extent that the company is unable to maintain these third party relationships or that the third party is unsuccessful in selling the embedded products there could be a material adverse impact on the company’s business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

sales forecasts the company makes many operational and strategic decisions based upon short and longterm sales forecasts the company’s sales personnel continually monitor the status of all proposals including the estimated closing date and the value of the sale in order to forecast quarterly sales these forecasts are subject to significant estimation and are impacted by many external factors for example a slowdown in information technology spending or economic factors could cause purchasing decisions to be delayed a variation in actual sales activity from that forecasted could cause the company to plan or to budget incorrectly and therefore could adversely affect the company’s business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

income tax estimates the company makes significant estimates in determining its worldwide income tax provision these estimates involve complex tax regulations in a number of jurisdictions across the company’s global operations and are subject to many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain although the company believes that its estimates are reasonable the final outcome of tax matters could be different than the estimates reflected in the historical income tax provision and related accruals such differences could have a material impact on income tax expense and net income in the period in which such determination is made 

regulatory compliance like all other public companies the company is subject to the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission “sec” including those that require the company to report on and receive a certification from its independent accounting firm regarding the company’s internal controls compliance with these requirements causes the company to incur additional expenses and causes management to divert time from the daytoday operations of the company while the company anticipates being able to fully comply with these internal control requirements if it is not able to comply with the sarbanesoxley reporting or certification requirements relating to internal controls the company may be subject to sanction by the sec or nasdaq 

the company’s stock is listed on the nasdaq national market thus the company is subject to the ongoing financial and corporate governance requirements of nasdaq while the company anticipates being able to fully comply with these requirements if it is not able to comply the company’s name may be published on nasdaq’s daily noncompliant companies list until nasdaq determines that it has regained compliance or the company no longer trades on nasdaq 

the company’s sales to the government of the united states must comply with the regulations set forth in the federal acquisition regulations failure to comply with these regulations could result in penalties being assessed against the company or an order preventing the company from making future sales to the united states government further the company’s international activities must comply with the export control laws of the united states the foreign corrupt practices act and a variety of other laws and regulations of the united states of america and other countries in which the company operates failure to comply with any of these laws and regulations could adversely affect the company’s business financial position results of operation and cash flows 

contingencies the company is involved in various investigations claims and legal proceedings from time to time that arise in the ordinary course of its business activities these proceedings currently include customary audit activities by various taxing authorities each of these matters is subject to various uncertainties and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to the company 

changes in existing financial accounting standards or taxation rules changes in existing accounting or taxation rules or practices new accounting pronouncements or taxation rules or varying interpretations of current accounting pronouncements or taxation practice could have a significant adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or the manner in which the company conducts its business further such changes could potentially affect the company’s reporting of transactions completed before such changes are effective for example the company is not currently required to record stockbased compensation charges to earnings in connection with stock option grants to its employees however the fasb issued statement no 123r which will require the company to record stockbased compensation charges to earnings commencing in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 such charges will negatively impact the company’s earnings

the company’s products have an installed base of approximately 80000 seats at commercial sites and approximately 129000 seats at university sites worldwide the company’s products are utilized by organizations ranging in size from small consulting firms to the world’s largest industrial companies no single customer accounted for more than 10 of the company’s revenue in 2002 

information with respect to foreign and domestic revenue may be found in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements and the section entitled “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of the annual report to stockholders for the year ended december 31 2002 “2002 annual report to stockholders” which financial statements are included in exhibit 131 to this annual report on form 10k and incorporated herein by reference 

strategic alliances and marketing relationships 

the company has established and continues to pursue strategic alliances with advanced technology suppliers and marketing relationships with hardware vendors specialized application developers cad and plm providers the company believes these relationships allow accelerated incorporation of advanced technology into the ansys designspace ainastran and icem cfd products provide access to important new markets expand the company’s sales channels develop specialized product applications and provide direct integration with leading cad systems 

the company has technical and marketing relationships with leading cad vendors such as autodesk parametric technology corporation dassault systemes and electronic data systems to provide direct links between products these links facilitate the transfer of electronic data models between the cad systems and ansys products 

the company has established relationships with leading suppliers of computer hardware including hewlettpackard sgi sun microsystems ibm dell intel and various graphics card vendors these relationships typically provide the company with joint marketing opportunities such as advertising events and internet links with the hardware partner’s home page in addition the company receives reduced equipment costs and software porting support to ensure that the company’s software products are certified to run on various hardware platforms 

the company’s enhanced solution partner program actively encourages specialized developers of niche software solutions to use ansys as a development platform for their applications in most cases the sale of the enhanced solution partners’ products is accompanied by the sale of an ansys product 

the company has a software license agreement with livermore software technology corporation “lstc” under which lstc has provided lsdyna software for explicit dynamics solutions used in applications such as crash test simulation in the automotive and other industries under this arrangement lstc assists in the integration of the lsdyna software with the company’s pre and postprocessing capabilities and provides updates and problem resolution in return for a share of revenue from sales of ansyslsdyna

the company has developed icepak a cfd application for thermal management of electronic enclosures in cooperation with fluent inc under this agreement the product is distributed by fluent inc and royalties are paid to the company 

competition 

the cad cae and computeraided manufacturing “cam” markets are intensely competitive in the traditional cae market the company’s primary competitors include mscsoftware corporation and abaqus inc formerly hibbitt karlsson and sorensen inc the company also faces competition from smaller vendors of specialized analysis applications in fields such as computational fluid dynamics in addition certain integrated cad and plm suppliers such as parametric technology corporation electronic data systems corporation and dassault systemes provide varying levels of design analysis optimization and verification capabilities as part of their product offerings the entrance of new competitors would likely intensify competition in all or a portion of the overall cad cae and cam markets some of the company’s current and possible future competitors have greater financial technical marketing and other resources than the company and some have wellestablished relationships with current and potential customers of the company it also is possible that alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share or that competition will increase as a result of software industry consolidation increased competition may result in price reductions reduced profitability and loss of market share any of which would materially adversely affect the company’s business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the company believes that the principal competitive factors affecting its market include ease of use breadth and depth of functionality flexibility quality ease of integration into cad systems file compatibility across computer platforms range of supported computer platforms performance price and cost of ownership customer service and support company reputation and financial viability and effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts although the company believes that it currently competes effectively with respect to such factors there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its competitive position against current and potential competitors there also can be no assurance that cad software companies will not develop their own analysis software acquire analysis software from companies other than the company or otherwise discontinue their relationships with the company if any of these events occur the company’s business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

proprietary rights and licenses 

the company regards its software as proprietary and relies on a combination of trade secret copyright and trademark laws license agreements nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect its proprietary rights in its products the company distributes its software under software license agreements that grant customers nonexclusive licenses for the use of the company’s products which are typically nontransferable although the company distributes its products through the asds and the reseller channel license agreements for the company’s products are directly between the company and end users use of the licensed software is restricted to designated computers at specified sites unless the customer obtains a site license for its use of the software software security measures are also employed to prevent unauthorized use of the company’s software and the licensed software is subject to terms and conditions prohibiting unauthorized reproduction of the software customers may either purchase a paidup perpetual license of the technology with the right to annually purchase ongoing maintenance technical support and updates or may lease the product on an annual basis for a fee which includes the license maintenance technical support and upgrades 

for certain software products the company primarily relies on “clickwrapped” licenses the enforceability of these types of agreements under the laws of certain jurisdictions is uncertain 

the company also seeks to protect the source code of its software as a trade secret and as unpublished copyrighted work the company has obtained federal trademark protection for ansys and designspace the company has also obtained trademark registrations of ansys and designspace in a number of foreign countries and is in the process of seeking such registration in other foreign countries additionally the company was awarded a patent by the us patent and trademark office for its webbased reporting technology 

the employees of the company have signed covenant agreements under which they have agreed not to disclose trade secrets or confidential information or to engage in or become connected with any business which is competitive with the company anywhere in the world while employed by the company and in some cases for specified periods thereafter and that any products or technology created by them during their term of employment are the property of 

the company in addition the company requires all asds and resellers to enter into agreements not to disclose the company’s trade secrets and other proprietary information 

despite these precautions there can be no assurance that misappropriation of the company’s technology will not occur further there can be no assurance that copyright and trade secret protection will be available for the company’s products in certain countries or that restrictions on competition will be enforceable 

the software development industry is characterized by rapid technological change therefore the company believes that factors such as the technological and creative skills of its personnel new product developments frequent product enhancements name recognition and reliable product maintenance are more important to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position than the various legal protections of its technology which may be available 

the company does not believe that any of its products infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties there can be no assurance however that third parties will not claim in the future such infringement by the company or its licensors or licensees with respect to current or future products the company expects that software product developers will increasingly be subject to such claims as the number of products and competitors in the company’s market segment grow and the functionality of products in different market segments overlaps any such claims with or without merit could be timeconsuming result in costly litigation cause product shipment delays or require the company to enter into royalty or licensing agreements such royalty or licensing agreements if required may not be available on terms acceptable to the company 

backlog 

the company generally ships its products within 30 days after acceptance of an order and execution of a software license agreement accordingly the company does not believe that its backlog at any particular point in time is indicative of future sales levels 

employees 

as of december 31 2002 the company had approximately 450 fulltime employees at that date there were also approximately 20 contract personnel and coop students providing ongoing development services and technical support the company believes that its relationship with its employees is good
