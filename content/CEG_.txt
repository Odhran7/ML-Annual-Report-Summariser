our business 

we are america’s leading clean energy company based on the production of carbonfree electricity we are the largest supplier of clean energy and sustainable solutions to homes businesses governments community aggregations and a range of wholesale customers such as municipalities cooperatives and other strategics across the continental us backed by approximately 32400 megawatts of generating capacity consisting of nuclear wind solar natural gas and hydroelectric assets we produced nearly 10 of the nations carbonfree energy based on generation output of electricity based on published reports on energy delivery by the us energy information administration making us an important partner to businesses and state and local governments that are setting ambitious carbonreduction goals and seeking longterm solutions to the climate crisis we operate in 48 states canada and now employ approximately 12700 people after separation 

we are differentiated by owning the cleanest generation fleet in the country we are committed to a clean energy future and we believe our generation fleet is essential to helping meet clean energy targets at both the state and national level we are uniquely positioned through the pairing of our clean energy fleet with our customerfacing business our customerfacing business is one of the nations largest competitive energy suppliers offering innovative options along the sustainability continuum to meet customer clean energy and climate goals 

our operations 

we operate the largest carbonfree generation fleet in the nation and are one of the largest competitive electric generation companies in the country as measured by owned and contracted mw collectively the combined fleet is nearly 90 carbonfree based on generation output of electricity and is the fourth largest generation portfolio in the us in terms of total generation with meaningful geographic diversity 

at december 31 2021 our generating resources consisted of the following

the following table shows sources of electric supply in gwh for 2021 and 2020 



 

a includes the proportionate share of output where we have an undivided ownership interest in jointlyowned generating plants and includes the total output of plans that are fully consolidated 

b includes wind hydroelectric solar and biomass generating assets 

nuclear facilities 

our nuclear fleet is the nation’s largest with current generating capacity of approximately 21 gigawatts it produced 175 terawatt hours of zeroemissions electricity during 2021 – enough to power 149 million homes and avoid more than 124 million metric tons of carbon emissions according to the us epa ghg equivalencies calculator we have ownership interests in 13 nuclear generating stations currently in service consisting of 23 units as of december 31 2021 we wholly own all our nuclear generating stations except for undivided ownership interests in four jointly owned nuclear stations quad cities 75 ownership peach bottom 50 ownership salem 4259 ownership and nine mile point unit 2 82 ownership which are consolidated in our financial statements relative to our proportionate ownership interest in each unit see item 2 properties for additional information on our nuclear facilities 

on august 6 2021 constellation and edf entered into a settlement agreement pursuant to which we through a wholly owned subsidiary purchased edf’s equity interest in ceng a joint venture with edf which wholly owns the calvert cliffs and ginna nuclear stations and nine mile point unit 1 in addition to the 82 undivided ownership interest in nine mile point unit 2 prior to august 6 2021 we had a 5001 membership interest in ceng however ceng is consolidated within our results for all periods presented see note 2 — mergers acquisitions and dispositions and note 21 — variable interest entities of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the acquisition of edfs equity interest in ceng and the ceng consolidation 

we operate all of these nuclear generating stations except for the two units at salem which are operated by pseg nuclear llc an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of pseg and we have consistently operated our nuclear plants at bestinclass levels during 2021 2020 and 2019 our nuclear generating facilities achieved capacity factors a of 945 954 and 957 respectively at ownership percentage more broadly the nuclear capacity factor has been approximately four percentage points better than the industry average annually since 2013 

capacity factors which are significantly affected by the number and duration of refueling and nonrefueling outages can have a significant impact on our results of operations in 2021 we achieved an average refueling outage duration of 22 days for units we operate during 2020 and 2019 we achieved an average refueling outage duration of 22 days and 21 days against an industry average of 34 and 36 days respectively 

we manage our scheduled refueling outages to minimize their duration and to maintain high nuclear generating capacity factors resulting in a stable generation base for our wholesale and retail power marketing activities in 2021 2020 and 2019 electric supply in gwh generated from our nuclear generating facilities was 65 62 and 64 respectively of our total electric supply which also includes natural gas oil and renewable generation and electric supply purchased for resale see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional information on electric supply sources 

during scheduled refueling outages we perform maintenance and equipment upgrades in order to maintain safe reliable operations and to minimize the occurrence of unplanned outages in addition to the maintenance and equipment upgrades performed by us during scheduled refueling outages we have extensive operating and security procedures in place to ensure the safe operation of our nuclear units we also have extensive safety systems in place to protect the plant personnel and surrounding area in the unlikely event of an accident or other incident 

we have original 40year operating licenses from the nrc for each of our nuclear units and have received 20year operating license renewals from the nrc for all our nuclear units except clinton pseg has received 20year operating license renewals for salem units 1 and 2 peach bottom has received a second 20year license renewal from the nrc for a total 80year term for units 2 and 3 

 

a capacity factor is defined as the ratio of the actual output of a plant over a period of time to its output if the plant had operated at full average annual mean capacity for that time period see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional information 

the following table summarizes the current license expiration dates for our nuclear facilities currently in service 



 

a denotes year in which nuclear unit began commercial operations 

b although timing has been delayed we currently plan to seek license renewal for clinton and have received a timely renewal exemption from the nrc that allows for the license renewal application to be filed in the first quarter of 2024 

the operating license renewal process takes approximately four to five years from the commencement of the process which includes approximately two years for us to develop the application and approximately two additional years for the nrc to review the application depreciation provisions are based on the estimated useful lives of the stations which correspond with the term of the nrc operating licenses denoted in the table above as of december 31 2021 from august 27 2020 through september 15 2021 byron and dresden depreciation provisions were accelerated to reflect the previously announced shutdown dates of september 2021 and november 2021 respectively on september 15 2021 we updated the estimated useful lives for both facilities to reflect the end of the current nrc operating license for each unit consistent with the table above see note 3 — regulatory matters and note 7 — early plant retirements of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on byron and dresden and the illinois cmc program 

the tmi nuclear station located in middletown pennsylvania permanently ceased generation operations on september 20 2019 the oyster creek nuclear station located in forked river new jersey which permanently ceased generation operations on september 17 2018 was sold to holtec international holtec on july 1 2019 see note 2 — mergers acquisitions and dispositions and note 7 — early plant retirements of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the disposition of oyster creek and the retirement of tmi 

natural gas oil and renewable facilities including hydroelectric 

we operate approximately 12 gigawatts of natural gas oil hydroelectric wind and solar generation assets which provide a mix of baseload intermediate and peak power generation we wholly own all our natural gas oil and renewable generating stations except for 1 wyman 2 certain wind project entities and 3 crp which is owned 49 by another owner we operate all of these facilities except for wyman which is operated by the principal owner nextera energy resources llc a subsidiary of nextera energy inc see item 2 properties for additional information regarding these generating facilities and note 21 — variable interest entities of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding crp which is a vie 

in 2021 2020 and 2019 electric supply in gwh generated from our owned natural gas oil and renewable generating facilities was 10 9 and 11 respectively of our total electric supply much of this output was dispatched to support our wholesale and retail power marketing activities our natural gas oil and renewable fleet has similarly demonstrated a track record of strong performance with a power dispatch match a of 724 984 and 979 and renewables energy capture b of 957 934 and 963 in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively our power dispatch match performance in 2021 was significantly impacted by the february 2021 extreme weather event in texas refer to note 3 — regulatory matters for additional information 

natural gas oil wind and solar generation plants are generally not licensed and therefore the decision on when to retire plants is fundamentally a commercial one ferc has the exclusive authority to license most nonfederal hydropower projects located on navigable waterways or federal lands or connected to the interstate electric grid which include our conowingo hydroelectric project conowingo and muddy run pumped storage facility project muddy run muddy runs license expires on december 1 2055 and conowingos on february 28 2071 the stations are currently being depreciated over their estimated useful lives which correspond with the available license terms see note 3 — regulatory matters of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on conowingo 

on march 31 2021 and june 30 2021 we completed the sale of a significant portion of our solar business and our interest in the albany green energy biomass facility respectively note 2 — mergers acquisitions and dispositions for additional information on these dispositions 

 

a dispatch match is used to measure the responsiveness of a unit to the market expressed as the actual energy relative to the total desired energy desired energy is measured by revenues less purchased power and fuel costs when unit is dispatched by us or the rto 

b energy capture is an indicator of how efficiently the installed assets capture the natural energy available from the wind and the sun energy capture represents an energybased fraction the numerator of which is the energy produced by the sum of the wind turbinessolar panels in the year and the denominator of which is the total expected energy to be produced during the year energy capture for the combined wind and solar fleet is weighted by the relative site projected pretax variable revenue with deductions made for certain events that are noncontrollable such as force majeure events and transmission curtailments 

contracted generation 

in addition to energy produced by owned generation assets we source electricity from plants we do not own under longterm contracts the following tables summarize our longterm contracts to purchase unitspecific physical power with an original term in excess of one year in duration by region in effect as of december 31 2021 





customerfacing business 

we are one of the nation’s largest energy suppliers through our integrated business operations we sell electricity natural gas and other energy related products and solutions to various types of customers including distribution utilities municipalities cooperatives and commercial industrial governmental and residential customers in competitive markets across multiple geographic regions we serve approximately 2 million total customers including approximately 217000 commercial industrial and public sector customers including threefourths of fortune 100 companies and about 16 million unique residential customers we also have a noncommodity element of our customer facing business providing sustainability efficiency and technology solutions to offer a comprehensive suite of energy solutions to meet customers’ growing and evolving needs 

we are a leader in electric power supply serving 205 twhs in 2021 through sales to retail customers and wholesale load auctions to a diverse geographic customer base the following table illustrates these volumes across our five reportable segments 

2021 electric power supply twhs served across regions a  

 

a includes retail load and wholesale load auction volumes only electric generation in excess of our total retail and wholesale load would be marketed to the respective iso in which our facility is located other includes new england south  west 

we are active in all domestic wholesale power and gas markets that span the entire lower 48 states and have complementary retail activity across many of those states we largely obtain physical power supply from our owned and contracted generation in multiple geographic regions the commodity risks associated with the output from owned and contracted generation are managed using various commodity transactions including sales to customers and our ratable hedging program see further discussion of the ratable hedging program in the price and supply risk management section below the main objective is to obtain lowcost energy supply to meet physical delivery obligations to both our wholesale and retail customers 

wholesale market 

our wholesale channeltomarket involves the sale of electricity among electric utilities and electricity marketers before it is eventually sold to enduse consumers in 2021 we served approximately 65 twhs of power load across competitive utility load procurements and bilateral sales to municipalities coops banks and other wholesale entities complementary to our national portfolio we have several decades of relationships with wholesale counterparties across all domestic power markets as a means of both monetizing our own generation as well as sourcing contracted generation to meet customer and portfolio needs with the increased trend toward customer demand for sustainability this ability to source contracted generation has provided a capitallight way for us to provide customers with the renewable products they are demanding to support a cleaner energy ecosystem this creates durable customer relationships and repeatable business through the ability to respond to customer and marketplace trends similarly this contracting acumen provides the ability to supplement our native generation with other nonrenewable assets to meet changing portfolio needs in a financially efficient manner in our wholesale gas business we participate across all parts of the gas value chain including trading transport and storage and physical supply 

retail market 

retail competition in states across the us range from full competition of generation suppliers for all retail customers commercial industrial and residential to partial retail competition available up to a capped amount for industrial customers only we are a leader in retail markets serving approximately 140 twhs of electric power load and 800 bcf of gas in 2021 primarily to commercial and industrial ci customers across multiple geographic regions in the us 

constellation retail has a diverse geographic footprint 

strong customer relationships are a key part of our customerfacing business strategy as demonstrated by our high retention rates retail customer retention rates have been strong over the last five years across ci power customer groups with average contract terms of approximately 25 months and customer duration of more than six years with many customers well beyond these metrics specifically we enjoyed a 80 ci power customer renewal rate and a 89 ci gas customer retention rate in 2021 consistent with the previous four years owing to both our competitive pricing as well as our strong customer relationships our consistently high renewal rates are driven by our ability to provide customized solutions and deliver focused attention to our customers’ needs resulting in industryleading customer satisfaction we are also successful at acquiring new customers by offering diverse innovative services and products that meet their needs in addition to our high customer renewal rates we have experienced consistent high new win rates for ci power as well acquiring nearly one out of every three new customers who have chosen to shop with us over the past three years 

high customer satisfaction levels market expertise stability and scale drive growth and result in historically proven business consistency and margins while providing customers with the best possible price is a key focus we leverage our broad suite of electric and gas product structures oftentimes customized to provide customers with the commodity solution and information that best fits their needs it is this attention to the customer that creates the durable repeatable value highlighted in these statistics 

consumer purchasing strategies have trended from direct supply relationships to thirdparty relationships with a growing number of customers looking to thirdparty consultants and brokers to find suppliers like us to reduce costs and evaluate the increasing number of options available for expanding energy solutions beyond the commodity in response we have expanded our thirdparty capabilities created scale through a comprehensive support structure and enhanced digital applications providing tools tracking and measurement as well as the ability to extend the reach of our sustainability services and products to drive additional market share while this trend of customers using thirdparties to find suppliers has slowed in recent years we have remained the market leader in direct sales with over 45 of the commercial and industrial market share of direct customer business driven by our highly experienced and long tenor direct sales team 

energy solutions 

as one of the largest customerfacing platforms in the us we benefit from significant economies of scale which allow us to provide our customers with competitively priced energy and to structure highly tailored solutions targeted to a customer’s unique power needs and clean energy goals we partner with our customers to provide options along the sustainability continuum including renewable efficiency and technology applications to meet their carbonfree energy goals our energy efficiency products provide the ability to optimize performance and maximize efficiency across customer facilities and operations through contract structures that include implementation of energy efficiency upgrades with no upfront capital requirements additionally these services provide scalable solutions to meet sustainability goals through investment across the life of the facility or operations and allow for budget certainty the ongoing ability to optimize energy consumption for customers allows us to support customer demands with the right combination of technology and efficiency program options

price and supply risk management 

we use a combination of wholesale and retail customer load sales as well as nonderivative and derivative contracts using both overthecounter and exchangetraded instruments including options swaps and forward and futures contracts all with creditapproved counterparties to hedge the price risk of the generation portfolio for merchant revenues not already hedged via comprehensive state programs such as the cmc in illinois we utilize a threeyear ratable sales plan to align our hedging strategy with our financial objectives the prompt threeyear merchant revenues are hedged on an approximate rolling 906030 basis providing cash flow stability for our investors while still allowing commercial opportunities to generate value for the enterprise we may also enter transactions that are outside of this ratable hedging program we are exposed to commodity price risk in 2022 and beyond for portions of our electricity portfolio that are unhedged as of december 31 2021 the 

percentage of expected generation hedged for the midatlantic midwest new york and ercot reportable segments is 92  95  and 73  76  for 2022 and 2023 respectively similarly the scale and scope of the portfolio provides riskmitigating technology product and geographical diversification we will continue to be proactive in using hedging strategies to mitigate commodity price volatility 

the percentage of expected generation hedged is the number of equivalent sales divided by the expected generation expected generation is the volume of energy that best represents our commodity position in energy markets from owned or contracted generation based on a simulated dispatch model that makes assumptions regarding future market conditions which are calibrated to market quotes for power fuel load following products and options equivalent sales represent all wholesale and retail load sales as well as hedging products which include economic hedges and certain nonderivative contracts a portion of our hedging strategy may be implemented using fuel products based on assumed correlations between power and fuel prices our risk management group monitors the financial risks of the wholesale and retail power marketing activities we also use financial and commodity contracts for proprietary trading purposes but this activity accounts for only a small portion of our efforts the proprietary trading portfolio is subject to a risk management policy that includes stringent risk management limits see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information 

the cycle of production and utilization of nuclear fuel includes the mining and milling of uranium ore into uranium concentrates the conversion of uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride the enrichment of the uranium hexafluoride and the fabrication of fuel assemblies nuclear fuel assemblies are obtained predominantly through longterm uranium concentrate supply contracts contracted conversion services contracted enrichment services or a combination thereof and contracted fuel fabrication services we have inventory in various forms and do not anticipate difficulty in obtaining the necessary uranium concentrates or conversion enrichment or fabrication services to meet the nuclear fuel requirements of our nuclear units we size our inventory holdings and forward contractual requirements to protect against supply disruptions and nearterm price volatility while mitigating concentration of risk with our suppliers and allowing for capital flexibility 

natural gas is procured through longterm and shortterm contracts as well as spotmarket purchases fuel oil inventories are managed so that in the winter months sufficient volumes of fuel are available in the event of extreme weather conditions and during the remaining months to take advantage of favorable market pricing 

see item 1a risk factors item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates and note 16 — derivative financial instruments of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding derivative financial instruments 

seasonality 

our operations are affected by weather which affects demand for electricity and natural gas as well as operating conditions the market price for electricity is also affected by changes in the demand for electricity and the available supply of electricity with respect to the electric business very warm weather in summer months and with respect to the electric and natural gas businesses very cold weather in winter months is referred to as “favorable weather conditions” because those weather conditions result in increased deliveries of electricity and natural gas conversely mild weather reduces demand as a result our operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis especially when more severe weather conditions such as heat waves or extreme winter weather make such fluctuations more pronounced the pattern of this fluctuation may change depending on the type and location of the facilities owned the retail load served and the terms of contracts to purchase or sell electricity see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information 

insurance 

we are subject to liability property damage and other risks associated with major incidents at our generating stations we have reduced our financial exposure to these risks through insurance both property damage and liability and other industry risksharing provisions we also maintain business interruption insurance for our renewable projects but not for our other generating stations unless required by contract or financing agreements we are selfinsured to the extent that any losses may exceed the amount of insurance maintained or are within the policy deductible for our insured losses 

for additional information regarding property insurance see item 2 properties note 17 — debt and credit agreements for additional information on financing agreements and note 19 — commitments and contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements for insurance specific to our nuclear facilities

businesses and coupled with visible payments to our generation plants for the clean energy attributes we may pursue future growth opportunities that provide additional value building on our core businesses or expanding our competitive advantages we are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet to returning value to our shareholders and to investing in clean energy solutions 

as environmental sustainability continues to build momentum for businesses across the country the demand for carbonfree and sustainability products increases we are committed to a carbonfree energy future and we aim to serve as a partner to businesses and the federal state and local governments that are setting ambitious carbonreduction goals and seeking longterm solutions to the climate crisis for two decades our predecessor company was a strong advocate for policies that would address the climate crisis we will continue to be a leading advocate at the federal level and in our states for policies that will reduce ghg emissions and preserve and grow clean energy 

building upon exelon’s longstanding commitment to reducing our ghg emissions we are committed to the following 

1 achieving a generation portfolio mix with 100 of our owned generation carbonfree by 2040 including an interim goal of 95 carbonfree by 2030 subject to policy support and technology advancements 

2 a 100 reduction of our operationsdriven emissions by 2040 including an interim goal to reduce carbon emissions by 65 from 2020 levels by 2030 and reduce methane emissions 30 from 2020 by 2030 and 

3 providing 100 of ci customers with specific information about their ghg impact 

our business strategy is to maximize value for all our stakeholders coupled with esg principles that are integrated with and core to our strategy through a particular emphasis on 

carbonfree energy advocacy we will continue to work with policymakers to find solutions that drive decarbonization and provide value to customers 

carbonfree energy  climate mitigation we will continue to prioritize safety in operating our reliable best in class carbonfree generation assets and growing the supply of clean power fuels and energy carriers including hydrogen that will be essential to fighting the climate crisis we will mitigate the impacts of climate change on our business through adaptation and building resiliency in our supply chain through partnerships with our key suppliers to build a sustainable supply chain that delivers energy and quality products and services and responsibly manages waste we will also partner with our key energy suppliers on their ghg emissions and climate adaptation strategies 

clean customer transformation customers including businesses and cities are transforming to become more sustainable from energy supply to management from products that supply clean power when they need it 24 hours a day to transformative solutions to integrate clean fuels we will continue to innovate and develop new products to meet our customers’ needs 

technology and commercialization we will partner with our customers suppliers universities governments national labs and startups to support technology advancement through development partnerships and commercialization pathways we commit to help enable future technologies and business models needed to drive the clean energy economy to improve the health and welfare of communities through venture investing and rd we will target 25 of these investments to minority and women led businesses and will require investment recipients to disclose how they engage in equitable employment and contracting practices using performance as a factor when considering investments 

equity and community empowerment we are committed to building a future in which all of our customers employees business partners and communities benefit equitably from social environmental and economic progress

we will employ a disciplined approach to acquisitions that grow future cash flow and support strategic initiatives we will also continue to evaluate asset and business divestitures to rationalize the portfolio and optimize cash proceeds 

various market financial regulatory legislative and operational factors could affect our success in pursuing these strategies we continue to assess infrastructure operational policy and legal solutions to these issues see item 1a risk factors for additional information 

outlook 

the us energy sector is experiencing unprecedented changes that we believe will increase the demand for reliable clean power generation and benefit our business we believe our generation fleet including our nuclear assets is wellpositioned to deliver reliable clean power and benefit from growing demand for carbonfree electricity key drivers of increased demand for clean energy include 

• governmental and corporate policies designed to accelerate the decarbonization of the economy 

• policy support for nuclear energy sources that also enable energy security reliability and diversification 

• rapid electrification of the us economy and 

• evolving customer preferences favoring clean energy choice and digitization 

policy support for decarbonization and emerging carbonfree technologies driven by societal concerns about climate change governments corporations and investors are increasingly advocating for the reduction of ghg emissions across all sectors of the economy with reduction of ghg emissions by the energy sector being a key focus governments at the international national and state levels have established or are currently contemplating increasingly stringent policies that require the reduction of ghg emissions over time corporations have also adopted targets to reduce the carbon emissions in their business operations spurred in part by demand from investors and customers for sustainable environmentfriendly business practices emerging technologies like storage and hydrogen are also helping to advance decarbonization we are committed to a clean energy future and we believe our business is wellpositioned to benefit from growing policy support for 

decarbonization as our generation fleet is essential to helping meet clean energy targets at both the state and federal levels 

policy support for nuclear energy as decarbonization accelerates we expect our generation fleet will play a critical role in meeting baseload power needs nuclear energy is currently the largest source of zero emissions electricity in the us accounting for over 50 of the nation’s carbonfree power and our nuclear plants are meaningful contributors to the clean energy mix in the states in which they operate given the biden administration’s aggressive goals for reducing emissions within the electric power sector policymakers have recognized the urgent need to prevent the retirement of nuclear power plants prior to the end of their licensed lives several states where our nuclear facilities operate have established policies to support nuclear generation driven by factors that include recognition by governments and policy makers that existing nuclear generation facilities are essential to meeting policy objectives on reduction of ghg emissions the desire to support jobs and regional economies and the need to ensure reliability and security of the electrical grid through resource diversity a 2018 study by the massachusetts institute of technology “the future of nuclear energy in a carbonconstrained world” found that the costs of achieving transformational decarbonization targets would increase significantly without the contribution of nuclear power as such we plan to file applications to extend the licenses of our nuclear fleet to 80 years for our units that receive continued policy support for their longterm operation 

electrification of the us economy the push to significantly reduce or eliminate ghg emissions could lead to acceleration of the electrification of the us economy including electrification of transportation industrial operations heating and cooling and appliances which could materially increase demand for electricity we expect widespread electrification could result in us electricity demand to nearly double from what it is today by 2050 although ev sales in north america are well behind europe and china increased policy support from the biden administration together with an increasing number of ev offerings hitting the market over the next five years will drive market share gains in the us market with over 90 of states offering incentives for setting up ev charging infrastructure us ev market sales are projected to rise to 69 million units by 2025 electrification of industrial processes commercial equipment and residential appliances that currently utilize gas and oil as a fuel source will also play a role in increasing the net demand for electricity according to the international energy agency heat makes up twothirds of industrial energy demand and almost onefifth of global energy consumption prompting efforts by energy companies and industrial manufacturers to electrify their thermal processes for companies like us whose core competency is safely generating and serving electricity and related products to its customers the increasing demand from electrification provides natural growth opportunities 

evolving customer preferences consumers are increasingly purposedriven and knowledgeable of services that drive decarbonization leading them to value the ability to be connected to and trace the source of their clean energy choices a thirdparty study found that 60 of consumers have become more aware of climate change since the start of the covid19 pandemic with more than half of consumers likely to invest and upgrade to energy efficiency programs growing awareness of climate change and green energy helps drive customer interest in valueadd services and products around their energy usage such as residential rooftop solar ev charging smart energyefficient home technologies and the ability to choose 100 percent clean power 24 hours a day 365 days a year in competitive retail energy markets continuing innovation in the digitization of the broader economy will facilitate greater control and opportunities for customers and businesses to more frequently engage with their energy providers and become more knowledgeable of their energy choices including the products we provide

environmental matters and regulation 

we are subject to comprehensive and complex environmental legislation and regulation at the federal state and local levels including requirements relating to climate change air and water quality solid and hazardous waste and impacts on species and habitats 

our board of directors is responsible for overseeing the management of environmental matters we have a management team to address environmental compliance and strategy including the ceo and other senior management performance of those individuals directly involved in environmental compliance and strategy is reviewed and affects compensation as part of the annual individual performance review process our board of 

directors has delegated to its nuclear oversight committee and the corporate governance committee the authority to oversee our compliance with health environmental and safety laws and regulations and its strategies and efforts to protect and improve the quality of the environment including our internal climate change and sustainability policies and programs as discussed in further detail below 

climate change 

driven by societal concerns about climate change governments corporations and investors are increasingly advocating for the reduction of ghg emissions across all sectors of the economy with reduction of ghg emissions by the energy sector being a key focus governments at the international national and state levels have established or are currently contemplating increasingly stringent policies that require the reduction of ghg emissions over time corporations have also adopted targets to reduce the carbon emissions in their business operations spurred in part by demand from investors and customers for sustainable environmentfriendly business practices emerging technologies like storage and hydrogen are also helping to advance decarbonization 

we believe our business is wellpositioned to benefit from growing policy support for decarbonization however as detailed below we also face climate change mitigation and transition risks as well as adaptation risks mitigation and transition risks include changes to the energy systems as a result of new technologies changing customer expectations andor voluntary ghg reduction goals as well as local state or federal regulatory requirements intended to reduce ghg emissions adaptation risk refers to risks to our facilities or operations that may result from changes in the physical climate such as changes to temperatures weather patterns and sea level rise see item 1a risk factors for additional information 

climate change mitigation and transition 

we support comprehensive federal climate legislation that addresses the climate crisis and would ensure the country meets the targets set by the paris climate accord in the absence of comprehensive federal legislation we support epa moving forward with meaningful regulation of ghg emissions under the clean air act we currently are subject to and may become subject to additional federal andor state legislation andor regulations addressing ghg emissions 

we are deliberately positioned as a lowcarbon generation company we have minimized ghg emitting assets in our portfolio and maximized carbonfree electric production such that our generation emissions intensity is already 80 less than 2005 levels in support of achieving economywide ghg emissions reduction goals our scope 1 and 2 ghg emissions in 2020 were 82 million metric tons carbon dioxide equivalent of which 78 million metric tons were from our natural gas and oil fueled generation fleet significantly less than our peers with similar volume of power generation 

we produce electricity predominantly from low and carbonfree generating facilities such as nuclear hydroelectric natural gas wind and solar pv and neither own nor operate any coalfueled generating assets our natural gas and oil generating plants produce ghg emissions most notably co2 in addition we sell natural gas at retail and consumers’ use of such natural gas produces ghg emissions however our ownedasset emission intensity or rate of carbon dioxide equivalent co2e emitted per unit of electricity generated is among the lowest in the industry in 2021 we achieved a 945 percent capacity factor across our nuclear fleet and our ownership of 21 gigawatts of carbonfree generation capacity at 23 nuclear units produced 175 twhs of electricity in 2021 — approximately 10 of us carbonfree electric supply 

the electric sector plays a key role in lowering ghg emissions across the rest of the economy electriﬁcation of other sectors such as transportation and buildings coupled with simultaneous decarbonization of electric generation is a key lever for emissions reductions to support this transition we are advocating for public policy supportive of vehicle electrification investing in enabling infrastructure and technology and supporting customer education and adoption we also continue to explore other decarbonization opportunities supporting pilots of emerging energy technologies and development of clean fuels 

international climate change agreements at the international level the united states is a party to the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc the parties to the unfccc adopted the paris agreement at the 21st session of the unfccc conference of the parties cop 21 on december 12 2015 under the agreement which became effective on november 4 2016 the parties committed to try to limit the 

global average temperature increase and to develop national ghg reduction commitments on november 4 2020 the united states formally withdrew from the paris agreement retracting its commitment to reduce domestic ghg emissions by 2628 by 2025 compared with 2005 levels however on january 20 2021 president biden accepted the paris agreement which resulted in the united states’ formal reentry on february 19 2021 the united states has now set an economywide target of reducing its net ghg emissions by 5052 below 2005 levels by 2030 the 2021 unfccc conference of the parties cop26 and resulting glasgow climate pact indicated important global support for the paris agreement and continued progress toward decarbonization 

federal climate change legislation and regulation combating climate change is one of the top legislative agenda items of the biden administration with the president proposing a 100 clean energy economy with net zero ghg emissions by 2050 and to reduce us emissions by 50 or more from 2005 levels by 2030 while consideration of the build back better act has stalled in congress senator joe manchin continues to express an openness to a smaller bill that includes climaterelated provisions that include a production tax credit for clean power sources we support federal tax credits that recognize the value of existing carbonfree nuclear plants and support the development of hydrogen solutions it is uncertain when or whether congress will consider action on a climate bill but the biden administration and members of congress have recognized the importance of existing nuclear power plants which provide half of the nation’s emissionsfree energy to meeting us climate goals a federal tax credit would prevent the continued premature closure of nuclear plants for economic reasons 

regulation of ghgs from power plants under the clean air act the epa’s 2015 clean power plan cpp established regulations addressing carbon dioxide emissions from existing fossilfired power plants under clean air act section 111d the cpp’s carbon pollution limits could be met through changes to the electric generation system including shifting generation from higheremitting units to lower or zeroemitting units as well as the development of new or expanded zeroemissions generation in july 2019 the epa published its final affordable clean energy rule which repealed the cpp and replaced it with less stringent emissions guidelines for existing fossilfired power plants based on heat rate improvement measures that could be achieved within the fence line of individual plants we as part of exelon together with a coalition of other electric utilities filed a lawsuit in the us court of appeals for the dc circuit on september 6 2019 challenging the affordable clean energy rule as unlawful this lawsuit was consolidated with separate challenges to the affordable clean energy rule filed by various states nongovernmental organizations and business coalitions on january 19 2021 the us court of appeals for the dc circuit held the affordable clean energy rule to be unlawful vacated the rule and remanded it to the epa on october 29 2021 the supreme court granted certiorari to examine the extent of epa’s authority to regulate ghgs from power plants a decision is expected in 2022 the epa has indicated it will promulgate new ghg limits for existing power plants 

state climate change legislation and regulation many states in which we operate have state and regional programs to reduce ghg emissions and renewable and other portfolio standards which impact the power sector and other sectors as well 25 states and the district of columbia have 100 clean energy targets deep ghg reductions or both encompassing 54 of us residential electricity customers see discussion below for additional information on renewable and other portfolio standards as the nation’s largest generator of carbonfree electricity our fleet supports these efforts to produce safe reliable electricity with minimal ghgs 

eleven northeast and midatlantic states connecticut delaware maine maryland massachusetts new hampshire new jersey new york rhode island vermont and virginia currently participate in the rggi which is in the process of strengthening its requirements the program requires most fossil fuelfired power plants in the region to hold allowances purchased at auction for each ton of co2 emissions nonemitting resources do not have to purchase or hold these allowances in october 2019 the governor of pennsylvania issued an executive order directing the pa dep to begin a rulemaking process to allow pennsylvania to join the rggi with the goal of reducing carbon emissions from the electricity sector the environmental quality board of the pa dep approved that rule on july 13 2021 paving the way for pennsylvania’s participation in rggi beginning sometime in 2022 

in 2019 new york enacted the climate leadership and community protection act which commits the state to achieving net zero emissions by 2050 with interim emission reduction and renewable energy requirements in 2030 and 2040 new jersey’s energy master plan released in 2020 provides a comprehensive roadmap for achieving the state’s goal of a 100 clean energy economy by 2050 and its global warming response act’s stated ghg emissions reductions of 80 below 2006 levels by 2050 on september 15 2021 illinois public act 1020662 was signed into law by the governor of illinois the clean energy law is designed to achieve 100 

carbonfree power by 2045 to enable the state’s transition to a clean energy economy the clean energy law establishes decarbonization requirements for illinois as well as programs to support the retention and development of emissionsfree sources of electricity 

our nuclear plants are meaningful contributors to the clean energy mix in the states in which they operate states may not be able to meet their zerocarbon goals without our nuclear plants as our plants provide a significant portion of the current carbonfree power several states in which our nuclear facilities operate have established policies to support nuclear generation the supportive policies are driven by several factors including recognition by governments and policy makers that existing nuclear generation facilities are essential to meeting policy objectives on reduction of ghg emissions the desire to support jobs and regional economies and the need to ensure reliability and security of the electrical grid through resource diversity these statespecific policies date of enactment include the following 

• new york clean energy standard 2016 – established a zec program that preserves the environmental attributes of our fitzpatrick ginna and nmp nuclear facilities through 2029 

• illinois zero emission standard 2016  established a zec program that preserves the environmental attributes of our clinton and quad cities nuclear facilities through 2027 

• new jersey clean energy legislation 2018 – established a zec program that includes preserving the environmental attributes of the salem nuclear facility currently through 2025 

• illinois clean energy law 2021 – established a cmc program that preserves the environmental attributes of our byron braidwood and dresden nuclear facilities through 2027 

see note 3 — regulatory matters of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the new jersey clean energy legislation and the illinois clean energy law 

renewable and clean energy standards thirty states and the district of columbia incorporating most of the states where we operate have adopted some form of renewable or clean energy procurement requirement these standards impose varying levels of mandates for procurement of renewable or clean electricity the definition of which varies by state andor energy efficiency these are generally expressed as a percentage of annual electric load often increasing by year load serving entities comply with these various requirements through purchasing qualifying renewables acquiring sufficient credits eg recs paying an alternative compliance payment andor a combination of these compliance alternatives 

while we cannot predict the nature of future regulations or how such regulations might impact future financial statements we have a low emission portfolio and ghg restrictions would likely benefit our zero and lowemission generating units relative to other higheremission fossil fuelfired generating units 

corporate clean energy targets corporations are facing increasing pressure from their customers and investors to align their businesses with international and national environmental and sustainability objectives including supporting goals to reduce ghg emissions in their business operations leading institutional investors and money managers are increasingly considering sustainability as a key factor in investment decisions and are increasingly advocating for more transparency in disclosure on climaterelated matters and pledging to align proxy voting to climaterated proposals with its fiduciary duty an increasing number of corporations are also proactively making commitments to reducing their ghg emissions footprint either through procuring increasing amounts of clean energy or recs to offset their carbon footprint over time as the nation’s largest producer of carbonfree energy we support taking bold action to address the climate change crisis and reestablish leadership in both emerging technologies and existing clean infrastructure that together will power the future 

emerging carbonfree technologies emerging carbonfree technologies like storage and hydrogen are also expected to help accelerate the economy’s decarbonization lower costs statedirected mandates a backlog of storage projects in the interconnection queue and utilities seeking largescale storage capacity to support higher renewables penetration have created conditions for rapid growth of this technology in the us clean hydrogen also has the potential to drive decarbonization particularly as it relates to more challenging sectors like longhaul transportation steel chemicals heating agriculture and longterm power storage nuclear power can be used to produce clean hydrogen and our nuclear fleet positions us well to explore this emerging space both energy storage and clean hydrogen continue to gain political and business support and are expected to help support netzero carbon goals 

climate change adaptation 

our facilities and operations are subject to the global impacts of climate change longterm shifts in climactic patterns such as sustained higher temperatures and sea level rise may present challenges for our facilities and services we believe our operations could be significantly affected by the physical risks of climate change see item 1a risk factors for additional information 

we conduct seasonal readiness reviews at our power plants to ensure availability of fuel supplies and equipment performance before entering the summer and winter seasons and we consider and review national climate assessments to inform our longerterm planning our nuclear fleet is resilient to weather extremes and generates emissions free electricity 24 hours a day even during unexpectedly cold winter events and hot summer events 

other environmental regulation 

air quality 

mercury and air toxics standards mats in 2011 the epa signed a final rule known as mats to reduce emissions of hazardous air pollutants from power plants mats requires coalfired power plants to achieve high removal rates of mercury acid gases and other metals and to make capital investments in pollution control equipment and incur higher operating expenses in 2016 in response to a supreme court decision requiring the epa to consider costs in determining whether it was appropriate and necessary to regulate power plant emissions of hazardous air pollutants the epa issued a supplemental finding that after considering costs it remained appropriate and necessary on may 22 2020 the epa reversed course publishing a final rule revoking the appropriate and necessary finding underpinning mats a coal mining company filed a lawsuit in the us court of appeals for the dc circuit seeking vacatur of mats based on the epa’s may 22 2020 finding on september 11 2020 the us court of appeals for the dc circuit granted a motion by exelon and two other entities to intervene in that lawsuit to defend mats and on september 28 2020 the us court of appeals for the dc circuit issued an executive order holding this portion of the mats litigation in abeyance on july 21 2020 exelon and two other entities filed a lawsuit in the us court of appeals for the dc circuit challenging the epa’s may 22 2020 rescission of the appropriate and necessary finding underpinning mats this portion of the case is also being held in abeyance in response to the doj’s motion filed february 12 2021 on january 20 2021 president biden issued an executive order directing the epa to reconsider its may 22 2020 rescission on january 31 2022 epa signed a proposal to reaffirm that it is appropriate and necessary to regulate hazardous air pollutant emissions from coal and oilfired power plants under section 112 of the clean air act as a result this litigation is likely to be rendered moot and mats will likely remain in place in the interim 

water quality 

under the federal clean water act npdes permits for discharges into waterways are required to be obtained from the epa or from the state environmental agency to which the permit program has been delegated and permits must be renewed periodically certain of our facilities discharge water into waterways and are therefore subject to these regulations and operate under npdes permits 

clean water act section 316b is implemented through the ndpes program and requires that the cooling water intake structures at electric power plants reflect the best technology available to minimize adverse environmental impacts our power generation facilities with cooling water intake systems are subject to the epa’s section 316b regulations finalized in 2014 the regulation’s requirements have been or will be addressed through renewal of these facilities’ npdes permits until the compliance requirements are determined by the applicable state permitting director on a sitespecific basis for each plant we cannot estimate the effect that compliance with the epa’s 2014 rule will have on the operation of our generating facilities and our financial statements should a state permitting director determine that a facility must install cooling towers to comply with the rule that facility’s economic viability could be called into question however the final rule does not mandate cooling towers and allows state permitting directors to require alternative less costly technologies andor operational measures based on a sitespecific assessment of the feasibility costs and benefits of available options 

on july 28 2016 the njdep issued a final permit for salem that did not require the installation of cooling towers and allows salem to continue to operate utilizing the existing cooling water system with certain required system modifications however the permit is being challenged by an environmental organization and if successful could 

result in additional costs for clean water act compliance potential cooling water system modification costs could be material and could adversely impact the economic competitiveness of this facility 

under clean water act section 404 and state laws and regulations we may be required to obtain permits for projects involving dredge or fill activities in waters of the united states 

where our facilities are required to secure a federal license or permit for activities that may result in a discharge to covered waters we may be required to obtain a state water quality certification for those facilities under clean water act section 401 

we are also subject to the jurisdiction of the delaware river basin commission and the susquehanna river basin commission regional agencies that primarily regulate water usage 

solid and hazardous waste and environmental remediation 

cercla provides for response and removal actions coordinated by the epa in the event of threatened releases of hazardous substances and authorizes the epa either to clean up sites at which hazardous substances have created actual or potential environmental hazards or to order persons responsible for the situation to do so under cercla generators and transporters of hazardous substances as well as past and present owners and operators of hazardous waste sites are strictly jointly and severally liable for the cleanup costs of hazardous waste at sites many of which are listed by the epa on the national priorities list npl these prps can be ordered to perform a cleanup can be sued for costs associated with an epadirected cleanup may voluntarily settle with the epa concerning their liability for cleanup costs or may voluntarily begin a site investigation and site remediation under state oversight most states have also enacted statutes that contain provisions substantially like cercla such statutes apply in many states where we currently own or operate or previously owned or operated facilities including delaware illinois maryland new jersey and pennsylvania and the district of columbia in addition rcra governs treatment storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and cleanup of sites where such activities were conducted 

our operations have in the past and may in the future require substantial expenditures in order to comply with these federal and state environmental laws under these laws we may be liable for the costs of remediating environmental contamination of property now or formerly owned by us and of property contaminated by hazardous substances generated by us we own or lease several real estate parcels including parcels on which our operations or the operations of others may have resulted in contamination by substances that are considered hazardous under environmental laws we are or could become in the future parties to proceedings initiated by the epa state agencies andor other responsible parties under cercla and rcra or similar state laws with respect to several sites or may undertake to investigate and remediate sites for which we may be subject to enforcement actions by an agency or thirdparty 

as of december 31 2021 we have established appropriate contingent liabilities for environmental remediation requirements in addition we may be required to make significant additional expenditures not presently determinable for other environmental remediation costs see note 3 — regulatory matters and note 19 — commitments and contingencies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our environmental matters remediation efforts and related impacts to our consolidated financial statements 

nuclear waste storage and disposal 

there are no facilities for the reprocessing or permanent disposal of snf currently in operation in the united states nor has the nrc licensed any such facilities we currently store all snf generated by our nuclear generating facilities onsite in storage pools or in dry cask storage facilities since our snf storage pools generally do not have sufficient storage capacity for the life of the respective plant we have developed dry cask storage facilities to support operations 

as of december 31 2021 we had approximately 89400 snf assemblies 21900 tons stored on site in snf pools or dry cask storage that includes snf assemblies at zion station for which we retain ownership and responsibility for the decommissioning of the zion independent spent fuel storage installation all our nuclear sites currently operating have onsite dry cask storage tmis onsite dry cask storage is projected to be in operation in 2022 onsite dry cask storage in concert with onsite storage pools will be capable of meeting all current and future snf storage requirements at our sites through the end of the current license renewal periods 

and through decommissioning for a discussion of matters associated with our contracts with the doe for the disposal of snf see note 19 — commitments and contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

as a byproduct of their operations nuclear generating units produce llrw llrw is accumulated at each generating station and permanently disposed of at licensed disposal facilities the federal lowlevel radioactive waste policy act of 1980 provides that states may enter into agreements to provide regional disposal facilities for llrw and restrict use of those facilities to waste generated within the region illinois and kentucky have entered into such an agreement although neither state currently has an operational site and none is anticipated to be operational for the next ten years we ship our class a llrw which represents 93 of llrw generated at our stations to disposal facilities in utah and south carolina which have enough storage capacity to store all class a llrw for the life of all stations in our nuclear fleet the disposal facility in south carolina at present is only receiving llrw from llrw generators in south carolina new jersey which includes salem and connecticut 

we utilize onsite storage capacity at all our stations to store and stage for shipping class b and class c llrw we have a contract through 2032 to ship class b and class c llrw to a disposal facility in texas the agreement provides for disposal of all class b and class c llrw currently stored at each station as well as the class b and class c llrw generated during the term of the agreement however because the production of llrw from our nuclear fleet will exceed the capacity at the texas site 39 million curies for 15 years beginning in 2012 we will still be required to utilize onsite storage at our stations for class b and class c llrw we currently have enough storage capacity to store all class b and class c llrw for the life of all stations in our nuclear fleet and continue to pursue alternative disposal strategies for llrw including an llrw reduction program to minimize onsite storage and cost impacts 




 item 1a risk factors tableend

we operate in a complex market and regulatory environment that involves significant risks many of which are beyond our direct control such risks which could negatively affect our consolidated financial statements fall primarily under the categories below 

risks related to market and financial factors primarily include 

• the price of fuels in particular the price of natural gas which affects power prices 

• the generation resources in the markets in which we operate 

• our ability to operate our generating assets our ability to access capital markets and the impacts on our results of operations due to the global outbreak pandemic of the 2019 novel coronavirus covid19 

• the impacts of ongoing competition and 

• emerging technologies and business models including those related to climate change mitigation and transition to a low carbon economy 

risks related to legislative regulatory and legal factors primarily include changes to and compliance with the laws and regulations that govern 

• the design of power markets 

• the renewal of permits and operating licenses 

• environmental and climate policy including zec and cmc programs and 

• tax policy 

risks related to operational factors primarily include 

• changes in the global climate could produce extreme weather events which could put our facilities at risk and such changes could also affect the levels and patterns of demand for energy and related services 

• the safe secure and effective operation of our nuclear facilities and the ability to effectively manage the associated decommissioning obligations 

• the ability of energy transmission and distribution companies to maintain the reliability resiliency and safety of their energy delivery systems which could affect our ability to deliver energy to our customers and affect our operating costs and 

• physical and cyber security risks for us as an owneroperator of generation facilities and as a participant in commodities trading 

risks related to our separation from exelon primarily include 

• challenges to achieving the benefits of separation including limited business diversification loss of economies of scale in sourcing goods and services and the need to replicate certain services provided by exelon such as treasury finance human resources investor relations legal information technology security and supply which will require additional resources and expense 

• performance by exelon and us under the transaction agreements including indemnification responsibilities tied to the allocation of businesses and liabilities and 

• limitations on future capitalraising or strategic transactions during the twoyear period following the distribution arising from the need to protect the taxfree treatment of the distribution 

risks related to our common stock primarily include 

• following the separation a trading market for our common stock will have only been initiated recently and our stock price may fluctuate significantly and 

• certain antitakeover provisions in our charter and bylaws that could have the effect of delaying or discouraging an acquisition of our company or a change in our management 

risks related to market and financial factors 

we are exposed to price volatility associated with both the wholesale and retail power markets and the procurement of nuclear and fossil fuels 

we are exposed to commodity price risk for natural gas and the unhedged portion of our electricity generation supply portfolio our earnings and cash flows are therefore exposed to variability of spot and forward market prices in the markets in which we operate 

price of fuels the spot market price of electricity for each hour is generally determined by the marginal cost of supplying the next unit of electricity to the market during that hour thus the market price of power is affected by the market price of the marginal fuel used to generate the electricity unit 

cost of fuel we depend on nuclear fuel and fossil fuels to operate most of our generating facilities the supply markets for nuclear fuel natural gas and oil are subject to price fluctuations availability restrictions counterparty default and geopolitical risk including the current russia ukraine conflict and united states sanctions against russia 

demand and supply the market price for electricity is also affected by changes in the demand for electricity and the available supply of electricity unfavorable economic conditions milder than normal weather and the growth of energy efficiency and demand response programs can depress demand in addition in some markets the supply of electricity can exceed demand during some hours of the day resulting in loss of revenue for baseload generating plants such as our nuclear plants conversely new demand sources such as electrification of transportation could increase demand and change demand patterns 

retail competition our retail operations compete for customers in a competitive environment which affects the margins we can earn and the volumes we are able to serve in periods of sustained low natural gas and power prices and low market volatility retail competitors can aggressively pursue market share because the barriers to entry can be low and wholesale generators including us use their retail operations to hedge generation output 

the impact of sustained low market prices or depressed demand and oversupply could be emphasized given our concentration of baseload electric generating capacity within primarily two geographic market regions namely the midwest and the midatlantic these impacts could adversely affect our ability to reduce debt and provide attractive shareholder returns in addition such conditions may no longer support the continued operation of certain generating facilities which could adversely affect our financial statements primarily through accelerated depreciation and amortization expenses and onetime charges see note 7 — early plant retirements of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

market designs the wholesale markets vary from region to region with distinct rules practices and procedures changes in these market rules problems with rule implementation or failure of any of these markets could adversely affect our business in addition a significant decrease in market participation could affect market liquidity and have a detrimental effect on market stability 

we are potentially affected by emerging technologies that could over time affect or transform the energy industry 

advancements in power generation technology including commercial and residential solar generation installations and commercial micro turbine installations are improving the costeffectiveness of customer selfsupply of electricity improvements in energy storage technology including batteries and fuel cells could also better position customers to meet their aroundtheclock electricity requirements improvements in energy efficiency of lighting appliances equipment and building materials will also affect energy consumption by customers changes in power generation storage and use technologies could have significant effects on customer behaviors and their energy consumption 

these developments could affect the price of energy levels of customerowned generation customer expectations and current business models and make portions of our generation facilities uneconomic prior to the end of their useful lives these technologies could also result in further declines in commodity prices or demand for delivered energy each of these factors could affect our consolidated financial statements through among other things reduced operating revenues increased operating and maintenance expenses increased capital expenditures and potential asset impairment charges or accelerated depreciation and decommissioning expenses over shortened remaining asset useful lives 

market performance and other factors could decrease the value of our ndt funds and employee benefit plan assets which then could require significant additional funding 

disruptions in the capital markets and their actual or perceived effects on particular businesses and the greater economy could adversely affect the value of the investments held within our ndts and employee benefit plan trusts we have significant obligations in these areas and hold substantial assets in these trusts to meet those obligations the asset values are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns which could fall below our projected return rates a decline in the market value of the ndt fund investments could increase our funding requirements to decommission our nuclear plants a decline in the market value of the pension and opeb plan assets would increase the funding requirements associated with our pension and opeb plan obligations additionally our pension and opeb plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates as interest rates decrease the liabilities increase potentially increasing benefit costs and funding requirements changes in demographics including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions or changes to social security or medicare eligibility requirements could also increase the costs and funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension and opeb plans see note 10 — asset retirement obligations and note 15 — retirement benefits of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

we could be negatively affected by unstable capital and credit markets and increased volatility in commodity markets 

we rely on the capital markets particularly for publicly offered debt as well as the banking and commercial paper markets to meet our financial commitments and shortterm liquidity needs disruptions in the capital and credit markets in the united states or abroad could negatively affect our ability to access the capital markets or draw on our bank revolving credit facilities the banks may not be able to meet their funding commitments to us if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests within a short period of time the inability to access capital markets or credit facilities and longerterm disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty changing or increased regulation reduced alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions could result in the deferral of discretionary capital expenditures affect our ability to hedge effectively our generation portfolio require changes to our hedging strategy in order to reduce collateral posting requirements or require a reduction in discretionary uses of cash in addition we have exposure to worldwide financial markets including europe canada and asia disruptions in these markets could reduce or restrict our ability to secure sufficient liquidity or secure liquidity at reasonable terms as of december 31 2021 approximately 26 19 and 17 of our available credit facilities were with european canadian and asian banks respectively 

the strength and depth of competition in energy markets depend heavily on active participation by multiple trading parties which could be negatively affected by disruptions in the capital and credit markets and legislative and regulatory initiatives that could affect participants in commodities transactions reduced capital and liquidity and failures of significant institutions that participate in the energy markets could diminish the liquidity and competitiveness of energy markets that are important to our business perceived weaknesses in the competitive strength of the energy markets could lead to pressures for greater regulation of those markets or attempts to replace market structures with other mechanisms for the sale of power including the requirement of longterm contracts 

if we were to experience a downgrade in our credit ratings to below investment grade or otherwise fail to satisfy the credit standards in our agreements with our counterparties or regulatory financial requirements we would be required to provide significant amounts of collateral that could affect our liquidity and we could experience higher borrowing costs 

our business is subject to credit quality standards that could require market participants to post collateral for their obligations upon a decline in ratings we are also subject to certain financial requirements under nrc regulations as a result of our operation of nuclear power plants that could require us to provide cash collateral or surety bonds if those requirements are not met one or both events could adversely affect available liquidity and in the case of a rating downgrade borrowing and credit support costs 

see item 7managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – liquidity and capital resources – credit matters – market conditions and security ratings for additional information regarding the potential impacts of credit downgrades on our cash flows 

if we fail to meet projectspecific financing agreement requirements we could experience an impairment or loss of the financed project 

we have projectspecific financing arrangements and must meet the requirements of various agreements relating to those financings failure to meet those arrangements could give rise to a projectspecific financing default which if not cured or waived could result in the specific project being required to repay the associated debt or other borrowings earlier than otherwise anticipated and if such repayment were not made the lenders or security holders would generally have broad remedies including rights to foreclose against the project assets and related collateral or to force our subsidiaries in the projectspecific financings to enter into bankruptcy proceedings the impact of bankruptcy could result in the impairment of certain project assets 

our risk management policies cannot fully eliminate the risk associated with our commodity trading activities 

our assetbased power position as well as our power marketing fuel procurement and other commodity trading activities expose us to risks of commodity price movements we buy and sell energy and other products and enter financial contracts to manage risk and hedge various positions in our power generation portfolio we are exposed to volatility in financial results for unhedged positions as well as the risk of ineffective hedges we attempt to manage this exposure through enforcement of established risk limits and risk management 

procedures these risk limits and risk management procedures may not work as planned and cannot eliminate all risks associated with these activities even when our policies and procedures are followed and decisions are made based on projections and estimates of future performance results of operations could be diminished if the judgments and assumptions underlying those decisions prove to be incorrect factors such as future prices and demand for power natural gas and other energyrelated commodities become more difficult to predict and the calculations become less reliable the further into the future estimates are made as a result we cannot predict the impact that our commodity trading activities and risk management decisions could have on our consolidated financial statements 

financial performance and load requirements could be negatively affected if we are unable to effectively manage our power portfolio 

a significant portion of our power portfolio is used to provide power under procurement contracts with load serving entities and other customers to the extent portions of the power portfolio are not needed for that purpose our output is sold in the wholesale power markets to the extent our power portfolio is not sufficient to meet the requirements of our customers under the related agreements we must purchase power in the wholesale power markets our financial results could be negatively affected if we are unable to meet costeffectively the load requirements of our customers manage our power portfolio or effectively address the changes in the wholesale power markets 

the impacts of significant economic downturns could lead to decreased volumes delivered and increased expense for uncollectible customer balances 

the impacts of significant economic downturns on our retail customers such as less demand for products and services provided by commercial and industrial customers could result in an increase in the number of uncollectible customer balances and related expense 

see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information on our credit risk 

our results were negatively affected by the impacts of covid19 

covid19 has disrupted economic activity in our markets and negatively affected our results of operations the estimated impact of covid19 to our net income was approximately 170 million for the year ended december 31 2020 and was not material for the year ended december 31 2021 we cannot predict the full extent of the impacts of covid19 which will depend on among other things the rate and public perceptions of the effectiveness of vaccinations and rate of resumption of business activity in addition any future widespread pandemic or other local or global health issue could adversely affect customer demand and our ability to operate our generation assets see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – executive overview for additional information 

we could be negatively affected by the impacts of weather 

our operations are affected by weather which impacts demand for electricity and natural gas the price of energy commodities as well as operating conditions to the extent that weather is warmer in the summer or colder in the winter than assumed we could require greater resources to meet our contractual commitments extreme weather conditions or storms have affected the availability of generation and its transmission limiting our ability to source or send power to where it is sold and have also impaired the transportation of natural gas to our generating assets and our ability to supply natural gas to our customers in addition droughtlike conditions limiting water usage could impact our ability to run certain generating assets at full capacity these conditions which cannot be accurately predicted could cause us to seek additional capacity at a time when markets are weak 

climate change projections suggest increases to summer temperature and humidity trends as well as more erratic precipitation and storm patterns over the longterm in the areas where we have generation assets the frequency in which weather conditions emerge outside the current expected climate norms could contribute to the weatherrelated impacts discussed above 

beginning on february 15 2021 our texasbased generating assets within the ercot market specifically colorado bend ii wolf hollow ii and handley experienced periodic outages as a result of historically severe cold weather conditions the estimated impact to our net income arising from these market and weather conditions for the year ended december 31 2021 was a reduction of approximately  800 million see note 3 — regulatory matters of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

longlived assets and other assets could become impaired 

longlived assets – principally generation assets – represent the single largest asset class on our statement of financial position 

we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of longlived assets to be held and used whenever events or circumstances indicating a potential impairment may exist factors such as but not limited to the business climate including current and future energy and market conditions environmental regulation and the condition of assets are considered 

an impairment would require us to reduce the carrying value of the longlived asset to fair value through a noncash charge to expense by the amount of the impairment see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – critical accounting policies and estimates note 8 — property plant and equipment and note 12 — asset impairments of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on longlived asset impairments 

we could incur substantial costs in the event of nonperformance by thirdparties under indemnification agreements or when we have guaranteed their performance we are exposed to other credit risks in the power markets that are beyond our control 

we have entered into various agreements with counterparties that require those counterparties to reimburse us and hold us harmless against specified obligations and claims to the extent that any of these counterparties are affected by deterioration in their creditworthiness or the agreements are otherwise determined to be unenforceable we could be held responsible for the obligations 

we have issued indemnities to third parties regarding environmental or other matters in connection with purchases and sales of assets including several of the exelon utilities in connection with our absorption of their former generating assets we could incur substantial costs to fulfill our obligations under these indemnities 

we have issued guarantees for the performance of third parties which obligate us to perform if the third parties do not perform in the event of nonperformance by those third parties we could incur substantial costs to fulfill their obligations under these guarantees 

in the bilateral markets we are exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe us money or are obligated to purchase energy or fuel from us will not perform under their obligations for operational or financial reasons in the event the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform we could be forced to purchase or sell energy or fuel in the wholesale markets at less favorable prices and incur additional losses to the extent amounts if any were already paid to the counterparties in the spot markets we are exposed to risk as a result of default sharing mechanisms that exist within certain markets primarily rtos and isos we are also a party to agreements with entities in the energy sector that have experienced rating downgrades or other financial difficulties in addition our retail sales subject us to credit risk through competitive electricity and natural gas supply activities to serve commercial and industrial companies governmental entities and residential customers retail credit risk results when customers default on their contractual obligations this risk represents the loss that could be incurred due to the nonpayment of a customer’s account balance as well as the loss from the resale of energy previously committed to serve the customer see note 3 — regulatory matters of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the february 2021 extreme cold weather event and texasbased generating asset outages 

risks related to legislative regulatory and legal factors 

federal or state legislative or regulatory actions could negatively affect the scope and functioning of the wholesale markets 

approximately 65 of our generating resources which include directly owned assets and capacity obtained through longterm contracts are in the area encompassed by pjm our future results of operations are impacted by 1 ferc’s and pjms level of support for policies that favor the preservation of competitive wholesale power markets and recognize the value of carbonfree electricity and resiliency and for states energy objectives and policies and 2 the absence of material changes to market structures that would limit or otherwise negatively affect us market rules in other regions could affect us in a similar fashion we could also be affected by state laws regulations or initiatives to subsidize existing or new generation 

ferc’s requirements for marketbased rate authority could pose a risk that we may no longer satisfy ferc’s tests for marketbased rates a loss of marketbased rate authority would mean that we would sell power at costbased rates 

our business is highly regulated and could be negatively affected by legislative andor regulatory actions 

substantial aspects of our business are subject to comprehensive federal or state legislation andor regulation 

our consolidated financial statements are significantly affected by our sales and purchases of commodities at marketbased rates as opposed to costbased or other similarly regulated rates and federal and state regulatory and legislative developments related to emissions climate change capacity market mitigation energy price information resilience fuel diversity and rps legislative and regulatory efforts in illinois new york and new jersey to preserve the environmental attributes and reliability benefits of zeroemission nuclearpowered generating facilities through zec and cmc programs are or could be subject to legal and regulatory challenges and if overturned could result in the early retirement of certain of our nuclear plants see note 3 — regulatory matters and note 7 — early plant retirements of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

fundamental changes in regulations or other adverse legislative actions affecting our business would require changes in our business planning models and operations we cannot predict when or whether legislative and regulatory proposals could become law or what their effect would be 

nrc actions could negatively affect the operations and profitability of our nuclear generating fleet 

regulatory risk a change in the atomic energy act or the applicable regulations or licenses could require a substantial increase in capital expenditures or could result in increased operating or decommissioning costs events at nuclear plants owned by others as well as those owned by us could cause the nrc to initiate such actions 

spent nuclear fuel storage the approval of a national repository for the storage of snf and the timing of that facility opening will significantly affect the costs associated with storage of snf and the ultimate amounts received from the doe to reimburse us for these costs 

any regulatory action relating to the timing and availability of a repository for snf could adversely affect our ability to decommission fully our nuclear units we cannot predict whether a fee may be established or to what extent in the future for snf disposal see note 19 — commitments and contingencies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

we could be subject to higher costs andor penalties related to mandatory reliability standards 

we as a user of the bulk power transmission system are subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by nerc and enforced by ferc the standards are based on the functions that need to be performed to ensure the bulk power system operates reliably and are guided by reliability and market interface principles compliance with or changes in the reliability standards could subject us to higher operating costs andor increased capital expenditures if we were found in noncompliance with the federal and state mandatory reliability standards we could be subject to remediation costs as well as sanctions which could include substantial monetary penalties 

we could incur substantial costs to fulfill our obligations related to environmental and other matters 

we are subject to extensive environmental regulation and legislation by local state and federal authorities these laws and regulations affect the way we conduct our operations and make capital expenditures including how we handle air and water emissions hazardous and solid waste and activities affecting surface waters groundwater and aquatic and other species violations of these requirements could subject us to enforcement actions capital expenditures to bring existing facilities into compliance additional operating costs for remediation and cleanup costs civil penalties and exposure to third parties’ claims for alleged health or property damages or operating restrictions to achieve compliance in addition we are subject to liability under these laws for the remediation costs for environmental contamination of property now or formerly owned by us and of property contaminated by hazardous substances we generated or released also we are currently involved in several proceedings relating to sites where hazardous substances have been deposited and could be subject to additional proceedings in the future see item 1 business – environmental matters and regulation and note 19 — commitments and contingencies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

we could be negatively affected by federal and state rps andor energy conservation legislation along with energy conservation by customers 

changes to current state legislation or the development of federal legislation that requires the use of clean renewable and alternate fuel sources could significantly impact us the impact could include reduced use of some of our generating facilities with effects on our revenues and costs 

federal and state legislation mandating the implementation of energy conservation programs and new energy consumption technologies could cause declines in customer energy consumption and lead to a decline in our revenues see item 1 business – environmental matters and regulation – renewable and clean energy standards and “we are potentially affected by emerging technologies that could over time affect or transform the energy industry” above for additional information 

our financial performance could be negatively affected by risks arising from our ownership and operation of hydroelectric facilities 

ferc has the exclusive authority to license most nonfederal hydropower projects located on navigable waterways federal lands or connected to the interstate electric grid if ferc does not issue new operating licenses for our hydroelectric facilities in the future or a station cannot be operated through the end of its current operating license our results of operations could be adversely affected by increased depreciation rates and accelerated future decommissioning costs since depreciation rates and decommissioning cost estimates are currently based on the available license term for each facility we could also lose revenue and incur increased fuel and purchased power expense to meet our supply commitments in addition conditions could be imposed as part of the license renewal process that could adversely affect operations require a substantial increase in capital expenditures result in increased operating costs or render the project uneconomic similar effects could result from a change in the federal power act or the applicable regulations due to events at hydroelectric facilities owned by others as well as those owned by us 

we could be negatively affected by challenges to tax positions taken tax law changes and the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions 

we are required to make judgments in order to estimate our obligations to taxing authorities these tax obligations include income real estate sales and use and employmentrelated taxes and ongoing appeal issues related to these tax matters these judgments include reserves established for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken that could be subject to challenge by the tax authorities see note 1 — significant accounting policies and note 14 — income taxes of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

legal proceedings could result in a negative outcome which we cannot predict 

we are involved in legal proceedings claims and litigation arising from our business operations the material ones are summarized in note 19 — commitments and contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial 

statements adverse outcomes in these proceedings could require significant expenditures result in lost revenue or restrict existing business activities 

we could be subject to adverse publicity and reputational risks which make us vulnerable to negative customer perception and could lead to increased regulatory oversight or other consequences 

we could be the subject of public criticism adverse publicity of this nature could render public service commissions and other regulatory and legislative authorities less likely to view energy companies in a favorable light and could cause those companies including us to be susceptible to less favorable legislative and regulatory outcomes as well as increased regulatory oversight and more stringent legislative or regulatory requirements 

risks related to operational factors 

we are subject to risks associated with climate change 

climate adaptation risk refers to risks to our facilities or operations that may result from changes in the physical climate such as changes to temperatures weather patterns and sea level rise 

we periodically perform analyses to better understand how climate change could affect our facilities and operations we primarily operate in the midwest and east coast of the united states areas that have historically been prone to various types of severe weather events and as such we have welldeveloped response and recovery programs based on these historical events however our physical facilities could be placed at greater risk of damage should changes in the global climate impact temperature and weather patterns and result in more intense frequent and extreme weather events unprecedented levels of precipitation sea level rise increased surface water temperatures andor other effects over time we may need to make additional investments to protect our facilities from physical climaterelated risks 

in addition changes to the climate may impact levels and patterns of demand for energy and related services which could affect our operations over time we may need to make additional investments to adapt to changes in operational requirements as a result of climate change 

climate mitigation and transition risks include changes to the energy systems as a result of new technologies changing customer expectations andor voluntary ghg goals as well as local state or federal regulatory requirements intended to reduce ghg emissions 

we also periodically perform analyses of potential pathways to reduce power sector and economywide ghg emissions to mitigate climate change to the extent additional ghg reduction regulation or legislation becomes effective at the federal andor state levels we could incur costs to further limit the ghg emissions from our operations or otherwise comply with applicable requirements to the extent such additional regulation or legislation does not become effective the potential competitive advantage offered by our lowcarbon emission profile may be reduced 

see item 1 business – environmental matters and regulation – climate change for additional information 

our financial performance could be negatively affected by matters arising from our ownership and operation of nuclear facilities 

nuclear capacity factors capacity factors for nuclear generating units significantly affect our results of operations lower capacity factors could decrease our revenues and increase operating costs by requiring us to produce additional energy from our natural gas and oil fueled facilities or purchase additional energy in the spot or forward markets in order to satisfy our supply obligations to committed thirdparty sales these sources generally have higher costs than we incur to produce energy from our nuclear stations 

nuclear refueling outages in general refueling outages are planned to occur once every 18 to 24 months the total number of refueling outages along with their duration could have a significant impact on our results of operations when refueling outages last longer than anticipated or we experience unplanned outages capacity 

factors decrease and we face lower margins due to higher energy replacement costs andor lower energy sales and higher operating and maintenance costs 

nuclear fuel quality the quality of nuclear fuel utilized by us could affect the efficiency and costs of our operations remediation actions could result in increased costs due to accelerated fuel amortization increased outage costs andor increased costs due to decreased generation capabilities 

operational risk operations at any of our nuclear generation plants could degrade to the point where we must shut down the plant or operate at less than full capacity if this were to happen identifying and correcting the causes could require significant time and expense we could choose to close a plant rather than incur the expense of restarting it or returning the plant to full capacity in either event we could lose revenue and incur increased purchased power and fuel expense to meet supply commitments 

further our nuclear operations produce various types of nuclear waste materials including snf the approval of a national repository for the storage of snf and the timing of that facility opening will significantly affect the costs associated with storage of snf and the ultimate amounts received from the doe to reimburse us for these costs any regulatory action relating to the timing and availability of a repository for snf could adversely affect our ability to decommission fully our nuclear units we cannot predict whether a fee may be established or to what extent in the future for snf disposal 

if we are required to arrange for the safe and permanent disposal of spent fuel beyond current expectations this could lead to substantial expense or capital expenditures 

for plants operated but not wholly owned by us we could also incur liability to the coowners for nuclear plants not operated and not wholly owned by us from which we receive a portion of the plants’ output our results of operations are dependent on the operational performance of the operators and could be adversely affected by a significant event at those plants additionally poor operating performance at nuclear plants not owned by us could result in increased regulation and reduced public support for nuclearfueled energy closure of generating plants owned by others or extended interruptions of generating plants or failure of transmission lines could adversely affect transmission systems and the sale and delivery of electricity in markets served by us 

nuclear major incident risk and insurance the consequences of a major incident could be severe and include loss of life and property damage any resulting liability from a nuclear plant major incident within the united states owned or operated by us or owned by others could exceed our resources including insurance coverage we are a member of an industry mutual insurance company neil which provides property and business interruption insurance for our nuclear operations uninsured losses and other expenses to the extent not recovered from insurers or the nuclear industry could be borne by us additionally an accident or other significant event at a nuclear plant within the united states or abroad whether owned by us or others could result in increased regulation and reduced public support for nuclearfueled energy 

as required by the priceanderson act we carry the maximum available amount of nuclear liability insurance  450 million for each operating site claims exceeding that amount are covered through mandatory participation in a financial protection pool in addition the us congress could impose revenueraising measures on the nuclear industry to pay claims exceeding the  135 billion limit for a single incident 

see note 19 — commitments and contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information of nuclear insurance 

decommissioning obligation and funding nrc regulations require that licensees of nuclear generating facilities demonstrate reasonable assurance that funds will be available in certain minimum amounts at the end of the life of the facility to decommission the facility 

we recognize as a liability the present value of the estimated future costs to decommission our nuclear facilities the estimated liability is based on assumptions in the approach and timing of decommissioning the nuclear facilities estimation of decommissioning costs and federal and state regulatory requirements the costs of such decommissioning may substantially exceed such liability as facts circumstances or our estimates may change including changes in the approach and timing of decommissioning activities changes in decommissioning costs changes in federal or state regulatory requirements on the decommissioning of such facilities other changes in our estimates or ability to effectively execute on our planned decommissioning activities 

we make contributions to certain trust funds of the former peco units based on amounts being collected by peco from its customers and remitted to us while we through peco have recourse to collect additional amounts from peco customers subject to certain limitations and thresholds we have no recourse to collect additional amounts from utility customers for any of our other nuclear units if there is a shortfall of funds necessary for decommissioning if circumstances changed such that there was an inability to continue to make contributions to the trust funds of the former peco units based on amounts collected from peco customers or if we no longer had recourse to collect additional amounts from peco customers if there was a shortfall of funds for decommissioning the adequacy of the trust funds related to the former peco units could be negatively affected any changes to the peco regulatory agreements could impact our ability to offset decommissioningrelated activities within the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income and the impact to our financial statements could be material 

should the expected value of the ndt fund for any former comed unit fall below the amount of the expected decommissioning obligation for that unit the accounting to offset decommissioningrelated activities for that unit would be discontinued and the decommissioningrelated activities would be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income the impact of which could be material for the year ended december 31 2021 a pretax charge of 193 million was recorded in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for decommissioningrelated activities that were not offset for the byron units due to contractual offset being temporarily suspended 

forecasting trust fund investment earnings and costs to decommission nuclear generating stations requires significant judgment and actual results could differ significantly from current estimates if the investments held by our ndt funds are not sufficient to fund the decommissioning of our nuclear units we could be required to take steps such as providing financial guarantees through letters of credit or parent company guarantees or making additional contributions to the trusts which could be significant to ensure that the trusts are adequately funded and that current and future nrc minimum funding requirements are met 

see note 10 — asset retirement obligations of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

we are subject to physical security and cybersecurity risks 

we face physical security and cybersecurity risks threat sources continue to seek to exploit potential vulnerabilities in the electric generation and natural gas industry associated with protection of sensitive and confidential information grid infrastructure and other energy infrastructures these attacks and disruptions both physical and cyber are becoming increasingly sophisticated and dynamic continued implementation of advanced digital technologies increases the potentially unfavorable impacts of such attacks 

a security breach of our physical assets or information systems or those of our competitors vendors business partners and interconnected entities in rtos and isos or regulators could impact the operation of the generation fleet andor reliability of the transmission and distribution system or result in the theft or inappropriate release of certain types of information including critical infrastructure information sensitive customer vendor and employee data trading or other confidential data the risk of these systemrelated events and security breaches occurring continues to intensify and while we have not directly experienced a material breach or disruption to our network or information systems or our operations todate such attacks continue to increase in sophistication and frequency and we may be unable to prevent all such attacks in the future 

if a significant breach were to occur our reputation could be negatively affected customer confidence in us or others in the industry could be diminished or we could be subject to legal claims loss of revenues increased costs or operations shutdown moreover the amount and scope of insurance maintained against losses resulting from any such events or security breaches may not be sufficient to cover losses or otherwise adequately compensate for any disruptions to business that could result 

in addition new or updated security regulations or unforeseen threat sources could require changes in current measures taken by us or our business operations and could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements 

our employees contractors customers and the general public could be exposed to a risk of injury due to the nature of the energy industry 

employees and contractors throughout the organization work in and the general public could be exposed to potentially dangerous environments near our operations as a result employees contractors and the general public are at some risk for serious injury including loss of life these risks include but are not limited to nuclear accidents dam failure gas explosions and electric contact cases 

natural disasters war acts and threats of terrorism pandemic and other significant events could negatively impact our results of operations ability to raise capital and future growth 

our fleet of power plants and the transmission infrastructure to which they are connected could be affected by natural disasters and extreme weather events which could result in increased costs including supply chain costs natural disasters and other significant events increase our risk that the nrc or other regulatory or legislative bodies could change the laws or regulations governing among other things operations maintenance licensed lives decommissioning snf storage insurance emergency planning security and environmental and radiological matters in addition natural disasters could affect the availability of a secure and economical supply of water in some locations which is essential for our continued operation particularly the cooling of generating units 

the impact that potential terrorist attacks could have on the industry and on us is uncertain we face a risk that our operations would be direct targets or indirect casualties of an act of terror any retaliatory military strikes or sustained military campaign could affect our operations in unpredictable ways such as changes in insurance markets and disruptions of fuel supplies and markets particularly uranium and oil furthermore these catastrophic events could compromise the physical or cybersecurity of our facilities which could adversely affect our ability to manage our business effectively instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism war natural disasters pandemic credit crises recession or other factors also could result in a decline in energy consumption or interruption of fuel or the supply chain in addition the implementation of security guidelines and measures has resulted in and is expected to continue to result in increased costs 

we could be significantly affected by the outbreak of a pandemic we have plans in place to respond to a pandemic however depending on the severity of a pandemic and the resulting impacts to workforce and other resource availability the ability to operate our generating assets could be adversely affected 

in addition we maintain a level of insurance coverage consistent with industry practices against property casualty and cybersecurity losses subject to unforeseen occurrences or catastrophic events that could damage or destroy assets or interrupt operations however there can be no assurance that the amount of insurance will be adequate to address such property and casualty losses 

our business is capital intensive and our assets could require significant expenditures to maintain and are subject to operational failure which could result in potential liability 

our business is capital intensive and requires significant investments in electric generating facilities equipment even if maintained in accordance with good utility practices is subject to operational failure including events that are beyond our control and could require significant expenditures to remedy our consolidated financial statements could be negatively affected if we were unable to effectively manage our capital projects or raise the necessary capital see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – liquidity and capital resources for additional information regarding our potential future capital expenditures 

our performance could be negatively affected if we fail to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce 

certain events such as the separation transaction an employee strike loss of employees loss of contract resources due to a major event and an aging workforce without appropriate replacements could lead to operating challenges and increased costs for us the challenges include lack of resources loss of knowledge and a lengthy time period associated with skill development in this case costs including costs for contractors to replace employees productivity costs and safety costs could arise we are particularly affected due to the specialized knowledge required of the technical and support employees for generation operations 

we could make acquisitions or investments in new business initiatives and new markets which may not be successful or achieve the intended financial results 

we could continue to pursue growth in our existing businesses and markets and further diversification across the competitive energy value chain this could include opportunistic carbonfree energy acquisitions creating new value from our existing fleet through repowering colocation and the production of hydrogen growing sustainability products and services for our customers and investment opportunities in other emerging technologies and innovation such initiatives could involve significant risks and uncertainties including distraction of management from current operations inadequate return on capital and unidentified issues not discovered during diligence performed prior to launching an initiative or entering a market additionally it is possible that ferc state public utility commissions or others could impose certain other restrictions on such transactions all these factors could result in higher costs or lower revenues than expected resulting in lower than planned returns on investment 

risks related to our separation from exelon 

following the separation our financial profile has changed and we are a smaller less diversified company than exelon prior to the separation 

the separation resulted in us being a smaller less diversified company as a result we may be more vulnerable to changing market conditions which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition the diversification of our revenues costs and cash flows will diminish as a standalone company such that our results of operations cash flows working capital and financing requirements may be subject to increased volatility and our ability to fund capital expenditures and investments pay dividends and service debt may be diminished 

we may not achieve some or all the expected benefits of the separation and the separation may materially adversely affect our business 

we may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits expected to result from the separation or such benefits may be delayed or not occur at all 

if we fail to achieve some or all the benefits expected to result from the separation or if such benefits are delayed it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the terms in our agreements with exelon could be less beneficial than the terms we may have otherwise received from unaffiliated third parties 

the agreements entered with exelon in connection with the separation including the separation agreement a tax matters agreement an employee matters agreement and a transition services agreement were prepared in the context of the separation while we were still a wholly owned subsidiary of exelon accordingly during the period in which the terms of those agreements were prepared we did not have an independent board of directors or a management team that was independent of exelon as a result the terms of those agreements may not reflect terms that would have resulted from negotiations between unaffiliated third parties 

exelon may fail to perform under various transaction agreements that were executed as part of the separation which could cause us to incur expenses or losses we would not otherwise incur 

in connection with the separation and prior to the distribution we and exelon entered into the separation agreement and entered into various other agreements including a tax matters agreement an employee matters agreement and a transition services agreement the separation agreement the tax matters agreement and the employee matters agreement determined the allocation of assets and liabilities between the companies following the separation for those respective areas and include any necessary indemnifications related to liabilities and obligations we will rely on exelon to satisfy its performance and payment obligations under these agreements if exelon is unable or unwilling to satisfy its obligations under these agreements including its indemnification obligations we could incur operational difficulties andor losses 

in connection with the separation into two public companies we and exelon indemnified each other for certain liabilities if we are required to pay under these indemnities to exelon our 

financial results could be negatively impacted the exelon indemnities may not be sufficient to hold us harmless from the full amount of liabilities for which exelon will be allocated responsibility and exelon may not be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations in the future 

pursuant to the separation agreement and certain other agreements between exelon and us each party will agree to indemnify the other for certain liabilities in each case for uncapped amounts indemnities that we may be required to provide exelon are not subject to any cap may be significant and could negatively impact our business third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that exelon has agreed to retain any amounts we are required to pay pursuant to these indemnification obligations and other liabilities could require us to divert cash that would otherwise have been used in furtherance of our operating business further the indemnities from exelon for our benefit may not be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities and exelon may not be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations 

moreover even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from exelon any amounts for which we are held liable we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves each of these risks could negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may fail to have necessary systems and services in place when certain of the transaction agreements expire 

if we do not have in place our own systems and services or if we do not have agreements with other providers of these services once certain separation transaction agreements expire we may not be able to operate our business effectively and our profitability may decline we are in the process of creating our own or engaging third parties to provide systems and services to replace many of the systems and services that exelon currently provides to us we may incur temporary interruptions in business operations if we cannot transition effectively from exelon’s existing operating systems databases and programming languages that support these functions to our own systems our failure to implement the new systems and transition our data successfully and costeffectively could disrupt our business operations and have a material adverse effect on our profitability in addition our costs for the operation of these systems may be higher than the amounts reflected in our historical financial statements 

we may not be able to engage in desirable strategic transactions or capitalraising following the separation 

under current us federal income tax law a spinoff that otherwise qualifies for taxfree treatment can be rendered taxable to the parent corporation and its shareholders as a result of certain postspinoff transactions including certain acquisitions of shares or assets of the spunoff corporation to preserve the taxfree treatment of the distribution and in addition to potential tax indemnity obligations we agreed to certain limitations or prohibitions in the tax matters agreement that may prohibit us for the twoyear period following the distribution and except in specific circumstances from among other things 

• entering into any transaction pursuant to which all or a portion of the shares of our stock or substantially all of our assets would be acquired whether by merger or otherwise 

• issuing equity securities beyond certain thresholds 

• repurchasing shares of our stock other than in certain openmarket transactions 

the tax matters agreement prohibits us from taking or failing to take any other action that would prevent the distribution and certain related transactions from qualifying as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the irc these restrictions may limit our ability to pursue certain equity issuances strategic transactions repurchases or other transactions that we may believe to be in the best interests of our shareholders or that might increase the value of our business 

risks related to our common stock 

a trading market for our common stock was only recently initiated following the separation and our stock price may fluctuate significantly 

an active trading market for our common stock was only recently initiated following the separation which may affect your ability to sell your shares and could lead to our share price being depressed or more volatile for many reasons including the risks identified in this “risk factors” section the market price of our common stock following the separation may be more volatile than the market price of exelon’s common stock before the separation these factors may result in shortterm or longterm negative pressure on the value of our common stock 

we cannot predict the prices at which our common stock may trade the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly depending on many factors including the following 

• our announcements or our competitors’ announcements regarding new products or services enhancements significant contracts acquisitions or strategic investments 

• fluctuations in our quarterly or annual financial results or the quarterly or annual financial results of companies perceived to be similar to us 

• changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates 

• the operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies 

• investors’ general perception of us and our industry 

• changes to the regulatory and legal environment under which we operate 

• changes in general economic and market conditions and 

• changes in industry conditions 

in addition if the market for stocks in our industry or the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business financial condition or results of operations if any of the foregoing occurs it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to lawsuits that even if successfully defended could be costly to defend and a distraction to management 

antitakeover provisions could enable us to resist a takeover attempt by a thirdparty 

our amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain and pennsylvania law contains provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover 

we believe these provisions will protect our shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors and by providing our board of directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal these provisions are not intended to make us immune from takeovers however these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in the best interests of us and our shareholders these provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors see “description of common stock — certain antitakeover provisions” in the form 10 

in addition an acquisition or further issuance of our stock could trigger the application of section 355e of the irc causing the distribution to be taxable to exelon for a discussion of section 355e of the irc see “the separation — material us federal income tax consequences of the separation” in the form 10 under the tax matters agreement we would be required to indemnify exelon for the resulting tax and this indemnity obligation might discourage delay or prevent a change of control that our shareholders may consider favorable 

our amended and restated articles of incorporation designate the state courts of the commonwealth of pennsylvania or if such state courts do not have jurisdiction the federal district courts located within the commonwealth of pennsylvania as the sole and exclusive 

forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders and the united states federal district courts as the exclusive forum for claims under the securities act which could limit our shareholders’ ability to obtain what such shareholders believe to be a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors officers or employees 

our amended and restated articles of incorporation provide that unless our board of directors consents in writing to an alternative forum a state court within the commonwealth of pennsylvania or if no such state court has jurisdiction a federal district court within the commonwealth of pennsylvania will be the sole and exclusive forum for 1 any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the company including any derivative suit brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the exchange act 2 any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director officer or employee of the company to the company or its shareholders 3 any action asserting a claim against the company or any of its directors officers or employees arising pursuant to any provision of the pennsylvania business corporation law the “pbcl” or as to which the pbcl confers jurisdiction on the pennsylvania courts of common pleas or the amended and restated articles of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws or 4 any action asserting a claim against the company or any of its directors officers or employees governed by the internal affairs doctrine the amended and restated articles of incorporation also provide that unless our board of directors consents in writing to an alternative forum the federal district courts of the united states of america will be the sole and exclusive forum for the resolution of any action asserting a cause of action arising under the securities act 

although the amended and restated articles of incorporation include these exclusive forum provisions it is possible that a court could rule that these provisions are inapplicable or unenforceable our exclusive forum provision will apply to derivative suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the exchange act and investors cannot waive compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder these exclusive provisions may limit a shareholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that the shareholder believes to be favorable for disputes with us or our directors officers or other employees which may discourage such lawsuits it is possible that a court could find these exclusive forum provisions inapplicable or unenforceable with respect to one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings and we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and result in a diversion of the time and resources of our management and board of directors

executive overview 

we are a supplier of clean energy our generating capacity consists of nuclear wind solar natural gas and hydroelectric assets through our integrated business operations we sell electricity natural gas and other energy related products and sustainable solutions to various types of customers including distribution utilities municipalities cooperatives and commercial industrial governmental and residential customers in competitive markets across multiple geographic regions we have five reportable segments midatlantic midwest new york ercot and other power regions 

covid19 we have taken steps to mitigate the potential risks posed by the global outbreak pandemic of covid19 we provide a critical service to our customers which means that it is paramount that we keep our employees who operate our businesses safe and minimize unnecessary risk of exposure to the virus by taking extra precautions for employees who work in the field and in our facilities we have implemented work from home policies where appropriate and imposed travel limitations on employees 

we continue to implement strong physical and cybersecurity measures to ensure that our systems remain functional in order to both serve our operational needs with a remote workforce and keep them running to ensure uninterrupted service to our customers 

there were no changes in internal control over financial reporting as a result of covid19 that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting see item 9a controls and procedures for additional information 

unfavorable economic conditions due to covid19 resulted in an estimated reduction to our net income of approximately 170 million for the year ended december 31 2020 the impact was not material for the year ended december 31 2021 

we assessed longlived assets goodwill and investments for recoverability and there were no material impairment charges recorded in 2020 or 2021 as a result of covid19 see note 12 — asset impairments of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information related to other impairment assessments 

we will continue to monitor developments affecting our workforce customers and suppliers and will take additional precautions that we determine to be necessary in order to mitigate the impacts we cannot predict the full extent of the impacts of covid19 which will depend on among other things the rate and public perceptions of the effectiveness of vaccinations and rate of resumption of business activity 

significant 2021 transactions and developments 

separation from exelon 

on february 21 2021 exelon’s board of directors approved a plan to separate its competitive generation and customerfacing businesses into a standalone publicly traded company the separation exelon completed the separation on february 1 2022 in order to govern the ongoing relationships between us and exelon after the separation and to facilitate an orderly transition we and exelon have entered into several agreements including a separation agreement tax matters agreement a transition services agreement and an employee matters agreement and other ancillary agreements see note 24 — separation from exelon of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

in connection with the separation we incurred transaction costs of 49 million for the year ended december 31 2021 which are recorded in operating and maintenance expense we expect to incur incremental transaction costs of approximately 150 million and 60 million in 2022 and 2023 respectively the transaction costs are primarily comprised of systemrelated costs thirdparty costs paid to advisors consultants lawyers and other experts assisting in the separation 

ceng put option 

edf had the option to sell its 4999 equity interest in ceng to us exercisable beginning on january 1 2016 and thereafter until june 30 2022 on november 20 2019 we received notice of edf’s intention to exercise the put option and sell its 4999 equity interest in ceng to us and the put automatically exercised on january 19 2020 at the end of the sixtyday advance notice period on august 6 2021 we entered into a settlement agreement with edf pursuant to which we through a wholly owned subsidiary purchased edf’s equity interest in ceng for a net purchase price of 885 million which includes among other things a credit for edf’s share of the balance of the preferred distribution payable by ceng to us the difference between the net purchase price and edf’s noncontrolling interest as of the closing date was recorded to membership interest in the consolidated balance sheet 

in connection with the settlement agreement on august 6 2021 we issued approximately 880 million under a term loan credit agreement to fund the transaction which will expire on august 5 2022

clean energy law 

on september 15 2021 the illinois public act 1020662 was signed into law by the governor of illinois “clean energy law” the clean energy law is designed to achieve 100 carbonfree power by 2045 to enable the state’s transition to a clean energy economy the clean energy law establishes decarbonization requirements for illinois as well as programs to support the retention and development of emissionsfree sources of electricity among other things the clean energy law authorized the ipa to procure up to 545 million cmcs from qualifying nuclear plants for a fiveyear period beginning on june 1 2022 through may 31 2027 cmcs are credits for the carbonfree attributes of eligible nuclear power plants in pjm the byron dresden and braidwood nuclear plants located in illinois participated in the cmc procurement process and were awarded contracts that commit each plant to operate through may 31 2027 pursuant to these contracts comed will procure cmcs based upon the number of mwhs produced annually by each plant subject to minimum performance requirements see note 3 — regulatory matters of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

following enactment of the clean energy law we announced on september 15 2021 that we reversed our previous decision to retire byron and dresden given the opportunity for additional revenue in addition we no longer consider the braidwood or lasalle nuclear plants to be at risk for premature retirement see note 7  early plant retirements of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information and early retirement of generation facilities below 

early retirement of generation facilities 

in august 2020 we announced the intention to retire the byron generating station in september 2021 dresden generating station in november 2021 and mystic units 8 and 9 at the expiration of the cost of service commitment in may 2024 as a result we recognized a 500 million pretax impairment for the new england asset group along with certain onetime charges in the third and fourth quarters of 2020 in addition to ongoing annual financial impacts stemming from shortening the expected economic useful lives of these facilities primarily related to accelerated depreciation of plant assets including any arc and accelerated amortization of nuclear fuel 

in the second quarter of 2021 an incremental decline in value resulted in an additional pretax impairment charge of 350 million for the new england asset group 

we recorded pretax charges of 53 million and 140 million in the second and third quarters of 2021 respectively for decommissioningrelated activities that were not offset for the byron units due to the inability to recognize a regulatory asset at comed 

on september 15 2021 we reversed our previous decision to early retire byron and dresden and the expected economic useful life for both facilities was updated to 2044 and 2046 for byron units 1 and 2 respectively and to 2029 and 2031 for dresden units 2 and 3 respectively depreciation was therefore adjusted beginning september 15 2021 to reflect these extended useful life estimates in addition in the third quarter of 2021 we reversed approximately 81 million of severance benefit costs and 13 million of other onetime charges initially recorded in the third and fourth quarters of 2020 associated with the early retirements 

we recognized pretax expenses for byron dresden and mystic units 8 and 9 of 1458 million for the year ended december 31 2021 primarily due to accelerated depreciation and amortization of plant assets partially offset by the reversal of onetime charges for byron and dresden 

see note 7 — early plant retirements note 10 — asset retirement obligations and note 12 — asset impairments of the notes to consolidated financial statement for additional information 

impacts of february 2021 extreme cold weather event and texasbased generating assets outages 

beginning on february 15 2021 our texasbased generating assets within the ercot market specifically colorado bend ii wolf hollow ii and handley experienced outages as a result of extreme cold weather conditions in addition those weather conditions drove increased demand for service dramatically increased wholesale power prices and also increased gas prices in certain regions 

the estimated impact to our net income for the year ended december 31 2021 arising from these market and weather conditions was a reduction of approximately 800 million the ultimate impact to our consolidated financial statements may be affected by a number of factors including the impacts of customer and counterparty defaults and recoveries any additional solutions to address the financial challenges caused by the event and related litigation and contract disputes see note 3 — regulatory matters and note 19 — commitments and contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

to offset a portion of the unfavorable impacts we identified between 370 million and 450 million of enhanced revenue opportunities deferral of selected nonessential maintenance and primarily onetime cost savings which was achieved in 2021 

agreement for the sale of a biomass facility 

on april 28 2021 we entered into a purchase agreement with regenerate energy holdings llc regenerate under which regenerate agreed to purchase our interest in the albany green energy biomass facility as a result in the second quarter of 2021 we recorded a pretax impairment charge of 140 million the sale was completed on june 30 2021 for a net purchase price of 36 million see note 2 — mergers acquisitions and dispositions of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

agreement for sale of our solar business 

on december 8 2020 we entered into an agreement for the sale of a significant portion of our solar business including 360 megawatts of generation in operation or under construction at more than 600 sites across the united states completion of the sale occurred on march 31 2021 for a purchase price of 810 million see note 2 — mergers acquisitions and dispositions of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information

section 232 uranium petition 

on january 16 2018 two canadianowned uranium mining companies with operations in the us jointly submitted a petition to the us department of commerce doc seeking relief under section 232 of the trade expansion act of 1962 from imports of uranium products alleging that these imports threaten national security 

the united states nuclear fuel working group working group report was made public on april 23 2020 the working group report states that nuclear power is intrinsically tied to national security and promises that the us government will take bold actions to strengthen all parts of the nuclear fuel industry in the us it recommends the agreement suspending the antidumping investigation on uranium from the russian federation the “russian suspension agreement” or rsa be extended and to consider reducing the amount of russian imports of nuclear fuel the russian suspension agreement is the historical resolution of a 1991 doc investigation that found that the russians had been selling or “dumping” cheap uranium products into the us the rsa has been amended several times in the intervening years to allow russia to supply limited amounts of uranium products into the us it was set to expire at the end of 2020 but was amended on october 5 2020 to extend for another 20 years 

the working group report should be viewed as policy recommendations that may be implemented by executive agencies congress and or regulatory bodies we cannot predict the outcome of all of the policy changes recommended by the working group 

complaint at ferc seeking to alter capacity market default offer caps 

on february 21 2019 pjms independent market monitor imm filed a complaint alleging that the number of performance assessment intervals used to calculate the default offer cap for bids to supply capacity in pjm is too high resulting in an overstated default offer cap that obviates the need for most sellers to seek unitspecific approval of their offers the imm argued that this allows for the exercise of market power the imm asked ferc to require pjm to reduce the number of performance assessment intervals used to calculate the opportunity costs of a capacity supplier assuming a capacity obligation this would in turn lower the default offer cap and allow the imm to review more offers on a unitspecific basis several consumer advocates filed a complaint seeking similar relief several months after the imm’s complaint on march 18 2021 ferc granted the complaints finding the current estimate of performance assessment intervals to be excessive compared to the reasonably expected number of performance assessment intervals which results in an unjust and unreasonable default offer cap ferc did not establish the number of performance assessment intervals that should be used to calculate the default offer cap and instead requested briefs on the matter including alternative approaches to mitigation in the capacity market we submitted initial and reply briefs on may 3 2021 and june 9 2021 respectively and an answer to briefs filed by other parties on june 24 2021 on september 2 2021 ferc issued an order adopting the imms unitspecific avoidable cost offer review methodology and directed pjm to submit a compliance filing establishing new deadlines for offer review and related other activities leading up to the base residual auction for the 20232024 planning year and an additional compliance filing revising the pjm tariff to comply with fercs order we filed at ferc for rehearing on this matter on october 4 2021 which was deemed denied on november 4 2021 a number of parties including us have filed petitions for review of fercs orders in this proceeding which remain pending before the court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit we cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings or the financial statement impact 

hedging strategy 

we are exposed to commodity price risk associated with the unhedged portion of our electricity portfolio we enter into nonderivative and derivative contracts including options swaps and forward and futures contracts all with creditapproved counterparties to hedge this anticipated exposure for merchant revenues not already hedged via comprehensive state programs such as the cmc in illinois we utilize a threeyear ratable sales plan to align our hedging strategy with our financial objectives the prompt threeyear merchant revenues are hedged on an approximate rolling 906030 basis we may also enter into transactions that are outside of this ratable hedging program as of december 31 2021 the percentage of expected generation hedged for the midatlantic midwest new york and ercot reportable segments is 9295 and 7376 for 2022 and 2023 

respectively we have been and will continue to be proactive in using hedging strategies to mitigate commodity price risk 

we procure natural gas through longterm and shortterm contracts and spotmarket purchases nuclear fuel assemblies are obtained predominantly through longterm uranium concentrate supply contracts contracted conversion services contracted enrichment services or a combination thereof and contracted fuel fabrication services the supply markets for uranium concentrates and certain nuclear fuel services are subject to price fluctuations and availability restrictions approximately 50 of our uranium concentrate requirements from 2022 through 2026 are supplied by three suppliers in the event of nonperformance by these or other suppliers we believe that replacement uranium concentrate can be obtained although at prices that may be unfavorable when compared to the prices under the current supply agreements geopolitical developments have the potential to impact delivery from multiple suppliers in the international uranium industry nonperformance by these counterparties could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements 

see note 16 — derivative financial instruments of the notes to consolidated financial statements and item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect results of operations and the amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the financial statements management believes that the accounting policies described below require significant judgment in their application or incorporate estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods additional information on the application of these accounting policies can be found in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

nuclear decommissioning asset retirement obligations 

the aros associated with decommissioning our nuclear un its were 127 billion at december 31 2021 the authoritative guidance requires that we estimate our obligation for the future decommissioning of our nuclear generating plants to estimate that liability we use an internallydeveloped probabilityweighted discounted cash flow model which on a unitbyunit basis considers multiple decommissioning outcome scenarios 

as a result of nuclear plant retirements in the industry in recent years nuclear operators and thirdparty service providers are obtaining more information about costs associated with decommissioning activities at the same time regulators are gaining more information about decommissioning activities which could result in changes to existing decommissioning requirements in addition as more nuclear plants are retired it is possible that technological advances will be identified that could create efficiencies and lead to a reduction in decommissioning costs the amount of ndt funds could also impact the timing of the decommissioning activities additionally certain factors such as changes in regulatory requirements during plant operations or the profitability of a nuclear plant could impact the timing of plant retirements these factors could result in material changes to our current estimates as more information becomes available and could change the timing of plant retirements and the probability assigned to the decommissioning outcome scenarios 

the nuclear decommissioning obligation is adjusted on a regular basis due to the passage of time and revisions to the key assumptions for the expected timing andor estimated amounts of the future undiscounted cash flows required to decommission the nuclear plants based upon the following methodologies and significant estimates and assumptions 

decommissioning cost studies we use unitbyunit decommissioning cost studies to provide a marketplace assessment of the expected costs in current year dollars and timing of decommissioning activities which are validated by comparison to current decommissioning projects within the industry and other estimates decommissioning cost studies are updated on a rotational basis for each of our nuclear units at least every five years unless circumstances warrant more frequent updates as part of the annual cost study update process we evaluate newly assumed costs or substantive changes in previously assumed costs to determine if the cost estimate impacts are sufficiently material to warrant application of the updated estimates to the aros across the nuclear fleet outside of the normal fiveyear rotating cost study update cycle 

cost escalation factors we use cost escalation factors to escalate the decommissioning costs from the decommissioning cost studies discussed above through the assumed decommissioning period for each of the units cost escalation studies updated on an annual basis are used to determine escalation factors and are based on inflation indices for labor equipment and materials energy llrw disposal and other costs all the nuclear aros are adjusted each year for updated cost escalation factors 

probabilistic cash flow models our probabilistic cash flow models include the assignment of probabilities to various scenarios for decommissioning cost levels decommissioning approaches and timing of plant shutdown on a unitbyunit basis probabilities assigned to cost levels include an assessment of the likelihood of costs 20 higher highcost scenario or 15 lower lowcost scenario than the base cost scenario the assumed decommissioning scenarios generally include the following three alternatives 1 decon which assumes major decommissioning activities begin shortly after the cessation of operation 2 shortened safstor which generally assumes a 30year delay prior to onset of major decommissioning activities and 3 safstor which assumes the nuclear facility is placed and maintained in such condition during decommissioning so that the nuclear facility can be safely stored and subsequently decontaminated within 60 years after cessation of operations in each decommissioning scenario spent fuel is transferred to dry cask storage as soon as possible until doe acceptance for disposal 

the actual decommissioning approach selected once a nuclear facility is shutdown will be determined at the time of shutdown and may be influenced by multiple factors including the funding status of the ndt funds at the time of shutdown and regulatory or other commitments 

the assumed plant shutdown timing scenarios include the following four alternatives 1 the probability of operating through the original 40year nuclear license term 2 the probability of operating through an initial 20year license renewal term 3 the probability of a second 20year license renewal term and 4 the probability of early plant retirement for certain sites due to changing market conditions and regulatory environments as power market and regulatory environment developments occur we evaluate and incorporate as necessary the impacts of such developments into our nuclear aro assumptions and estimates 

our probabilistic cash flow models also include an assessment of the timing of doe acceptance of snf for disposal we currently assume doe will begin accepting snf from the industry in 2035 the snf acceptance date assumption is based on management’s estimates of the amount of time required for doe to select a site location and develop the necessary infrastructure for longterm snf storage for additional information regarding snf see note 19 — commitments and contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

discount rates the probabilityweighted estimated future cash flows for the various assumed scenarios are discounted using creditadjusted riskfree rates carfr applicable to the various businesses in which each of the nuclear units originally operated we initially recognize an aro at fair value and subsequently adjust it for changes to estimated costs timing of future cash flows and modifications to decommissioning assumptions the aro is not required or permitted to be remeasured for changes in the carfr that occur in isolation increases in the aro due to upward revisions in estimated undiscounted cash flows are considered new obligations and are measured using a current carfr as the increase creates a new cost layer within the aro any decrease in the estimated undiscounted future cash flows relating to the aro are treated as a modification of an existing aro cost layer and therefore are measured using the average historical carfr rates used in creating the initial aro cost layers if all our future nominal cash flows associated with the aro were to be discounted at the current prevailing carfr the obligation would increase from approximately 127 billion to approximately 160 billion 

the following table illustrates the significant impact that changes in the carfr when combined with changes in projected amounts and expected timing of cash flows can have on the valuation of the aro 



aro sensitivities changes in the assumptions underlying the aro could materially affect the decommissioning obligation the impact of a change in any one of these assumptions to the aro is highly dependent on how the other assumptions may correspondingly change 

the following table illustrates the effects of changing certain aro assumptions while holding all other assumptions constant 



 

a excludes any sites in which management has committed to a specific decommissioning approach 

b excludes any retired sites

unamortized energy contract assets and liabilities 

unamortized energy contract assets and liabilities represent the remaining unamortized balances of nonderivative energy contracts that we have acquired the initial amount recorded represents the difference between the fair value of the contracts at the time of acquisition and the contract value based on the terms of each contract the unamortized energy contract assets and liabilities are amortized over the life of the contract in relation to the expected realization of the underlying cash flows amortization of the unamortized energy contract assets and liabilities are recorded through operating revenues or purchased power and fuel expense depending on the nature of the underlying contract see note 13 — intangible assets of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

impairment of longlived assets 

we regularly monitor and evaluate the carrying value of longlived assets or asset groups for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable indicators of potential impairment may include a deteriorating business climate including but not limited to declines in energy prices condition of the asset or plans to dispose of a longlived asset significantly before the end of its useful life 

the review of longlived assets or asset groups for impairment utilizes significant assumptions about operating strategies and estimates of future cash flows which require assessments of current and projected market conditions forecasting future cash flows requires assumptions regarding forecasted commodity prices for the sale of power and purchases of fuel and the expected operations of assets a variation in the assumptions used could lead to a different conclusion regarding the recoverability of an asset or asset group and thus could potentially result in material future impairments an impairment evaluation is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level at which cash flows of the longlived assets or asset groups are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities the lowest level of independent cash flows is determined by the evaluation of several factors including the geographic dispatch of the generation units and the hedging strategies related to those units the cash flows from our generating units are generally evaluated at a regional portfolio level given the interdependency of cash flows generated from the customer supply and risk management activities within each region in certain cases our generating assets may be evaluated on an individual basis where those assets are contracted on a longterm basis with a thirdparty and operations are independent of other generating assets typically contracted renewables 

on a quarterly basis we assess our longlived assets or asset groups for indicators of potential impairment if indicators are present for a longlived asset or asset group a comparison of the undiscounted expected future cash flows to the carrying value is performed when the undiscounted cash flow analysis indicates the carrying value of a longlived asset or asset group may not be recoverable the amount of the impairment loss is determined by measuring the excess of the carrying amount of the longlived asset or asset group over its fair value the fair value of the longlived asset or asset group is dependent upon a market participant’s view of the exit price of the asset or asset groups this includes significant assumptions of the estimated future cash flows generated by the asset or asset groups and market discount rates events and circumstances often do not occur as expected resulting in differences between prospective financial information and actual results which may be material the determination of fair value is driven by both internal assumptions that include significant unobservable inputs level 3 such as revenue and generation forecasts projected capital maintenance expenditures and discount rates as well as information from various public financial and industry sources 

see note 12 — asset impairments of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of asset impairment assessments 

depreciable lives of property plant and equipment 

we have significant investments in electric generation assets these assets are generally depreciated on a straightline basis using the group composite or unitary methods of depreciation the group approach is typically for groups of similar assets that have approximately the same useful lives and the composite approach is used for heterogeneous assets that have different lives under both methods a reporting entity depreciates the assets over the average life of the assets in the group the estimation of asset useful lives requires management judgment supported by formal depreciation studies of historical asset retirement experience depreciation studies are generally conducted periodically if an event regulatory action or change in retirement patterns indicate an update is necessary 

along with depreciation study results management considers expected future energy market conditions and generation plant operating costs and capital investment requirements in determining the estimated service lives of our generating facilities and reassesses the reasonableness of estimated useful lives whenever events or changes in circumstances warrant when a determination has been made that an asset will be retired before the end of its current estimated useful life depreciation provisions will be accelerated to reflect the shortened estimated useful life which could have a material unfavorable impact on future results of operations see note 7 — early plant retirements of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

changes in estimated useful lives of electric generation assets could have a significant impact on future results of operations see note 1 — significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding depreciation and estimated service lives of the property plant and equipment 

accounting for derivative instruments 

we use derivative instruments to manage commodity price risk foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk related to ongoing business operations our derivative activities are in accordance with our risk management policy rmp see note 16 — derivative financial instruments of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

we account for derivative financial instruments under the applicable authoritative guidance determining whether a contract qualifies as a derivative requires that management exercise significant judgment including assessing market liquidity as well as determining whether a contract has one or more underlying and one or more notional quantities changes in management’s assessment of contracts and the liquidity of their markets and changes in authoritative guidance could result in previously excluded contracts becoming in scope of new authoritative guidance 

all derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value except for certain derivatives that qualify for and are elected under npns derivatives entered for economic hedging and for proprietary trading purposes are recorded at fair value through earnings 

npns as part of our energy marketing business we enter contracts to buy and sell energy to meet the requirements of our customers these contracts include shortterm and longterm commitments to purchase and 

sell energy and energyrelated products in the retail and wholesale markets with the intent and ability to deliver or take delivery while some of these contracts are considered derivative financial instruments under the authoritative guidance certain of these qualifying transactions have been designated as npns transactions and are not required to be recorded at fair value but rather on an accrual basis of accounting determining whether a contract qualifies for the npns requires judgment on whether the contract will physically deliver and requires that management ensure compliance with all associated qualification and documentation requirements revenues and expenses on contracts that qualify as npns are recognized when the underlying physical transaction is completed contracts that qualify for npns are those for which physical delivery is probable quantities are expected to be used or sold in the normal course of business over a reasonable period and the contract is not financially settled on a net basis 

commodity contracts identification of a commodity contract as an economic hedge requires us to determine that the contract is in accordance with the rmp we reassess our economic hedges on a regular basis to determine if they continue to be within the guidelines of the rmp 

as a part of the authoritative guidance we make estimates and assumptions concerning future commodity prices load requirements interest rates the timing of future transactions and their probable cash flows the fair value of contracts and the expected changes in the fair value in deciding whether to enter derivative transactions and in determining the initial accounting treatment for derivative transactions under the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements we categorize these derivatives under a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value 

derivative contracts are traded in both exchangebased and nonexchangebased markets exchangebased derivatives that are valued using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets are generally categorized in level 1 in the fair value hierarchy 

certain derivative pricing is verified using indicative price quotations available through brokers or overthecounter online exchanges the price quotations reflect the average of the midpoint of the bidask spread from observable markets that we believe provide the most liquid market for the commodity the price quotations are reviewed and corroborated to ensure the prices are observable and representative of an orderly transaction between market participants our derivatives are traded predominantly at liquid trading points the remaining derivative contracts are valued using models that consider inputs such as contract terms including maturity and market parameters and assumptions of the future prices of energy interest rates volatility credit worthiness and credit spread for derivatives that trade in liquid markets such as generic forwards swaps and options the model inputs are generally observable such instruments are categorized in level 2 

for derivatives that trade in less liquid markets with limited pricing information the model inputs generally would include both observable and unobservable inputs and are categorized in level 3 

we consider nonperformance risk including credit risk in the valuation of derivative contracts and both historical and current market data in our assessment of nonperformance risk the impacts of nonperformance and credit risk to date have generally not been material to the financial statements 

see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and note 18 — fair value of financial assets and liabilities and note 16 — derivative financial instruments of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding derivative instruments 

taxation 

significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes primarily due to the uncertainty related to tax positions taken as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities and valuation allowances we account for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with a twostep approach including a morelikelythannot recognition threshold and a measurement approach based on the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement management evaluates each position based solely on the technical merits and facts and circumstances of the position assuming the position will be examined by a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information significant judgment is required to determine whether the recognition threshold has been met and if so the appropriate amount of tax benefits to be recorded in the consolidated financial statements 

we evaluate quarterly the probability of realizing deferred tax assets by reviewing a forecast of future taxable income and our intent and ability to implement tax planning strategies if necessary to realize deferred tax assets we also assess negative evidence such as the expiration of historical operating loss or tax credit carryforwards that could indicate our inability to realize our deferred tax assets based on the combined assessment we record valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when it is morelikelythannot such benefit will not be realized in future periods 

actual income taxes could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items including future changes in income tax laws our forecasted financial condition and results of operations failure to successfully implement tax planning strategies as well as results of audits and examinations of filed tax returns by taxing authorities see note 14 — income taxes of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

accounting for loss contingencies 

in the preparation of our financial statements we make judgments regarding the future outcome of contingent events and record liabilities for loss contingencies that are probable and can be reasonably estimated based upon available information the amount recorded may differ from the actual expense incurred when the uncertainty is resolved such difference could have a significant impact in the consolidated financial statements 

environmental costs environmental investigation and remediation liabilities are based upon estimates with respect to the number of sites for which we will be responsible the scope and cost of work to be performed at each site the portion of costs that will be shared with other parties the timing of the remediation work regulations and the requirements of local governmental authorities in addition periodic reviews are performed to assess the adequacy of other environmental reserves these matters if resolved in a manner different from the estimate could have a significant impact in the consolidated financial statements see note 19 — commitments and contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

other including personal injury claims prior to our separation from exelon we were selfinsured for general liability automotive liability and workers’ compensation claims upon separation we now maintain insurance coverage for general liability automotive liability and workers’ compensation and are selfinsured to the extent that losses are within policy deductibles or exceed the amount of insurance maintained for personal injury claims we are selfinsured to the extent that losses are within policy deductibles or exceed the amount of insurance maintained we have reserves for both open claims asserted and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported ibnr the ibnr reserve is estimated based on actuarial assumptions and analysis and is updated annually future events such as the number of new claims to be filed each year the average cost of disposing of claims as well as the numerous uncertainties surrounding litigation and possible state and national legislative measures could cause the actual costs to be higher or lower than estimated accordingly these claims if resolved in a manner different from the estimate could have a material impact to the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

sources of revenue and determination of accounting treatment we earn revenue from various business activities including the sale of power and energyrelated products such as natural gas capacity and other commodities in nonregulated markets wholesale and retail and the provision of other energyrelated nonregulated products and services 

the accounting treatment for revenue recognition is based on the nature of the underlying transaction and applicable authoritative guidance we primarily apply the revenue from contracts with customers and derivatives revenues guidance to recognize revenue as discussed in more detail below 

revenue from contracts with customers we recognize revenues in the period in which the performance obligations within contracts with customers are satisfied which generally occurs when power natural gas and other energyrelated commodities and services are provided to the customer transactions within the scope of revenue from contracts with customers generally include nonderivative agreements contracts that are designated as npns and spotmarket energy commodity sales including settlements with isos 

the determination of our retail power and natural gas sales to individual customers is based on systematic readings of customer meters generally monthly energy delivered to customers that has not yet been billed as of the reporting period is estimated and corresponding unbilled revenue is recorded the measurement of unbilled revenue is based upon individual customer meter readings forecasted volumes and applicable rates see note 1 — significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

derivative revenues we record revenues and expenses using the marktomarket method of accounting for transactions that are accounted for as derivatives these derivative transactions primarily relate to commodity price risk management activities marktomarket revenues and expenses include inception gains or losses on new transactions where the fair value is observable unrealized gains and losses from changes in the fair value of open contracts and realized gains and losses 

results of operations 

for discussion of the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the year ended december 31 2019 refer to managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the form 10 



year ended december 31 2021 compared to year ended december 31 2020 net income attributable to membership inte res t decreased by 794 million primarily due to 

• impacts of the february 2021 extreme cold weather event 

• accelerated depreciation and amortization associated with our previous decision in the third quarter of 2020 to early retire byron and dresden nuclear facilities in 2021 a decision which was reversed 

on september 15 2021 and our decision in the third quarter of 2020 to early retire mystic units 8 and 9 in 2024 

• decommissioningrelated activities that were not offset for the byron units beginning in the second quarter of 2021 through september 15 2021 with our september 15 2021 reversal of the previous decision to retire byron we resumed contractual offset for byron as of that date 

• impairments of the new england asset group the albany green energy biomass facility and a wind project partially offset by the absence of an impairment of the new england asset group in the third quarter of 2020 

• higher net unrealized and realized losses on equity investments and 

• the absence of prior year onetime tax settlements 

the decreases were partially offset by 

• higher marktomarket gains 

• higher net unrealized and realized gains on ndt funds 

• absence of one time charges recorded in 2020 associated with our decision to early retire the byron and dresden nuclear facilities and mystic units 8 and 9 and the reversal of onetime charges resulting from the reversal of the previous decision to early retire byron and dresden on september 15 2021 

• favorable sales and hedges of excess emission credits 

• favorable commodity prices on fuel hedges 

• lower nuclear fuel costs due to accelerated amortization of nuclear fuel and lower prices and 

• higher new york zec revenues due to higher generation and an increase in zec prices 

operating revenues the basis for our reportable segments is the integrated management of our electricity business that is located in different geographic regions and largely representative of the footprints of isorto andor nerc regions which utilize multiple supply sources to provide electricity through various distribution channels wholesale and retail our hedging strategies and risk metrics are also aligned with these same geographic regions our five reportable segments are midatlantic midwest new york ercot and other power regions see note 5 — segment information of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on these reportable segments 

the following business activities are not allocated to a region and are reported under other natural gas as well as other miscellaneous business activities that are not significant to overall operating revenues or results of operations 

for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to 2020 operating revenues by region were as follows 

  

a  change in marktomarket is not a meaningful measure 

sales and supply sources our sales and supply sources by region are summarized below 



 

a includes the proportionate share of output where we have an undivided ownership interest in jointlyowned generating plants includes the total output for fully owned plants and the total output for ceng prior to the acquisition of edf’s 

interest on august 6 2021 as ceng was fully consolidated see note 2 — mergers acquisitions and dispositions of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on our acquisition of edf’s interest in ceng 

nuclear fleet capacity factor the following table presents nuclear fleet operating data for our plants which reflects ownership percentage of stations operated by us excluding salem which is operated by pseg the nuclear fleet capacity factor presented in the table is defined as the ratio of the actual output of a plant over a period of time to its output if the plant had operated at full average annual mean capacity for that time period we consider capacity factor to be a useful measure to analyze the nuclear fleet performance between periods we have included the analysis below as a complement to the financial information provided in accordance with gaap however these measures are not a presentation defined under gaap and may not be comparable to other companies’ presentations or be more useful than the gaap information provided elsewhere in this report 



zec prices we are compensated through state programs for the carbonfree attributes of our nuclear generation zec prices have a significant impact on operating revenues the following table presents the average zec prices mwh for each of our major regions in which state programs have been enacted prices reflect the weighted average price for the various delivery periods within each calendar year 



 

a see note 7 — early plant retirements of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the plants receiving payments through state programs 

capacity prices we participate in capacity auctions in each of our major regions except ercot which does not have a capacity market we also incur capacity costs associated with load served except in ercot capacity prices have a significant impact on our operating revenues and purchased power and fuel the following table presents the average capacity prices mw day for each of our major regions prices reflect the weighted average price for the various auction periods within each calendar year 



electricity prices the price of electricity has a significant impact on our operating revenues and purchased power cost the following table presents the average dayahead aroundtheclock price mwh for each of our major regions 



 

a reflects new england which comprises the majority of the activity in the other region 

for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to 2020 changes in operating revenues by region were approximately as follows

the following business activities are not allocated to a region and are reported under other natural gas as well as other miscellaneous business activities that are not significant to overall purchased power and fuel expense or results of operations and accelerated nuclear fuel amortization associated with nuclear decommissioning 

for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to 2020 purchased power and fuel by region were as follows 



 

a  change in marktomarket is not a meaningful measure 

for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to 2020 changes in purchased power and fuel by region were approximately as follows 

  

a  change in marktomarket is not a meaningful measure 

b see note 16 — derivative financial instruments of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on marktomarket gains and losses 

the changes in operating and maintenance expense consisted of the following 



 

a primarily reflects contractual offset of accelerated depreciation and amortization associated with our previous decision to early retire the byron and dresden nuclear facilities see note 10 — asset retirement obligations of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

depreciation and amortization expense increased for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 primarily due to the accelerated depreciation and amortization associated with our previous decision to early retire the byron and dresden nuclear facilities this decision was reversed on september 15 2021 and depreciation for byron and dresden was adjusted beginning september 15 2021 to reflect the extended useful life estimates a portion of this accelerated depreciation and amortization is offset in operating and maintenance expense 

gain on sales of assets and businesses increased for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 primarily due to gains on sales of equity investments that became publicly traded entities in the fourth quarter of 2020 and the first half of 2021 and a gain on sale of our solar business 

inte res t expense net decreased for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 primarily due to decreased expense related to the cr nonrecourse senior secured term loan credit facility and interest rate swaps and decreases in interest rates see note 17 — debt and credit agreements of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the cr credit facility and interest rate swaps 

other net decreased for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 due to activity described in the table below 



   

a unrealized gains realized gains and interest and dividend income on the ndt funds are associated with the nonregulatory agreement units in addition also includes unrealized gains realized gains and interest and dividend income on the ndt funds associated with the byron units as decommissioningrelated impacts were not offset starting in the second quarter of 2021 due to the inability to recognize a regulatory asset at comed with the september 15 2021 reversal of the previous decision to retire byron we resumed contractual offset for byron as of that date see note 10 — asset retirement obligations of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

b contractual elimination of income tax expense is associated with the income taxes on the ndt funds of the regulatory agreement units 

c net unrealized gains and losses from equity investments that became publicly traded entities in the fourth quarter of 2020 and the first half of 2021 

effective income tax rates were 1480 and 298 for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively the higher effective tax rate in 2021 is primarily due to the impacts of the february 2021 extreme cold weather event on income before income taxes s ee note 14 — income taxes of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 primarily due to cengs results of operations prior to our acquisition of edfs interest in ceng on august 6 2021 

liquidity and capital resources 

for discussion of the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the year ended december 31 2019 refer to liquidity and capital resources of managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the form 10 

all results included throughout the liquidity and capital resources section are presented on a gaap basis 

our operating and capital expenditures requirements are provided by internally generated cash flows from operations the sale of certain receivables as well as funds from external sources in the capital markets and through bank borrowings our business is capital intensive and requires considerable capital resources we annually evaluate our financing plan and credit line sizing focusing on maintaining our investment grade ratings while meeting our cash needs to fund capital requirements including construction expenditures retire debt pay dividends fund pension and opeb obligations and invest in new and existing ventures a broad spectrum of financing alternatives beyond the core financing options can be used to meet our needs and fund growth including monetizing assets in the portfolio via project financing asset sales and the use of other financing structures eg joint ventures minority partners etc our access to external financing on reasonable terms depends on our credit ratings and current overall capital market business conditions if these conditions deteriorate to the extent that we no longer have access to the capital markets at reasonable terms we have access to credit facilities with aggregate bank commitments of 57 billion we utilize our credit facilities to support our commercial paper programs provide for other shortterm borrowings and to issue letters of credit see the “credit matters” section below for additional information we expect cash flows to be sufficient to meet operating expenses financing costs and capital expenditure requirements see note 17 — debt and credit agreements of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on our debt and credit agreements 

pursuant to the separation agreement between us and exelon we received a cash payment of 175 billion from exelon on january 31 2022 see note 24 — separation from exelon of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the separation 

nrc minimum funding requirements 

nrc regulations require that licensees of nuclear generating facilities demonstrate reasonable assurance that sufficient funds will be available in certain minimum amounts to decommission the facility these nrc minimum funding levels are typically based upon the assumption that decommissioning activities will commence after the end of the current licensed life of each unit if a unit fails the nrc minimum funding test then the plant’s owners or parent companies would be required to take steps such as providing financial guarantees through surety bonds letters of credit or parent company guarantees or making additional cash contributions to the ndt fund to 

ensure sufficient funds are available see note 10  asset retirement obligations of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

if a nuclear plant were to early retire there is a risk that it will no longer meet the nrc minimum funding requirements due to the earlier commencement of decommissioning activities and a shorter time period over which the ndt funds could appreciate in value a shortfall could require that we address the shortfall by providing additional financial assurances such as surety bonds letters of credit or parent company guarantees for our share of the funding assurance however the amount of any assurance will ultimately depend on the decommissioning approach the associated level of costs and the ndt fund investment performance going forward no later than two years after shutting down a plant we must submit a psdar to the nrc that includes the planned option for decommissioning the site 

upon issuance of any required financial assurances subject to satisfying various regulatory preconditions each site would be able to utilize the respective ndt funds for radiological decommissioning costs which represent the majority of the total expected decommissioning costs however under the regulations the nrc must approve an exemption in order for us to utilize the ndt funds to pay for nonradiological decommissioning costs ie spent fuel management and site restoration costs if applicable any amounts not covered by an exemption would be borne by us without reimbursement 

as of december 31 2021 we are not required to provide any additional financial assurance for tmi unit 1 under the safstor scenario that is the planned decommissioning option as described in the tmi unit 1 psdar filed with the nrc on april 5 2019 on october 16 2019 the nrc granted our exemption request to use the tmi unit 1 ndt funds for spent fuel management costs an additional exemption request to allow the tmi unit 1 ndt funds to be used for site restoration costs was submitted to the nrc on may 20 2021 and is pending nrc review 

cash flows from operating activities 

our cash flows from operating activities primarily result from the sale of electric energy and energyrelated products and services to customers our future cash flows from operating activities may be affected by future demand for and market prices of energy and our ability to continue to produce and supply power at competitive costs as well as to obtain collections from customers and the sale of certain receivables 

see note 3 — regulatory matters and note 19 — commitments and contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on regulatory and legal proceedings and proposed legislation 

the following table provides a summary of the change in cash flows from operating activities for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 



changes in our cash flows from operations were generally consistent with changes in results of operations as adjusted by changes in working capital in the normal course of business except as discussed below in addition significant operating cash flow impacts for 2021 and 2020 were as follows 

• see note 22 —supplemental financial information of the notes to consolidated financial statements and the consolidated statement of cash flows for additional information on noncash operating activities  

• option premiums paid relate to options contracts that we purchase and sell as part of our established policies and procedures to manage risks associated with market fluctuations in commodity prices see note 16 — derivative financial instruments of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on derivative contracts

• see note 6 — accounts receivable of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the collection of dpp  

• proceeds from sales of assets and businesses increased primarily due to the sale of a significant portion of our solar business and a biomass facility and proceeds received on sales of equity investments see note 2 — mergers acquisitions and dispositions of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the sale of our solar business and biomass facility 

cash flows from financing activities

• longterm debt net varies due to debt issuances and redemptions each year refer to debt issuances and redemptions tables below for additional information 

• changes in money pool with exelon are driven by shortterm borrowing needs exelon operated a money pool for its subsidiaries that provided an additional shortterm borrowing option that was generally more favorable to the borrowing participants than the cost of external financing 

• see note 2 — mergers acquisitions and dispositions of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the acquisition of ceng noncontrolling interest 

• other financing activities primarily consists of debt issuance costs see debt issuances table below for additional information on debt issuances

credit matters and cash requirements 

we fund liquidity needs for capital expenditures working capital energy hedging and other financial commitments through cash flows from continuing operations public debt offerings commercial paper markets and large diversified credit facilities as of december 31 2021 our credit facilities included 66 billion in aggregate total commitments of which 34 billion was available to support additional commercial paper and of which no financial institution has more than 8 of the aggregate commitments in connection with our separation from exelon we entered into two new credit agreements that replaced our syndicated revolving credit facility under the new agreements we have access to credit facilities with aggregate bank commitments of 57 billion we had access to the commercial paper markets and had availability under our revolving credit facilities during 2021 to fund our shortterm liquidity needs when necessary we used our available credit facilities to manage shortterm liquidity needs as a result of the impacts of the february 2021 extreme cold weather event we routinely review the sufficiency of our liquidity position including appropriate sizing of credit facility commitments by performing various stress test scenarios such as commodity price movements increases in marginrelated transactions changes in hedging levels and the impacts of hypothetical credit downgrades we closely monitor events in the financial markets and the financial institutions associated with the credit facilities including monitoring credit ratings and outlooks credit default swap levels capital raising and merger activity see part i item 1a risk factors for additional information regarding the effects of uncertainty in the capital and credit markets 

we believe our cash flow from operating activities access to credit markets and our credit facilities provide sufficient liquidity to support the estimated future cash requirements discussed below 

if we lost our investment grade credit rating as of december 31 2021 we would have been required to provide incremental collateral of approximately 21 billion to meet collateral obligations for derivatives nonderivatives npns and applicable payables and receivables net of the contractual right of offset under master netting agreements which was well within the 34 billion of available credit capacity of our revolver as of december 31 2021 see note 16 — derivative financial instruments and note 17 — debt and credit agreements of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

capital expenditures 

our most recent estimate of capital expenditures for plant additions and improvements is approximately 17 billion for 2022 and approximately 29 billion for the period from 2023 to 2024 projected capital expenditures and other investments are subject to periodic review and revision to reflect changes in economic conditions and other factors 

approximately 50 of projected capital expenditures are for the acquisition of nuclear fuel with the remaining amounts primarily reflecting additions and upgrades to existing generation facilities including material condition improvements during nuclear refueling outages

project financing 

project financing is based upon a nonrecourse financial structure in which project debt is paid back from the cash generated by a specific asset or portfolio of assets borrowings under these agreements are secured by the assets and equity of each respective project lenders do not have recourse against us in the event of a default if a project financing entity does not maintain compliance with its specific debt covenants there could be a requirement to accelerate repayment of the associated debt or other projectrelated borrowings earlier than the stated maturity dates in these instances if such repayment were not satisfied or restructured the lenders or security holders would generally have rights to foreclose against the projectspecific assets and related collateral the potential requirement to repay the debt or other borrowings earlier than otherwise anticipated could lead to impairments due to a higher likelihood of disposing of the respective projectspecific assets significantly before the end of their useful lives see note 17 — debt and credit agreements of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on project finance credit facilities and nonrecourse debt 

credit facilities 

we meet our shortterm liquidity requirements primarily through the issuance of commercial paper we may use our credit facilities for general corporate purposes including meeting shortterm funding requirements and the issuance of letters of credit see note 17 — debt and credit agreements of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on our credit facilities 

capital structure 

at december 31 2021 our capital structure consisted of the following 



security ratings 

our access to the capital markets including the commercial paper market and our financing costs in those markets may depend on our securities ratings 

our borrowings are not subject to default or prepayment as a result of a downgrade of our securities although such a downgrade could increase fees and interest charges under our credit agreements 

as part of the normal course of business we enter into contracts that contain express provisions or otherwise permit us and our counterparties to demand adequate assurance of future performance when there are reasonable grounds for doing so in accordance with the contracts and applicable contracts law if we are downgraded by a credit rating agency it is possible that a counterparty would attempt to rely on such a downgrade as a basis for making a demand for adequate assurance of future performance which could include the posting of additional collateral see note 16 — derivative financial instruments of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on collateral provisions 

on february 24 2021 sp lowered our senior unsecured debt rating to bbb from bbb in response to the financial impacts of the february 2021 weather event and outages at our texasbased generating assets see note 3 — regulatory matters of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information the sp rating change did not materially impact our financial statements furthermore there were no material increases in required collateral or financial assurances or material impacts to our anticipated access to liquidity or cost of financing at separation sp and moodys affirmed the senior unsecured ratings of bbb and baa2 respectively fitch also affirmed their final rating of bbb prior to formally withdrawing coverage on january 5th we will only be engaging sp and moodys for ratings coverage following separation

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend

we are exposed to market risks associated with adverse changes in commodity prices counterparty credit interest rates and equity prices we manage these risks through risk management policies and objectives for risk assessment control and valuation counterparty credit approval and the monitoring and reporting of risk exposures historically reporting on risk management issues has been to exelon’s risk management committee and the risk committee of exelon’s board of directors after separation reporting on risk management issues will be to the executive committee the risk management committees of our generation and customerfacing businesses and the audit and risk committee of the board of directors 

commodity price risk 

commodity price risk is associated with price movements resulting from changes in supply and demand fuel costs market liquidity weather conditions governmental regulatory and environmental policies and other factors to the extent the total amount of energy we generate and purchase differs from the amount of energy we 

have contracted to sell we are exposed to market fluctuations in commodity prices we seek to mitigate our commodity price risk through the sale and purchase of electricity fossil fuel and other commodities 

electricity available from our owned or contracted generation supply in excess of our obligations to customers is sold into the wholesale markets to reduce commodity price risk caused by market fluctuations we enter into nonderivative contracts as well as derivative contracts including swaps futures forwards and options with approved counterparties to hedge anticipated exposures we use derivative instruments as economic hedges to mitigate exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices we expect the settlement of the majority of our economic hedges will occur during 2022 through 2024 

in general increases and decreases in forward market prices have a positive and negative impact respectively on our owned and contracted generation positions which have not been hedged for merchant revenues not already hedged via comprehensive state programs such as the cmc in illinois we utilize a threeyear ratable sales plan to align our hedging strategy with our financial objectives the prompt threeyear merchant revenues are hedged on an approximate rolling 906030 basis we may also enter transactions that are outside of this ratable hedging program as of december 31 2021 the percentage of expected generation hedged for the midatlantic midwest new york and ercot reportable segments is 9295 and 7376 for 2022 and 2023 respectively the percentage of expected generation hedged is the amount of equivalent sales divided by the expected generation expected generation is the volume of energy that best represents our commodity position in energy markets from owned or contracted generation based upon a simulated dispatch model that makes assumptions regarding future market conditions which are calibrated to market quotes for power fuel load following products and options equivalent sales represent all hedging products which include economic hedges cmc payments and certain nonderivative contracts 

a portion of our hedging strategy may be accomplished with fuel products based on assumed correlations between power and fuel prices which routinely change in the market market price risk exposure is the risk of a change in the value of unhedged positions the forecasted market price risk exposure for our entire economic hedge portfolio associated with a 5mwh reduction in the annual average aroundtheclock energy price based on december 31 2021 market conditions and hedged position would be a decrease in pretax net income of approximately 20 million and 243 million for 2022 and 2023 respectively power price sensitivities are derived by adjusting power price assumptions while keeping all other price inputs constant we actively manage our portfolio to mitigate market price risk exposure for our unhedged position actual results could differ depending on the specific timing of and markets affected by price changes as well as future changes in our portfolio see note 16 — derivative financial instruments of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

fuel procurement 

we procure natural gas through longterm and shortterm contracts and spotmarket purchases nuclear fuel assemblies are obtained predominantly through longterm uranium concentrate supply contracts contracted conversion services contracted enrichment services or a combination thereof and contracted fuel fabrication services the supply markets for uranium concentrates and certain nuclear fuel services are subject to price fluctuations and availability restrictions supply market conditions may make our procurement contracts subject to credit risk related to the potential nonperformance of counterparties to deliver the contracted commodity or service at the contracted prices approximately 50 of our uranium concentrate requirements from 2022 through 2026 are supplied by three suppliers in the event of nonperformance by these or other suppliers we believe that replacement uranium concentrates can be obtained although at prices that may be unfavorable when compared to the prices under the current supply agreements geopolitical developments including the russian ukraine conflict and united states sanctions against russia have the potential to impact delivery from multiple suppliers in the international uranium industry nonperformance by these counterparties could have a material adverse impact in our financial statements 

trading and nontrading marketing activities 

the following table detailing our trading and nontrading marketing activities is included to address the recommended disclosures by the energy industry’s committee of chief risk officers ccro 

the following table provides detail on changes in our commodity marktomarket net asset or liability balance sheet position from december 31 2019 to december 31 2021 it indicates the drivers behind changes in the balance sheet amounts this table incorporates the marktomarket activities that are immediately recorded in earnings this table excludes all npns contracts and does not segregate proprietary trading activity see note 16 — derivative financial instruments of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the balance sheet classification of the marktomarket energy contract net assets liabilities recorded as of december 31 2021 and 2020

b amounts are shown net of collateral paidreceived from counterparties and offset against marktomarket assets and liabilities of 512 million at december 31 2021 

credit risk 

we would be exposed to creditrelated losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties that execute derivative instruments the credit exposure of derivative contracts before collateral is represented by the fair value of contracts at the reporting date see note 16 — derivative financial instruments of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of credit risk 

the following tables provide information on our credit exposure for all derivative instruments npns and payables and receivables net of collateral and instruments that are subject to master netting agreements as of december 31 2021 the tables further delineate that exposure by credit rating of the counterparties and provide guidance on the concentration of credit risk to individual counterparties and an indication of the duration of a company’s credit risk by credit rating of the counterparties the figures in the table below exclude credit risk exposure from individual retail customers uranium procurement contracts and exposure through rtos isos and commodity exchanges which are discussed below 



 

a as of december 31 2021 credit collateral held from counterparties where we had credit exposure included 163 million of cash and 60 million of letters of credit 





creditriskrelated contingent features 

as part of the normal course of business we routinely enter into physical or financial contracts for the sale and purchase of electricity natural gas and other commodities in accordance with the contracts and applicable law if we are downgraded by a credit rating agency especially if such downgrade is to a level below investment grade it is possible that a counterparty would attempt to rely on such a downgrade as a basis for making a demand for adequate assurance of future performance depending on our net position with a counterparty the demand could be for the posting of collateral in the absence of expressly agreedto provisions that specify the collateral that must be provided collateral requested will be a function of the facts and circumstances of the situation at the time of the demand see note 16 — derivative financial instruments of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding collateral requirements and note 19 — commitments and contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the letters of credit supporting the cash collateral 

we transact output through bilateral contracts the bilateral contracts are subject to credit risk which relates to the ability of counterparties to meet their contractual payment obligations any failure to collect these payments from counterparties could have a material impact on our financial statements as market prices rise above or fall below contracted price levels we are required to post collateral with purchasers as market prices fall below contracted price levels counterparties are required to post collateral with us to post collateral we depend on access to bank credit facilities which serve as liquidity sources to fund collateral requirements see item 7 liquidity and capital resources — credit matters — credit facilities for additional information 

rtos and isos 

we participate in all or some of the established wholesale spot energy markets that are administered by pjm isone nyiso caiso miso spp aeso oieso and ercot ercot is not subject to regulation by ferc but performs a similar function in texas to that performed by rtos in markets regulated by ferc in these areas power is traded through bilateral agreements between buyers and sellers and on the spot energy markets that are administered by the rtos or isos as applicable in areas where there is no spot energy market electricity is purchased and sold solely through bilateral agreements for sales into the spot markets administered by an rto or iso the rto or iso maintains financial assurance policies that are established and enforced by those administrators the credit policies of the rtos and isos may under certain circumstances require that losses arising from the default of one member on spot energy market transactions be shared by the remaining participants nonperformance or nonpayment by a major counterparty could result in a material 

adverse impact on our financial statements see note 3 — regulatory matters of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the february 2021 extreme cold weather event and texasbased generating asset outages 

exchange traded transactions 

we enter into commodity transactions on nymex ice nasdaq ngx and the nodal exchange the exchanges the exchange clearinghouses act as the counterparty to each trade transactions on the exchanges must adhere to comprehensive collateral and margining requirements as a result transactions on exchanges are significantly collateralized and have limited counterparty credit risk 

interest rate and foreign exchange risk 

we use a combination of fixedrate and variablerate debt to manage interest rate exposure we may also utilize interest rate swaps to manage our interest rate exposure a hypothetical 50 basis point increase in the interest rates associated with unhedged variablerate debt excluding commercial paper and fixedtofloating swaps would result in approximately a 2 million decrease in our pretax income for the year ended december 31 2021 to manage foreign exchange rate exposure associated with international energy purchases in currencies other than us dollars we utilize foreign currency derivatives which are typically designated as economic hedges see note 16 — derivative financial instruments of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

equity price risk 

we maintain trust funds as required by the nrc to fund the costs of decommissioning our nuclear plants our ndt funds are reflected at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets the mix of securities in the trust funds is designed to provide returns to be used to fund decommissioning and to compensate us for inflationary increases in decommissioning costs however the equity securities in the trust funds are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets and the value of fixedrate fixedincome securities are exposed to changes in interest rates we actively monitor the investment performance of the trust funds and periodically review asset allocations in accordance with our ndt fund investment policy a hypothetical 25 basis points increase in interest rates and 10 decrease in equity prices would result in a 892 million reduction in the fair value of the trust assets as of december 31 2021 this calculation holds all other variables constant and assumes only the discussed changes in interest rates and equity prices see liquidity and capital resources section of item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional information

for both the ceo and neos a significant portion of their compensation is tied to the achievement of shortterm and longterm financial and operational goals and is paid in the form of exelon equity with all components except for salary being “atrisk”

2021 annual incentive plan aip overview and goal setting 

aip metrics are linked to business goals and strategic focus areas the goalsetting process employs a multilayer approach and analysis that incorporates a blend of objective and subjective business considerations and other analytical methods to ensure that the goals are sufficiently rigorous such considerations include 

recent history  goals generally reflect a logical progression of results from the recent past 

relative performance  performance is evaluated against a relevant group of constellation and its subsidiaries’ peers 

strategic aspirations  near and intermediateterm goals follow a trend line consistent with longterm aspirations 

shareholder expectations  goals are aligned with externally communicated financial guidance and shareholder expectations 

sustainable sharing  earned awards reflect a balanced degree of shared benefits between shareholders and participants 

the following process was used to determine 2021 aip awards for each neo 

1 set aip target  expressed as percentage of base salary mr crane’s annual incentive target was 145 and for the other neos the annual incentive targets ranged from 50100 

2 determine performance factor  based on various financial and operating metrics 

3 determine individual performance multiplier ipm – ipm measures individual performance and ranged from 50 to 110 target of 100 wright and rhoades were the only executives eligible for an ipm up to a maximum of 110 there were no ipms for the other neos the ipms were approved by mr crane 

4 apply final multiplier – multiply the target award by the performance factor and then multiply the outcome by the ipm awards could range from 0 to 200 of target target of 100 

the following tables detail the 2021 threshold target and distinguished ie maximum performance goals and the results achieved for the aip the exelon compensation committee selected the performance metrics below as they align with the longterm business strategy actual results reflected below are assessed based on the operational and financial key performance indicators as assigned to each business unit 

ceo and direct reports aip scorecard 



comed senior aip scorecard 



business service center aip scorecard 



constellation corporate aip scorecard 



commercial senior aip scorecard 



nuclear senior aip scorecard 



 

a exelon’s 2021 adjusted eps was 282 however for purposes of determining the 2021 aip payouts for exelon executives 294 was used which includes the impact of 012 attributed to equity investments

definition of nongaap measures 

exelon reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap and supplements its reporting with certain nongaap financial measures including adjusted nongaap operating earnings per share earned roe and ffodebt to enhance investors’ understanding of exelon’s performance our method of calculating adjusted nongaap operating earnings and operating roe may not be comparable to other companies’ presentations 

adjusted nongaap operating earnings per share exclude certain costs expenses gains and losses and other specified items including marktomarket adjustments from economic hedging activities unrealized gains and losses from nuclear decommissioning trust fund investments certain costs associated with plant retirements and divestitures costs related to cost management programs and other items as set forth in the table below reconciling adjusted nongaap operating earnings from gaap earnings which is the most directly comparable gaap measure management uses adjusted nongaap operating earnings as one of the primary indicators to evaluate performance allocate resources set incentive compensation targets and plan and forecast future periods we believe the measure enhances an investor’s overall understanding of period over period financial results and provides an indication of exelon’s baseline operating performance by excluding items that are considered by management to not be directly related to the ongoing operations of the business 

the table below reconciles reported gaap earnings per share to adjusted nongaap operating earnings per share for 2020 amounts may not add due to rounding 



earned roe is calculated using adjusted nongaap operating earnings reflecting all lines of business for the utility businesses electric distribution gas distribution transmission divided by average shareholder’s equity over the year management uses operating roe as a measurement of the actual performance of the company’s utility business 

ffodebt is a coverage ratio that compares funds from operations to total debt and is a key ratio analyzed by the credit rating agencies in determining exelon’s credit rating an investment grade rating is critical as it increases the ability to participate in commercial business opportunities lowers collateral requirements creates reliable and costefficient access to capital markets and increases business and financial flexibility the ratio is calculated following sp’s current methodology the most directly comparable gaap measure to ffo is gaap cash flow from operations and the most directly comparable gaap measure to debt is longterm debt plus shortterm borrowings management uses ffodebt to evaluate financial risk by measuring the company’s ability to service debt using cash from operations we believe the measure enhances an investor’s overall understanding of the creditworthiness of exelon’s operating companies 

comed adjusted nongaap operating earnings excludes certain costs expenses gains and losses and other specified items as determined appropriate by exelon management when evaluating the performance metrics 

constellation adjusted nongaap operating earnings excludes certain costs expenses gains and losses and other specified items including marktomarket adjustments rate relief payments and other items as determined appropriate by exelon management when evaluating the performance metrics 

commercial adjusted gross margin is the total operating revenues less purchased power and fuel for the commercial wholesale business and for the commercial retail services businesses includes direct costs and is net of any nonoperating adjustments to either operating revenue or purchased power and fuel 

utility adjusted nongaap operating earnings is the aggregate utility adjusted nongaap operating earnings including exelon holdco adjusted nongaap operating earnings 

total comed operating and maintenance expense excludes certain costs expenses and other specified items as determined appropriate by exelon management when evaluating the performance metrics 

bsc total costs represents exelon business service company costs excluding certain costs expenses and other specified items as determined appropriate by exelon management when evaluating the performance metrics 

due to the forwardlooking nature of some forecasted nongaap measures information to reconcile the forecasted adjusted nongaap measures to the most directly comparable gaap measure may not be currently available therefore management is unable to reconcile these measures 

the following table shows how the formula was applied and the actual amounts awarded the exelon compensation committee applied negative discretion to limit the comed senior and business service center scorecards to 120 of target and the constellation corporate scorecard to target

longterm incentive plan ltip overview  goal setting process 

the exelon compensation committee grants longterm equity incentive awards annually at its january or february meeting when the total target equity incentive award is determined the value is split between rsus 33 and performance shares 67 

restricted stock units “rsus” rsus granted to neos vest ratably over a threeyear period rsus receive dividend equivalents that are reinvested as additional rsus and remain subject to the same vesting conditions as the underlying rsus rsus are not subject to any performance metrics 

performance shares performance shares granted to neos in january 2021 were converted according to the methodology outlined in the employee matters agreement awards will be earned based on performance achieved for the scorecard approved by the constellation committee covering the twoyear period ending on december 31 2023 the performance metrics underlying the 20192021 and 20202022 performance share awards are listed below

setting performance share targets performance share targets are set based on external commitments and analysis of sensitivities the target for the exelon ffodebt metric is aligned with the expectations of credit rating agencies 

actual targets disclosed after each cycle actual targets used in our performance share cycles are not disclosed until each cycle is completed to safeguard the confidentiality of our longterm outlook on projected performance this policy supports the propriety of our longstanding disclosure practices to only issue annual performance guidance as part of our financial disclosure policies 

performance share awards subject to tsr modifier and cap performance share awards are subject to a total shareholder return “tsr” modifier that compares exelon’s performance relative to the performance of the uty total return index on a point by point basis performance share awards are also subject to a tsr cap that will limit payouts at target if tsr is negative for the prior 36month period 

the exelon compensation committee used the following process to determine performance share targets and awards 

1 establish performance share award target  targets are set in januaryfebruary of the first year of the performance cycle 

2 determine performance multiplier  the performance multiplier is based on performance achieved over the threeyear cycle performance can range from 0 to 150 of target target of 100 

3 determine tsr modifier  calculated by subtracting the tsr of the uty over the threeyear performance period from exelon’s tsr for the same threeyear period 

4 calculate final multiplier  calculated by multiplying the performance multiplier by 100  tsr modifier this value is the final multiplier 

5 apply final multiplier  tsr cap if applicable  apply the final multiplier to determine the number of shares issued if exelon’s absolute tsr for the final 12month of the performance period is negative payout will be capped at 100 awards can range from 0 to 200 of target target of 100 after application of the tsr modifier 

2019 – 2021 performance and performance share payout determinations 

the following table details the 2019  2021 threshold target and distinguished performance goals and the results achieved the performance multiplier for the 2019  2021 performance share awards was calculated to be 805 of target based on the following 

  

a see definitions of nongaap measures beginning on page 173 

b the utility earned roe and utility net income use interpolation between threshold target and distinguished levels of performance whereas the ffodebt metric uses a “stairstep” approach with no interpolation between the performance levels 

payout determinations  the exelon compensation committee approved a payout of 706 based on 2019  2021 performance and the application of a tsr modifier of 123 based on 2019  2021 tsr performance relative to the uty total return 

the following table shows how the formula was applied and the actual amounts awarded 



performance awards settled in common stock andor cash pursuant to the terms of the longterm incentive program all neos that have achieved 200 or more of their stock ownership targets receive performance share award payouts in cash due to the timing of the separation the exelon compensation committee approved 100 cash settlement for all participants 

2021 target compensation for named executive officers 

the table below lists the target value of the compensation elements for each neo as of december 31 2021 



shareholder engagement 

the exelon compensation committee regularly reviews executive compensation taking into consideration input received through regular and ongoing engagement with investors feedback is typically solicited throughout the year in connection with the annual meeting of shareholders and the exelon compensation committee’s review of the executive compensation program the chairs of exelon’s compensation and corporate governance committees participated in select investor discussions in 2021 feedback from all discussions was shared with the appropriate board committee andor the full board shareholders in general expressed their approval of the ongoing executive compensation program and did not request any significant changes during our engagement conversations 

2021 compensation decisions – setting target total direct compensation “tdc” 

setting target tdc for mr crane the exelon compensation committee is responsible for reviewing and recommending the exelon ceo’s target total direct compensation the ceo’s compensation is then approved by the independent members of the exelon board the exelon compensation committee fulfills this responsibility by analyzing peer group compensation and performance data with its independent compensation consultant the committee also reviews the various elements of the ceo’s compensation in the context of the target tdc which includes base salary annual and longterm incentive target opportunities 

setting target tdc for messrs hanson and mchugh the exelon compensation committee is also responsible for approving the executive compensation for each of exelon’s executive officers by analyzing peer group compensation and performance data 

setting target tdc for the other neos the exelon ceo analyzes a variety of data to gauge market competitiveness including peer group compensation and performance data provided by exelon’s independent compensation consultant tdc can vary by named executive officer based on competencies and skills scope of responsibilities the executive’s experience and performance retention succession planning and the organizational structure of the businesses eg internal alignment and reporting relationships 

role of the compensation consultant 

as referenced earlier the exelon compensation committee retains meridian compensation partners llc “meridian” an independent compensation consultant to support its duties and responsibilities meridian provides advice and counsel on executive and director compensation matters and provides information and advice regarding market trends competitive compensation programs and strategies including as described below 

• market data for each senior executive position including evaluating exelon’s compensation strategy and reviewing and confirming the peer group used to prepare the market data 

• an independent assessment of management recommendations for changes in the compensation structure 

• assisting management to ensure constellation and its subsidiaries’ executive compensation programs are designed and administered consistent with the exelon compensation committee’s requirements and 

• ad hoc support on executive compensation matters and related governance trends 

peer groups used for benchmarking 2021 executive compensation 

exelon uses a blended peer group for assessing our executive compensation program that consists of two subgroups energy services peers and general industry peers because 1 there are not enough energy services peers with size scale and complexity comparable to exelon to create a robust energy servicesonly peer group and 2 exelon’s market for attracting talent includes general industry peers with key executives hired from several fortune 100 companies when selecting general industry peers we look for capital assetintensive companies with size scale and complexity similar to exelon and we also consider the extent to which they may be subject to the effects of volatile commodity prices similar to exelon’s sensitivity to commodity price volatility exelon evaluates its peer group on an annual basis in july and adjusts for changes with our energy and general industry peers when needed 

exelon’s revenues are at the 64th percentile of the following blended peer group comprising 21 companies 

1 energy services 11 peer companies american electric power company inc dominion energy inc dte energy duke energy corporation edison international entergy corporation firstenergy corporation nextera energy inc public service enterprise group inc sempra energy and the southern company 

2 general industry 10 peer companies 3m company deere  company delta air lines general dynamics corporation honeywell international inc international paper company lockheed martin marathon petroleum company northrop grumman corporation and valero energy corporation 

because there is a correlation between the size of an organization and its compensation levels market data is statistically adjusted using a regression analysis this commonly applied technique allows for a more precise estimate of the market value of constellation and its subsidiaries given the size and scope of responsibility for constellation and its subsidiaries’ executive roles each element of neo compensation is then compared to these sizeadjusted medians of the peer group 

in preparation for the separation a blended peer group consisting of a broad representation of energy and materials companies was used for benchmarking the assessment of 2022 compensation for named executive officers of the company constellation will also evaluate its peer group on an annual basis in july and adjusts for changes with our energy and general industry peers when needed 

constellation’s revenues are at the 64th percentile of the following blended peer group comprising 15 companies 

1 energy services and independent power producers ipps 9 peer companies american electric power company inc dominion energy inc duke energy corporation entergy corporation nextera energy inc nrg energy inc the aes corporation vistra corp and the southern company 

2 general industry 6 peer companies dupont de nemours inc international paper company kinder morgan inc nucor corporation occidental petroleum corporation and westrock company 

looking forward to 2022 

annual incentive plan 

based on overall company strategy the 2022 plan design will be based 70 on a financial metric and 30 on operational metrics 

the plan design metric weightings include 

• 70 weighting on adjusted ebitda 

• 10 weighting on fleetwide capacity factor as assessment of nuclear operational performance 

• 10 weighting on dispatch match as assessment of power operational performance and 

• 10 on customer satisfaction which considers both net promoter score which measures ci business customer loyalty and customer satisfaction which measures residential satisfaction from recent support experience 

longterm incentive plan 

the longterm incentive plan is aligned with the constellation business strategy the 2021 and 2022 pshare programs will be based on a 100 free cash flow before growth metric with a cfodebt negative modifier 

stock ownership 

to strengthen the alignment of executive interests with those of exelon’s shareholders officers of constellation and its subsidiaries are required to own certain amounts of exelon common stock five years following his or her employment or promotion to a new position sixtimes base salary for mr crane two to three times base salary for the other neos as of the annual measurement date of june 30 2021 all neos had met their stock ownership guidelines we expect to adopt a similar stock ownership policy for officers of the company 

prohibition on hedging and pledging of common stock other trading requirements 

exelon requires executive vice presidents and above who wish to sell exelon common stock to do so only through the adoption of a stock trading plan meeting the requirements of sec rule 10b51c this requirement is designed to enable officers with the ability to diversify holdings in an orderly manner to meet personal financial plans our insider trading policy includes provisions that prohibit directors and employees including officers and certain of their related persons including certain family members and entities which they own a significant interest from engaging in short sales put or call options hedging transactions pledging or other derivative transactions involving exelon stock we expect to adopt a similar policy for officers of the company 

clawback policy 

the policy provides broad discretionary ability to clawback incentive compensation when deemed appropriate under the policy the exelon board has sole discretion to recoup incentive compensation if it determines that a the incentive compensation was based on the achievement of financial or other results that were subsequently restated or corrected b the incentive plan participant engaged in fraud or intentional misconduct that caused or contributed to the need for restatement or correction c a lower incentive plan award would have been made to the participant based on the restated or corrected results and d recoupment is not precluded by applicable law or employment agreements 

the exelon board or exelon compensation committee may also seek to recoup incentive compensation paid or payable to current or former incentive plan participants if in its sole discretion the exelon board or exelon compensation committee determines that a the current or former incentive plan participant breached a restrictive covenant or engaged or participated in misconduct or intentional or reckless acts or omissions or serious neglect of responsibilities that caused or contributed to a significant financial loss or serious reputational harm to exelon or its subsidiaries regardless of whether a financial statement restatement or correction of incentive plan results was required and b recoupment is not precluded by applicable law or employment agreements 

we have adopted clawback policies that are similar to those maintained by exelon 

risk management assessment of compensation policies and practices 

the exelon compensation committee reviews exelon’s compensation policies and practices as they relate to the risk management practices and risktaking incentives the exelon compensation committee partners with constellation’s enterprise risk management group to assess and validate that the controls in place continued to mitigate incentive compensation risks 

tax consequences 

under section 162m of the internal revenue code the code generally neo compensation over 1 million for any year is not deductible for united states income tax purposes the compensation and leadership development committee believes that it must maintain flexibility in its approach to executive compensation in order to structure a program that it considers to be the most effective in attracting motivating and retaining the company’s key executives and therefore the deductibility of compensation is one of several factors considered when making executive compensation decisions 

compensation committee report 

the compensation committee has reviewed and discussed with management the compensation discussion and analysis and based on such review and discussion the committee recommended the board approve the compensation discussion and analysis be included in this report

pension benefits 

the plans below were sponsored by exelon corporation as of december 31 2021 and that as of february 1 2022 constellation established mirror pension plans to maintain the same benefits described below for neos 

exelon sponsors the exelon corporation retirement program a defined benefit pension plan that includes the service annuity system sas a traditional pension plan covering neos who commenced employment prior to january 1 2001 and the cash balance pension plan “cbpp” an accountbased plan covering eligible neos hired between january 1 2001 and february 1 2018 and certain neos who previously elected to transfer to the cbpp from the sas exelon also sponsors the pension plan of constellation energy group inc “ceg pension plan” which covers certain legacy constellation energy group inc employees it includes a traditional pension formula for employees hired before january 1 2000 and a pension equity formula “pep” for employees hired thereafter or who elected to participate in that formula the retirement program and ceg pension plan are intended to be taxqualified under section 401a of the internal revenue code 

service annuity system “sas” 

for neos participating in the sas the annuity benefit payable at normal retirement age is equal to the sum of 13 of the participant’s earnings as of december 25 1994 reduced by a portion of the participant’s social security benefit as of that date plus 16 of the participant’s highest average annual pay multiplied by the participant’s years of credited service up to a maximum of 40 years pensioneligible compensation for the sas’s final average pay formula includes base pay and annual incentive awards benefits under the sas are vested after five years of service 

the “normal retirement age” under the sas is 65 the plan also offers an early retirement benefit prior to age 65 which is payable if a participant retires after attainment of age 50 and completion of 10 years of service the annual pension payable under the plan is determined as of the early retirement date reduced by 2 for each year of payment before age 60 to age 58 then 3 for each year before age 58 to age 50 in addition under the sas the early retirement benefit is supplemented prior to age 65 by a temporary payment equal to 80 of the participant’s estimated monthly social security benefit the supplemental benefit is partially offset by a reduction in the regular annuity benefit 

cash balance pension plan “cbpp” 

for neos who participate in the cbpp a notional account is established for each participant and the account balance grows as a result of annual benefit credits and annual investment credits neos who transferred from the sas to the cbpp also have a frozen transferred sas benefit and received a “transition” credit based on age service and compensation at the time of transfer when the cbpp was initially established in 2001 it provided an annual benefit credit of 58 of an employee’s base pay and annual incentive award for the year and an annual investment credit based on the average of that year’s sp 500 stock index return and the 30year treasury rate for the month of november subject to 4 minimum the benefit credit percentages and investment credit rates have been subsequently modified periodically pursuant to us treasury department guidance on cash balance plans neo participants in the cbpp currently receive an annual benefit credit ranging from 70 to 105 depending on length of service of base salary and annual incentive award and an annual investment credit based on the third segment spot rate of interest on longterm investment grade corporate bonds for the month of november of the year credited subject to a 4 minimum benefits vest after three years of service and are payable in an annuity or a lump sum at any time following termination of employment apart from the benefit credits and the vesting requirement years of service are not relevant to a determination of accrued benefits under the cbpp
