competition 

the computing industry continuously evolves with new and enhanced technologies and products from existing and new providers the marketplace can change quickly in response to the introduction of such technologies and products and other factors such as changes in customer and enduser requirements expectations and preferences as technologies evolve and new market segments emerge the boundaries between the market segments that we compete in are also subject to change 

intel faces significant competition in the development and market acceptance of our products in this environment our platforms based on intel architecture are positioned to compete across the compute continuum from the lowest power and mobile devices to the most powerful data center servers these platforms have integrated hardware and software and offer customers benefits such as ease of use savings in total cost of ownership and the ability to scale systems to accommodate increased usage 

competitors 

we compete against other companies that make and sell platforms other silicon components and software to businesses that build and sell computing and communications systems to end users our competitors also include companies that sell goods and services to businesses that use them for their internal andor customerfacing processes eg businesses running large data centers in addition we face competition from oems odms and other industrial and communications equipment manufacturers that to some degree choose to vertically integrate their own proprietary semiconductor and software assets by doing so these competitors may be attempting to offer greater differentiation in their products and to increase their share of the profits for each finished product they sell continuing changes in industry participants through for example acquisitions or business collaborations could also have a significant impact on our competitive position 

in the pc market segment we are a leading provider of platforms for traditional desktops and notebooks we face existing and emerging competition in these product areas tablets phones and other mobile devices offered by numerous vendors are significant competitors to traditional pcs for many usages and considerable blurring of system form factors currently exists in the marketplace we are a relatively recent provider of platforms for tablets and phones and we face strong competition from vendors that use applications processors based on the arm architecture feature lowpower long batterylife operation and are built in soc formats that integrate numerous functions on one chip 

in the data center market segment we are a leading provider of data center platforms and face competition from companies using arm architecture or other technologies internet cloud computing storage and networking are areas of significant targeted growth for us in the data center segment and we face strong competition in these market segments 

in the internet of things market segment we have a longstanding position as a supplier of components and software for embedded products this marketplace continues to expand significantly with increasing types and numbers of smart and connected devices for industrial commercial and consumer uses such as wearables as this market segment evolves we face numerous large and small incumbent processor competitors as well as new entrants that use arm architecture and other operating systems and software in addition the internet of things requires a broad range of connectivity solutions and we face competition from companies providing traditional wireless solutions such as cellular wifi and bluetooth as well as several new entrants who are taking advantage of new focused communications protocols 

in the memory market segment we compete against other providers of nand flash memory products we focus our efforts primarily on incorporating nand flash memory into solution products such as solidstate drives supporting enterprise and consumer applications we believe that our memory offerings including innovative developments such as intel ®  optane™ technology complement our product offerings in our other segments 

our security business operates in highly competitive fragmented and rapidly changing market segments we are a major provider of cybersecurity products and services to both businesses and consumers for businesses we compete with companies selling individual point security products and companies selling multiple security products we offer businesses a portfolio of products that are integrated into a comprehensive security solution for consumers we primarily compete against other major security companies and providers of free security products our consumer offerings are designed to protect user data identity and devices across the compute continuum 

in the programmable solutions market segment we are a leading provider of programmable semiconductors and related products including fpgas and soc fpgas we face competition from other programmable logic companies as well as companies that make other types of semiconductor products such as applicationspecific integrated circuits asics applicationspecific standard products assps graphics processing units gpus digital signal processors dsps and cpus targeted growth areas for our programmable solutions include communications data center and automotive applications the fpga life cycle is long relative to other intel products—from the time that a design win is secured it generally takes three or more years before a customer starts volume production and we receive the associated revenue from such design win 

our products primarily compete based on performance energy efficiency integration innovative design features price quality reliability brand recognition technical support and availability the importance of these factors varies by the type of end system for the products for example performance might be among the most important factors for our products for data center servers while price and integration might be among the most important factors for our products for tablets phones and other mobile devices 

competitive advantages 

our key competitive advantages include 



manufacturing and assembly and test 

in 2016 the majority of our wafer manufacturing was conducted within the us manufacturing conducted within and outside the us may be impacted by the timing of a facility’s transition to a newer process technology as well as a facility’s capacity utilization 

we manufacture our products in facilities at the following locations 

as of december 31 2016  our microprocessors were manufactured on 300mm wafers with a substantial majority  manufactured using our 14nm and 22nm process technologies we continue to develop new generations of manufacturing process technology and realize the benefits which enable silicon designs with less space per transistor reduced heat output from each transistor and increased number of integrated features on each chip these advancements make possible innovations of new products with higher functionality while controlling power cost and size we incur factory startup costs as we ramp our facilities for a new process technology in 2017 we announced plans to complete our arizona facility which is targeted for 7nm process technology 

we use thirdparty foundries to manufacture wafers for certain components including communications connectivity networking fpga and memory products in addition we primarily use subcontractors to manufacture boardlevel products and systems we purchase certain communications and connectivity products from external vendors primarily in the asiapacific region in addition to the assembly and test facilities presented on the map we use subcontractors to augment capacity to perform assembly and test of certain products primarily chipsets and communications fpgas connectivity and memory products 

we utilize a multisource strategy for our memory business to enable a robust and flexible supply chain in 2016 we began ramping our facility in dalian china to produce leadingedge nonvolatile memory this expansion enables us to maintain a costeffective strategy to best serve our customers in 3d nand in addition to our strategic investments to manufacture memory internally we have a supplemental supply agreement with micron technology inc micron as well as capacity from the joint venture im flash technologies llc imft factory in lehi utah for further information on imft see  note 9 investments  in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

our employment and operating practices are consistent with and we expect our suppliers and subcontractors to abide by local country law intel expects all suppliers to comply with the intel code of conduct and the electronic industry citizenship coalition eicc code of conduct both of which set standards that address the rights of workers to safe and healthy working conditions environmental responsibility compliance with privacy and data security obligations and compliance with applicable laws for more information about supplychain responsibility refer to corporate responsibility and sustainability below and our corporate responsibility report available on intels website 

we have thousands of suppliers including subcontractors fulfilling our various materials equipment and service needs we set expectations for supplier performance and reinforce those expectations with periodic assessments and audits we regularly communicate those expectations and work with our suppliers to implement improvements when necessary where possible we seek to have several sources of supply for all materials and resources however we may rely on a single or limited number of suppliers or upon suppliers in a single country in those cases we develop and implement plans and actions to reduce the exposure that would result from a disruption in supply we have entered into longterm contracts with certain suppliers to help ensure a stable supply of silicon and semiconductor manufacturing tools 

our products are typically manufactured at multiple intel facilities around the world or by subcontractors however some products are manufactured in only one intel or subcontractor facility and we seek to reduce the exposure that would result from a disruption at any such facility 

employees 

as of december 31 2016  we had 106000  employees worldwide with approximately 50  of those employees located in the us 

research and development 

we are committed to investing in worldclass technology development particularly in the design and manufacture of integrated circuits rd expenditures were 127 billion  in 2016   121 billion  in 2015  and 115 billion  in 2014  

our rd activities are directed toward the delivery of solutions consisting of hardware and software platforms and supporting services across a wide range of computing devices we are focused on developing the technology innovations that we believe will deliver our next generation of products which will in turn enable new form factors and usage models for businesses and consumers we focus our rd efforts on advanced computing technologies developing new microarchitectures advancing our silicon manufacturing process technology delivering the next generation of platforms improving our platform initiatives developing new solutions in emerging technologies including memory and the internet of things and developing software solutions and tools our rd efforts are intended to enable new levels of performance and address areas such as energy efficiency systemlevel integration security scalability for multicore architectures system manageability and ease of use 

as part of our rd efforts we plan to introduce new microarchitectures for our various products on a regular cadence we expect to lengthen the amount of time we will utilize our 14nm and our nextgeneration 10nm process technologies with multiple waves of product offerings further optimizing our technologies while meeting the yearly market cadence for product introductions 

advances in our silicon technology have enabled us to continue making moore’s law a reality in 2014 we began manufacturing our 5th generation intel core processor family using our 14 nm process technology in 2015 we released a new microarchitecture our 6th generation intel core processor family using our 14nm process technology we enhanced the 14nm process on our 7th generation intel core processor family in 2016 and plan to further optimize our technologies with the upcoming 8th generation intel core processor family in 2017 we continue to make progress on developing our nextgeneration 10nm manufacturing process technology 

we have continued expanding on the advances anticipated by moore’s law by bringing new capabilities into silicon and producing new products optimized for a wider variety of applications we expect that these advances will result in a significant reduction in transistor leakage lower active power and an increase in transistor density these advances in our process technologies will enable new classes of products from smart and connected things and devices to high performance systems that power data centers for instance we offer the intel ®  atom™ processorbased intel ®  joule™ compute module a highperformance systemonmodule designed to enable developers and entrepreneurs to go from concept to prototype to production in less time and at lower cost than with traditional system development 

with our continued focus on silicon and manufacturing technology leadership we entered into a series of agreements with asml holding nv asml in 2012 certain of which were amended in 2014 to further define the commercial terms between the parties these amended agreements in which intel agreed to provide rd funding over five years are intended to accelerate the development of extreme ultraviolet euv lithography projects and deep ultraviolet immersion lithography projects including generic developments applicable to both 300mm and 450mm 

our rd activities include initiatives that further enhance our platform solutions for example 

 our rd model is based on a global organization that emphasizes a collaborative approach to identifying and developing new technologies leading standards initiatives and influencing regulatory policies to accelerate the adoption of new technologies including joint pathfinding conducted between researchers at intel labs and our business groups we centrally manage key crossbusiness group product initiatives to align and prioritize our rd activities across these groups in addition we may augment our rd activities by investing in companies or entering into agreements with companies that have similar rd focus areas as well as directly purchasing or licensing technology applicable to our rd initiatives to drive innovation and gain efficiencies we intend to utilize our investments in intellectual property and rd across our market segments 

sales and marketing 

customers 

we sell our products primarily to oems and odms odms provide design and manufacturing services to branded and unbranded privatelabel resellers in addition our customers include other manufacturers and service providers such as industrial and communication equipment manufacturers and cloud service providers who buy our products through distributor reseller retail and oem channels throughout the world for more information about our customers including customers who accounted for greater than 10 of our net consolidated revenue see  note 4 operating segments and geographic information  in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

our worldwide reseller sales channel consists of thousands of indirect customers—systems builders that purchase intel ®  processors and other products from our distributors we have a program that allows distributors to sell our microprocessors and other products in small quantities to customers of systems builders our microprocessors and other products are also available in direct retail outlets 

sales arrangements 

our products are sold through sales offices throughout the world sales of our products are frequently made via purchase order acknowledgments that contain standard terms and conditions covering matters such as pricing payment terms and warranties as well as indemnities for issues specific to our products such as patent and copyright indemnities from time to time we may enter into additional agreements with customers covering for example changes from our standard terms and conditions new product development and marketing privatelabel branding and other matters our sales are routinely made using electronic and webbased processes that allow the customer to review inventory availability and track the progress of specific goods ordered pricing on particular products may vary based on volumes ordered and other factors we also offer discounts rebates and other incentives to customers to increase acceptance of our products and technology 

our products are generally shipped under terms that transfer title to the customer even in arrangements for which the recognition of revenue and related cost of sales is deferred our standard terms and conditions of sale typically provide that payment is due at a later date usually 30 days after shipment or delivery we assess credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis from this analysis we establish shipping and credit limits and determine whether we will seek to use one or more credit support protection devices such as obtaining a parent guarantee standby letter of credit or credit insurance  credit losses may still be incurred due to bankruptcy fraud or other failure of the customer to pay 

our sales to distributors are typically made under agreements allowing for price protection on unsold merchandise and a right of return on stipulated quantities of unsold merchandise under the price protection program we give distributors credits for the difference between the original price paid and the current price that we offer our products typically have no contractual limit on the amount of price protection nor is there a limit on the time horizon under which price protection is granted the right of return granted generally consists of a stock rotation program in which distributors are able to exchange certain products based on the number of qualified purchases made by the distributor 

distribution 

distributors typically handle a wide variety of products including those that compete with our products and fill orders for many customers customers may place orders directly with us or through distributors we have several distribution warehouses that are located in proximity to key customers 

backlog 

over time our larger customers have generally moved to leaninventory or justintime operations rather than maintaining larger inventories of our products as our customers continue to lower their inventories our processes to fulfill their orders have evolved to meet their needs as a result our manufacturing production is based on estimates and advance nonbinding commitments from customers as to future purchases our order backlog as of any particular date is a mix of these commitments and specific firm orders that are primarily made pursuant to standard purchase orders for delivery of products only a small portion of our orders are noncancelable and the dollar amount associated with the noncancelable portion is not significant 

seasonal trends 

historically our net revenue has typically been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year accelerating in the third quarter and peaking in the fourth quarter 

marketing 

our global marketing objectives are to build a strong wellknown intel corporate brand that connects with businesses and consumers and to offer a limited number of meaningful and valuable brands in our portfolio to aid businesses and consumers in making informed choices about technology purchases the intel core processor family and the intel ®  quark™ intel ®  atom™ intel ®  celeron ®  intel ®  pentium ®  intel ®  xeon ®  intel ®  xeon phi™ and intel ®  itanium ®  trademarks make up our processor brands 

we promote brand awareness and preference and generate demand through our own direct marketing as well as through comarketing programs our direct marketing activities primarily include advertising through digital and social media and television as well as consumer and trade events industry and consumer communications and press relations we market to consumer and business audiences and focus on building awareness and generating demand for new form factors such as allinone devices and 2 in 1 systems powered by intel our key messaging focuses on increased performance improved energy efficiency and other capabilities such as connectivity and communications 

purchases by customers often allow them to participate in cooperative advertising and marketing programs such as the intel inside ®  program this program broadens the reach of our brands beyond the scope of our own direct marketing through the intel inside program certain customers are licensed to place intel ®  logos on computing devices containing our microprocessors and processor technologies and to use our brands in their marketing activities the program includes a market development component that accrues funds based on purchases and partially reimburses customers for marketing activities for products featuring intel ®  brands subject to customers meeting defined criteria these marketing activities primarily include advertising through digital and social media and television as well as press relations we have also entered into joint marketing arrangements with certain customers 

intellectual property rights and licensing 

intel owns significant intellectual property ip and related ip rights around the world that relate to our products services rd and other activities and assets our ip portfolio includes patents copyrights trade secrets trademarks trade dress rights and maskwork rights we actively seek to protect our global ip rights and to deter unauthorized use of our ip and other assets such efforts can be difficult however particularly in countries that provide less protection to ip rights and in the absence of harmonized international ip standards while our ip rights are important to our success our business as a whole is not significantly dependent on any single patent copyright or other ip right 

we have obtained patents in the us and other countries because of the fast pace of innovation and product development and the comparative pace of governments’ patenting processes our products are often obsolete before the patents related to them expire in some cases our products may be obsolete before the patents related to them are granted as we expand our products into new industries we also seek to extend our patent development efforts to patent such products in addition to developing patents based on our own rd efforts we purchase patents from third parties to supplement our patent portfolio established competitors in existing and new industries as well as companies that purchase and enforce patents and other ip may already have patents covering similar products there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain patents covering our own products or that we will be able to obtain licenses from other companies on favorable terms or at all 

the software that we distribute including software embedded in our componentlevel and platform products is entitled to copyright and other ip protection to distinguish our products from our competitors’ products we have obtained trademarks and trade names for our products and we maintain cooperative advertising programs with customers to promote our brands and to identify products containing genuine intel components we also protect details about our processes products and strategies as trade secrets keeping confidential the information that we believe provides us with a competitive advantage 

corporate responsibility and sustainability 

we have a long history of leadership in corporate responsibility and set ambitious goals and drive improvements in key focus areas of environmental sustainability supply chain responsibility diversity and inclusion and social impact

 item 1a risk factors 

the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our common stock could decline these risk factors do not identify all risks that we face our operations could also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations due to risks and uncertainties known and unknown our past financial results may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods refer also to the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k including management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and our financial statements and the related notes 

changes in product demand can adversely affect our financial results 

demand for our products is variable and hard to predict changes   in the demand for our products may reduce our revenue increase our costs lower our gross margin percentage or require us to write down the value of our assets our platform products are used across different market segments and demand for our platforms may vary within or among our client computing data center internet of things and other market segments it is difficult to anticipate the impact of these changes as demand may increase in one or more market segments while decreasing in others important factors that could lead to variation in the demand for our products include changes in 

 we face significant competition the   industry in which we operate is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological and market developments changes in industry standards changes in customer needs and frequent product introductions and improvements if we do not anticipate and respond to these developments our competitive position may weaken and our products or technologies might be uncompetitive or obsolete additionally a number of business combinations including mergers asset acquisitions and strategic partnerships in the semiconductor industry have occurred over the last several years and more could occur in the future consolidation in the industry could lead to fewer customers partners or suppliers any of which could negatively affect our financial results 

in recent years our business focus has expanded and now includes the design and production of platforms and other products for the data center internet of things and memory market segments including fpga products connectivity products and a number of other products and services for a wide range of connected devices as a result we face new sources of competition including in certain of these market segments from incumbent competitors with established customer bases and greater brand recognition to be successful we need to cultivate new industry relationships with customers and partners in these market segments in addition we must continually improve the cost integration and energy efficiency of our products as well as expand our software capabilities to provide customers with comprehensive computing solutions despite our ongoing efforts there is no guarantee that we will achieve or maintain consumer and market demand or acceptance for our products and services in these various market segments 

to compete successfully we must maintain a successful rd effort develop new products and production processes and improve our existing products and processes ahead of competitors for example we invest substantially in our network of manufacturing and assembly and test facilities including the construction of new fabrication facilities to support smaller transistor geometries and larger wafers our rd efforts are critical to our success and are aimed at solving complex problems and we do not expect all of our projects to be successful we may be unable to develop and market new products successfully and the products we invest in and develop may not be wellreceived by customers our rd investments may not generate significant operating income or contribute to our future operating results for several years and such contributions may not meet our expectations or even cover the costs of such investments additionally the products and technologies offered by others may affect demand for or pricing of our products 

if we are not able to compete effectively our financial results will be adversely affected including increased costs and reduced revenue and gross margin and we may be required to accelerate the writedown of the value of certain assets 

changes in the mix of products sold may harm our financial results our pricing and margins vary across our products and market segments due to differences in product features or manufacturing costs for example our platform product offerings range from lowerpriced and entrylevel platforms such as those based on intel quark or intel atom processors to higherend platforms based on intel xeon processors if demand shifts from our higherpriced to lowerpriced platforms in any of our market segments our gross margin and revenue would decrease in addition when products are introduced they tend to have higher costs because of initial development costs and lower production volumes relative to the previous product generation which can impact gross margin 

we operate globally and are subject to significant risks in many jurisdictions 

global or regional conditions may harm our financial results we have manufacturing assembly and test rd sales and other operations in many countries and some of our business activities may be concentrated in one or more geographic areas moreover sales outside the us accounted for approximately 78  of our revenue for the fiscal year ended december 31 2016  as a result our operations and our financial results including our ability to manufacture assemble and test design develop or sell products may be adversely affected by a number of factors outside of our control including 

 we are subject to laws and regulations worldwide which may differ among jurisdictions affecting our operations in areas including but not limited to ip ownership and infringement tax import and export requirements anticorruption foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy requirements anticompetition advertising employment product regulations environment health and safety requirements and consumer laws compliance with such requirements may be onerous and expensive and may otherwise impact our business operations negatively although we have policies controls and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws there can be no assurance that our employees contractors suppliers andor agents will not violate such laws or our policies violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation 

we may be affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in currency exchange rates although most of our sales occur in us dollars expenses may be paid in local currencies an increase in the value of the dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the us where we sell in dollars and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of expenses such as payroll utilities tax and marketing expenses as well as overseas capital expenditures we also conduct certain investing and financing activities in local currencies our hedging programs reduce but do not eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements therefore changes in exchange rates could harm our results of operations and financial condition 

catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results our operations or systems could be disrupted by natural disasters industrial accidents geopolitical conditions terrorist activity public health issues cybersecurity incidents interruptions of service from utilities transportation or telecommunications providers or other catastrophic events such events could make it difficult or impossible to manufacture or deliver products to our customers receive production materials from our suppliers or perform critical functions which could adversely affect our revenue and require significant recovery time and expenditures to resume operations while we maintain business recovery plans that are intended to enable us to recover from natural disasters or other events that can be disruptive to our business some of our systems are not fully redundant and we cannot be sure that our plans will fully protect us from all such disruptions 

we maintain a program of insurance coverage for a variety of property casualty and other risks the types and amounts of insurance we obtain vary depending on availability cost and decisions with respect to risk retention some of our policies have large deductibles and broad exclusions in addition one or more of our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim losses not covered by insurance may be large which could harm our results of operations and financial condition 

we are vulnerable to product and manufacturingrelated risks 

due to the variability in demand for our products and the complexity of our manufacturing operations we may be unable to timely respond to fluctuations in demand our operations have high costs that are either fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term including our costs related to manufacturing such as facility construction and equipment rd and the employment and training of a highly skilled workforce if product demand decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately we could be required to write off inventory or record excess capacity charges which would lower our gross margin our manufacturing or assembly and test capacity could be underutilized and we may be required to write down our longlived assets which would increase our expenses factoryplanning decisions may shorten the useful lives of facilities and equipment and cause us to accelerate depreciation 

conversely if product demand increases we may be unable to add capacity fast enough to meet market demand our revenue and gross margin can also be affected by the timing of our product introductions and related expenses including marketing expenses 

we are subject to risks associated with the development and implementation of new manufacturing process technology we may not be successful or efficient in developing or implementing new production processes production of integrated circuits is a complex process we are continually engaged in the transition from our existing process to the nextgeneration process technology this consistent innovation involves significant expense and carries inherent risks including difficulties in designing and developing nextgeneration process technologies development and production timing delays lower than anticipated manufacturing yields and product defects and errata disruptions in the production process can also result from errors defects in materials delays in obtaining or revising operating permits and licenses interruption in our supply of materials or resources and disruptions at our fabrication and assembly and test facilities due to accidents maintenance issues or unsafe working conditions—all of which could affect the timing of production ramps and yields production issues can lead to increased costs and may affect our ability to meet product demand which could adversely impact our business and the results from operations 

we face supply chain risks thousands of suppliers provide materials and equipment that we use in production and other aspects of our business where possible we seek to have several sources of supply for all of those materials however for certain materials we may rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers or upon suppliers in a single location in addition consolidation among suppliers could impact the nature quality availability and pricing of the products and services available to us the inability of suppliers to deliver adequate supplies of production materials or other supplies could disrupt our production processes or make it more difficult for us to implement our business strategy production could be disrupted by the unavailability of resources used in production such as water silicon electricity gases and other materials the unavailability or reduced availability of materials or resources may require us to reduce production or incur additional costs which could harm our business and results of operations our manufacturing operations and ability to meet product demand may also be impacted by ip or other litigation between our suppliers where an injunction against intel or a supplier could interrupt the availability of goods or services supplied to intel by others 

we also rely on thirdparty providers to manufacture and assemble and test certain components or products particularly those related to networking mobile and communications programmable semiconductor solutions and nand flash memory if any of these third parties are unable to perform these services on a timely or costeffective basis we may encounter supply delays or disruptions that could adversely affect our financial results 

in addition there are regulatory and other requirements restrictions and requests from various constituencies regarding sourcing practices and supplier conduct with a trend toward expanding the scope of materials and locations where materials originate regulating supplier behaviors and increasing the required disclosures regarding such matters by public companies increased regulation and public pressure in this area would cause our compliance costs to increase and could negatively affect our reputation given that we use many materials in the manufacturing of our products and rely on many suppliers to provide these materials but do not directly control their procurement or employment practices 

we are subject to the risks of product defects errata or other product issues product defects and errata deviations from published specifications may result from problems in our product design or our manufacturing and assembly and test processes components and products we purchase or license from thirdparty suppliers or attain through acquisitions may also contain defects we could face risks if products that we design manufacture or sell or that include our technology cause personal injury or property damage even where the cause is unrelated to product defects or errata these risks may increase as our products are introduced into new devices markets technologies or applications through the internet of things including wearables drones and transportation and industrial and consumer uses costs from defects errata or other product issues could include 

 these costs could be large and may increase expenses and lower gross margin and result in delay or loss of revenue any product defects errata or other issues could also damage our reputation negatively affect product demand delay product releases or result in legal liability the announcement of product defects or errata could cause customers to purchase products from competitors as a result of possible shortages of our components or for other reasons any of these occurrences could harm our business and financial results in addition although we maintain liability insurance our coverage has certain exclusions andor may not adequately cover liabilities incurred our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim and losses not covered by insurance could be large which could harm our financial condition 

we are subject to risks associated with environmental laws and regulations the manufacturing and assembly and test of our products require the use of hazardous materials that are subject to a broad array of environmental health and safety laws and regulations our failure to comply with these laws or regulations could result in 



our failure to manage the use transportation emissions discharge storage recycling or disposal of hazardous materials could lead to increased costs or future liabilities our ability to expand or modify our manufacturing capability in the future may be impeded by environmental regulations such as air quality and wastewater requirements environmental laws and regulations could also require us to acquire pollution abatement or remediation equipment modify product designs or incur other expenses many new materials that we are evaluating for use in our operations may be subject to regulation under environmental laws and regulations these restrictions could harm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter manufacturing and assembly and test processes 

climate change may also pose regulatory and environmental risks that could harm our results of operations and affect the way we conduct business for example climate change regulation could result in increased manufacturing costs associated with air pollution control requirements and increased or new monitoring recordkeeping and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions we also see the potential for higher energy costs driven by climate change regulations if for example utility companies pass on their costs to their customers furthermore many of our operations are located in semiarid regions that may become increasingly vulnerable to prolonged droughts due to climate change our fabrication facilities require significant water use and while we recycle and reuse a portion of the water used we may have difficulties obtaining sufficient water to fulfill our operational needs due the lack of available infrastructure 

we are subject to ip risks and risks associated with litigation and regulatory proceedings 

we may be unable to enforce or protect our ip rights we regard our patents copyrights trade secrets and other ip rights as important to the success of our business we rely on ip law as well as confidentiality and licensing agreements with our customers employees technology development partners and others to protect our ip rights our ability to enforce these rights is subject to general litigation risks as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our ip rights in various countries when we seek to enforce our rights we may be subject to claims that the ip rights are invalid not enforceable or licensed to the opposing party our assertion of ip rights may result in the other party seeking to assert claims against us which could harm our business governments may adopt regulations—and governments or courts may render decisions—requiring compulsory licensing of ip rights or governments may require products to meet standards that serve to favor local companies our inability to enforce our ip rights under any of these circumstances may harm our competitive position and business in addition the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products as a result the value of our investment in rd product development and marketing could be reduced 

our licenses with other companies and participation in industry initiatives may allow competitors to use our patent rights companies in our industry often bilaterally license patents between each other to settle disputes or as part of business agreements our competitors may have licenses to our patents and under current case law some of the licenses may exhaust our patent rights as to licensed product sales under some circumstances our participation in industry standards organizations or with other industry initiatives may require us to license our patents to companies that adopt industrystandard specifications depending on the rules of the organization we might have to grant these licenses to our patents for little or no cost and as a result we may be unable to enforce certain patents against others our costs of enforcing our licenses or protecting our patents may increase and the value of our ip rights may be impaired 

third parties may assert claims based on ip rights against us or our products which could harm our business we may face claims based on ip rights from individuals and companies including those who have acquired patent portfolios to assert claims against other companies we are normally engaged in a number of litigation matters involving ip rights claims that our products or processes infringe the ip rights of others whether or not meritorious could cause us to incur large costs to respond to defend and resolve and they may divert the efforts and attention of management and technical personnel in addition we may face claims based on the theft or unauthorized use or disclosure of thirdparty trade secrets and other confidential business information or enduser data that we obtain in conducting our business any such incidents and claims could severely disrupt our business and we could suffer losses including the cost of product recalls and returns and reputational harm furthermore we have agreed to indemnify customers for certain ip rights claims against them as a result of ip rights claims we could 

 these ip rights claims could harm our competitive position result in expenses or require us to impair our assets if we alter or stop production of affected items our revenue could be harmed 

we rely on access to thirdparty ip which may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all many of our products include thirdparty ip andor implement industry standards which may require licenses from third parties based on past experience and industry practice we believe such licenses generally can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms however there is no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all failure to obtain the right to use thirdparty ip or to use such ip on commercially reasonable terms could preclude us from selling certain products or otherwise have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results 

we are subject to the risks associated with litigation and regulatory proceedings we may face legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder consumer competition and other issues on a global basis as described in  note 20 commitments and contingencies  in part ii item 8 of this form 10k we are engaged in a number of litigation and regulatory matters litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain and adverse rulings could occur including monetary damages or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products engaging in certain business practices or requiring other remedies such as compulsory licensing of patents an unfavorable outcome may result in a material adverse impact on our business results of operations financial position and overall trends in addition regardless of the outcome litigation can be costly timeconsuming disruptive to our operations and distracting to management 

we must attract retain and motivate key employees 

to be competitive we must attract retain and motivate executives and other key employees hiring and retaining qualified executives scientists engineers technical staff and sales representatives are critical to our business and competition for experienced employees can be intense to help attract retain and motivate qualified employees we use sharebased and other performancebased incentive awards such as restricted stock units rsus and cash bonuses also key to our employee hiring and retention is our ability to build and maintain an inclusive business culture and be viewed as an employer of choice if our sharebased or other compensation programs and workplace culture cease to be viewed as competitive our ability to attract retain and motivate employees could be weakened which could harm our results of operations 

we are subject to cybersecurity and privacy risks 

third parties attempt to gain unauthorized access to our network products services and infrastructure we regularly face attempts by others to gain unauthorized access through the internet or to introduce malicious software to our information technology it systems additionally malicious hackers may attempt to gain unauthorized access and corrupt the processes of hardware and software products that we manufacture and services we provide due to the widespread use of our products and the high profile of our commercial security products we or our products and services are a frequent target of computer hackers and organizations that intend to sabotage take control of or otherwise corrupt our manufacturing or other processes products and services we are also a target of malicious attackers who attempt to gain access to our network or data centers or those of our customers or end users steal proprietary information related to our business products employees and customers or interrupt our systems and services or those of our customers or others we believe such attempts are increasing in number and in technical sophistication from time to time we encounter intrusions or unauthorized access to our network products services or infrastructure to date none have resulted in any material adverse impact to our business or operations in some instances we our customers and the users of our products and services might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects while we seek to detect and investigate all unauthorized attempts and attacks against our network products and services and to prevent their recurrence where practicable through changes to our internal processes and tools andor changes or patches to our products and services we remain potentially vulnerable to additional known or unknown threats such incidents whether successful or unsuccessful could result in our incurring significant costs related to for example rebuilding internal systems reduced inventory value providing modifications to our products and services defending against litigation responding to regulatory inquiries or actions paying damages or taking other remedial steps with respect to third parties in addition these threats are constantly evolving thereby increasing the difficulty of successfully defending against them or implementing adequate preventative measures publicity about vulnerabilities and attempted or successful incursions could damage our reputation with customers or users and reduce demand for our products and services 

we may be subject to theft loss or misuse of personal data about our employees customers or other third parties which could increase our expenses damage our reputation or result in legal or regulatory proceedings the theft loss or misuse of personal data collected used stored or transferred by us to run our business could result in significantly increased security costs or costs related to defending legal claims global privacy legislation enforcement and policy activity in this area are rapidly expanding and creating a complex regulatory compliance environment costs to comply with and implement these privacyrelated and data protection measures could be significant in addition even our inadvertent failure to comply with federal state or international privacyrelated or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others 

we are subject to risks associated with transactions 

we invest in companies for strategic reasons and may not realize a return on our investments we make investments in public and private companies around the world to further our strategic objectives and support key business initiatives many of the instruments in which we invest are nonmarketable at the time of our initial investment companies in which we invest range from earlystage companies still defining their strategic direction to mature companies with established revenue streams and business models the success of our investment in any company is typically dependent on the availability to the company of additional funding on favorable terms or a liquidity event such as a public offering or acquisition if any of the companies in which we invest fail we could lose all or part of our investment 

our acquisitions divestitures and other transactions could fail to achieve strategic objectives disrupt our ongoing business and harm our results of operations in pursuing   our business strategy we routinely conduct discussions evaluate opportunities and enter into agreements for possible acquisitions divestitures and other transactions such as joint ventures given that our resources are limited our decision to pursue a transaction has opportunity costs accordingly if we pursue a particular transaction we may need to forgo the prospect of entering into other transactions that could help us achieve our strategic objectives in addition to opportunity costs these transactions involve large challenges and risks including risks that 

 when we decide to sell assets or a business we may have difficulty selling on acceptable terms in a timely manner and the agreedupon terms and financing arrangements could be renegotiated due to changes in business or market conditions these circumstances could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives or cause us to incur additional expense or we may sell a business at a price or on terms that are less favorable than we had anticipated resulting in a loss on the transaction 

if we do enter into agreements with respect to acquisitions divestitures or other transactions we may fail to complete them due to factors such as 

 we are subject to salesrelated risks 

we face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties we sell a significant portion   of our products through third parties such as distributors valueadded resellers and channel partners collectively referred to as distributors as well as oems odms and internet service providers we depend on many distributors to help us create end customer demand provide technical support and other valueadded services to customers fill customer orders and stock our products we may rely on one or more key distributors for a product and a material change in our relationship with one or more of these distributors or their failure to perform as expected could reduce our revenue our ability to add or replace distributors for some of our products may be limited in addition our distributors expertise in the determination and stocking of acceptable inventory levels for some of our products may not be easily transferable to a new distributor as a result end customers may be hesitant to accept the addition or replacement of a distributor using third parties for distribution exposes us to many risks including competitive pressure concentration credit risk and compliance risks distributors and other third parties may sell products that compete with our products and we may need to provide financial and other incentives to focus them on the sale of our products they may face financial difficulties including bankruptcy which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and financial results violations of the foreign corrupt practices act or similar laws by distributors or other thirdparty intermediaries could have a material impact on our business failure to manage risks related to our use of distributors and other third parties may reduce sales increase expenses and weaken our competitive position 

we face risks related to business transactions with us government entities we receive proceeds from services and products we provide to the us government us government demand and payment may be affected by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations us government contracts are subject to oversight including special rules on accounting ip rights expenses reviews information handling and security failure to comply with these rules could result in civil and criminal penalties and sanctions including termination of contracts fines and suspensions or debarment from future us government business 

our results of operations could vary as a result of the methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying accounting policies 

the methods estimates and judgments used in applying accounting policies are subject to significant risks uncertainties assumptions and changes that could affect our financial position and results of operations for more information see critical accounting estimates in part ii item 7 and note 2 accounting policies in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

changes in our effective tax rate may reduce our net income 

a number of factors may increase our effective tax rates which could reduce our net income including 

 we may have fluctuations in the amount and frequency of our stock repurchases 

the amount timing and execution of our stock repurchase program may fluctuate based on our priorities for the use of cash for other purposes—such as investing in our business including operational spending capital spending and acquisitions and returning cash to our stockholders as dividend payments—and because of changes in cash flows and changes in tax laws 

workforce restructuring actions may be disruptive to our operations and adversely affect our financial results 

in response to the business environment and to accomplish our strategic objectives we have announced restructurings of our operations and have made other adjustments to our workforce we may pursue similar actions in the future and such workforce changes can result in restructuring charges in addition to those described in  note 7 restructuring and other charges  in part ii item 8 of this form 10k any such workforce changes can also temporarily reduce workforce productivity which could be disruptive to our business and adversely affect our results of operations in addition if our restructurings are perceived negatively our corporate reputation and ability to attract employees could suffer moreover we may not achieve or sustain the expected cost savings or other benefits of our restructuring plans or do so within the expected time frame 

additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations with regard to our restructuring activity include 



there are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of our controls 

we do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how welldesigned and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met the design of a control system must reflect the fact that resource constraints exist and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks over time controls may become inadequate due to changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures if our controls become inadequate we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations our reputation may be adversely affected our business and operating results could be harmed and the market price of our stock could decline

operating results   



the operating loss for the psg operating segment was driven by acquisitionrelated charges primarily deferred revenue writedown and inventory valuation adjustment due to the revaluation of deferred revenue to fair value we excluded revenue of 99 million  and associated costs that would have created 64 million  of operating income in 2016  additionally we incurred approximately 387 million  of additional cost of sales charges during the period that would have been excluded from the operating results in 2016  if the acquired inventory had not been remeasured to fair value upon acquisition and then sold to end customers resulting in zero margin on that inventory for the period 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

operating expenses 



research and development 

rd spending increased  by 612 million  or 5  in 2016  compared to 2015  the increase  was driven by the addition of psg expenses from the acquisition of altera higher investment net of 2016 restructuring program savings in strategically important areas such as servers internet of things new devices and memory as well as higher process development costs for our new 7nm process technology these increases were partially offset by lower depreciation expense due to a change at the beginning of fiscal year 2016 to the estimated useful life of our machinery and equipment in our wafer fabrication facilities 

rd spending increased  by 591 million  or 5  in 2015  compared to 2014  the increase  was due to higher investment in our products—primarily server internet of things and new devices—as well as expenses of newly acquired entities and higher process development costs for our 10nm process technology this increase  was partially offset by lower profitdependent compensation and savings from the implementation of efficiencies within our ccg operating segment 

marketing general and administrative 

mga expenses increased  by 467 million  or 6  in 2016  compared to 2015  this increase was primarily due to psg expenses from the acquisition of altera

restructuring and other charges 



2016 restructuring program  in q2 2016 our management approved and commenced the 2016 restructuring program to accelerate our transformation from a pc company to one that powers the cloud and billions of smart connected computing devices under this program we are in the process of closing certain facilities and reducing headcount globally to align our operations with evolving business needs by investing in our growth businesses and improving efficiencies we expect these actions to be substantially completed by q2 2017 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

restructuring actions related to this program that were approved in 2016 are expected to impact approximately   15000   employees  we estimate that the charges incurred to date as part of the 2016 restructuring program will result in net annual headcount savings of approximately 16 billion  as we rebalance our workforce on an annual basis we expect 14 billion  of these savings will reduce our rd and mga spending and the remainder will reduce our cost of sales we began to realize these savings in q2 2016 and expect to fully realize these savings by q2 2017  we are reallocating these savings to our growth segments such as the data center and internet of things and are continuing to invest in areas that extend our leadership in moores law and expand market opportunities in areas such as memory and autonomous driving 

for further information on the 2016 restructuring program see  note 7 restructuring and other charges  in part ii item 8 of this form 10k

we recognized higher net gains on equity investments in 2016  compared to 2015  primarily due to gains of 407 million  related to sales of a portion of our interest in asml 

we recognized lower net gains on equity investments in 2015  compared to 2014  due to lower gains on sales of equity investments partially offset by higher gains on thirdparty merger transactions 

we recognized a higher interest and other net loss in 2016  compared to 2015  primarily due to higher interest expense from debt issued or acquired in 2015 and 2016 as well as lower capitalized interest due to lower eligible capital expenditures in 2016 

we recognized an interest and other net loss in 2015  compared to a net gain in 2014  primarily due to higher interest expense which resulted from the issuance of senior unsecured notes during 2015 for further information on these transactions see  note 14 borrowings  in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

provision for taxes 



the majority of the increase  in our effective tax rate in 2016  compared to 2015  was driven by onetime items and our 2015 decision to indefinitely reinvest some of our prior years nonus earnings partially offset by higher proportion of our income in lower tax jurisdictions 

most of the decrease  in our effective tax rate in 2015  compared to 2014  was driven by onetime items a higher proportion of our income from lower tax jurisdictions and our decision to indefinitely reinvest certain prior years nonus earnings which positively impacted our effective income tax rate   

liquidity and capital resources 

we consider the following when assessing our liquidity and capital resources 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

sources and uses of cash 

in millions 

in summary our cash flows for each period were as follows 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

operating activities 

cash provided by  operating activities is net income adjusted for certain noncash items and changes in assets and liabilities 

for 2016  compared to 2015  the 28 billion   increase  in cash provided by operating activities was due to adjustments for noncash items and changes in working capital partially offset by lower net income the adjustments for noncash items were higher in 2016 primarily due to restructuring and other charges and the change in deferred taxes partially offset by lower depreciation expense income taxes paid net of refunds in 2016  compared to 2015 were 26 billion   lower due to bonus depreciation on capital assets placed in service as well as timing of certain tax payments and refunds 

for 2015  compared to 2014  the 14 billion   decrease  in cash provided by operating activities was due to changes in working capital adjustments for noncash items and lower net income the adjustments for noncash items were lower due primarily to deferred taxes partially offset by higher depreciation 

investing activities 

investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures investment purchases sales maturities and disposals and proceeds from divestitures and cash used for acquisitions our capital expenditures were 96 billion  in 2016   73 billion  in 2015  and 101 billion  in 2014  

the increase  in cash used for investing activities in 2016  compared to 2015  was primarily due to our completed acquisition of altera net purchases of trading assets in 2016  compared to net sales of trading assets in 2015  and higher capital expenditures in 2016 this increase was partially offset by lower investments in nonmarketable equity investments and collection of loans receivable and reverse repurchase agreements 

the decrease  in cash used for investing activities in 2015  compared to 2014  was primarily due to cash generated by net trading asset activity and lower capital expenditures during 2015  this activity was partially offset by net availableforsale activity which was cash flow neutral in 2015  compared to a source of cash in 2014  and higher investments in nonmarketable equity investments during 2015  

financing activities 

financing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases of common stock payment of dividends to stockholders issuance and repayment of shortterm and longterm debt and proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock through employee equity incentive plans 

cash was used for  financing activities in 2016  compared to cash provided by financing activities in 2015  primarily due to lower proceeds from debt issuances and the repayment of 15 billion  of debt in 2016 these amounts were partially offset by repayment of commercial paper in 2015  and fewer repurchases of common stock under our authorized stock repurchase program we have an ongoing authorization originally approved by our board of directors in 2005 and subsequently amended to repurchase up to   650 billion  in shares of our common stock in the open market or negotiated transactions during 2016  we repurchased 26 billion  of common stock under our authorized common stock repurchase program compared to 30 billion  in 2015  as of december 31 2016  68 billion  remained available for repurchasing common stock under the existing repurchase authorization limit we base our level of common stock repurchases on internal cash management decisions and this level may fluctuate proceeds from the sale of common stock through employee equity incentive plans totaled 11 billion  in 2016  compared to 866 million  in 2015  our total dividend payments were 49 billion  in 2016  compared to 46 billion  in 2015  we have paid a cash dividend in each of the past 97  quarters in january 2017  our board of directors declared a cash dividend of 026  per share of common stock for q1 2017  the dividend is payable on march 1 2017  to stockholders of record on february 7 2017  

cash was provided by financing activities in 2015  compared to cash used by financing activities in 2014  primarily due to the issuance of longterm debt in 2015  and fewer repurchases of common stock under our authorized stock repurchase program in 2015  compared to 2014  this activity was partially offset by lower proceeds from the sales of common stock in 2015  and repayments of shortterm debt in 2015  compared to borrowings in 2014  

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

liquidity 

cash generated by operations is our primary source of liquidity we maintain a diverse investment portfolio that we continually analyze based on issuer industry and country when assessing our sources of liquidity we include investments as shown in the liquidity and capital resources table substantially all  of our investments in debt instruments and financing receivables are in investmentgrade securities 

other potential sources of liquidity include our commercial paper program and our automatic shelf registration statement on file with the sec pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt equity and other securities under our commercial paper program we have an ongoing authorization from our board of directors to borrow up to 50 billion  no  commercial paper remained outstanding as of december 31 2016  on december 21 2015 we entered into a shortterm credit facility to borrow up to 50 billion  to facilitate the settlement of our acquisition of altera under this credit facility we borrowed 40 billion  and the facility was closed in january 2016 in q2 2016 we issued 28 billion  aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes to refinance existing indebtedness including our 195  senior notes due 2016  and a portion of our 135  senior notes due 2017  

as of december 31 2016  136 billion  of our 171 billion  of cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and trading assets was held by our nonus subsidiaries of the 136 billion  held by our nonus subsidiaries approximately 15 billion  was available for use in the us without incurring additional us income taxes in excess of the amounts already accrued in our financial statements as of december 31 2016  the remaining amount of nonus cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and trading assets has been indefinitely reinvested and therefore no us current or deferred taxes have been accrued this amount is earmarked for nearterm investment in our operations outside the us and future acquisitions of nonus entities we believe our us sources of cash and liquidity are sufficient to meet our business needs in the us and do not expect that we will need to repatriate the funds we have designated as indefinitely reinvested outside the us under current tax laws should our plans change and we were to choose to repatriate some or all of the funds we have designated as indefinitely reinvested outside the us such amounts would be subject to us income taxes and applicable nonus income and withholding taxes 

we believe we have sufficient financial resources to meet our business requirements in the next 12 months including capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test working capital requirements and potential dividends common stock repurchases acquisitions and strategic investments

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend we are affected by changes in currency exchange and interest rates as well as equity and commodity prices our risk management programs reduce but may not entirely eliminate the impact of these risks all of the following potential changes are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial positions as of december 31 2016  and december 26 2015  actual results may differ materially 

currency exchange rates 

we are exposed to currency exchange risks of nonusdollardenominated investments in debt instruments and loans receivable and may economically hedge this risk with foreign currency contracts such as currency forward contracts or currency interest rate swaps gains or losses on these nonuscurrency investments are generally offset by corresponding losses or gains on the related hedging instruments we are exposed to currency exchange risks from our nonusdollardenominated debt indebtedness and may use foreign currency contracts designated as cash flow hedges to manage this risk 

substantially all  of our revenue is transacted in us dollars however a significant  portion of our operating expenditures and capital purchases are incurred in other currencies primarily the euro the japanese yen the israeli shekel and the chinese yuan  we have established currency risk management programs to protect against currency exchange rate risks associated with nonus dollar forecasted future cash flows and existing nonus dollar monetary assets and liabilities we may also hedge currency risk arising from funding of foreign currencydenominated future investments we may utilize foreign currency contracts such as currency forward or option contracts in these hedging programs we considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that a weighted average adverse change of 20  in currency exchange rates could be experienced in the near term such an adverse change after taking into account balance sheet hedges only and offsetting recorded monetary asset and liability positions would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before taxes of less than 80 million  as of december 31 2016  less than 75 million  as of december 26 2015  

interest rates 

we are exposed to interest rate risk related to our fixedrate investment portfolio and outstanding debt the primary objective of our investment policy is to preserve principal and the financial flexibility to fund our business while maximizing yields which generally track the us dollar threemonth libor we generally enter into interest rate contracts to convert the returns on our fixedrate debt investment with remaining maturities longer than six months into us dollar threemonth liborbased returns we may enter into swaps to convert fixedrate coupon payments into floatingrate coupon payments for our existing indebtedness gains or losses on these instruments are generally offset by corresponding losses or gains on the related hedging instruments 

a hypothetical decrease in benchmark interest rates of up to 10  after taking into account investment hedges would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our investment portfolio of approximately 100 million  as of december 31 2016  an increase of approximately 15 million  as of december 26 2015  after taking into account interest rate and currency swaps a hypothetical decrease in interest rates of up to 10  would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our indebtedness of approximately 13 billion  as of december 31 2016  an increase of approximately 16 billion  as of december 26 2015  the fluctuations in fair value of our investment portfolio and indebtedness reflect only the direct impact of the change in interest rates other economic variables such as equity market fluctuations and changes in relative credit risk could result in a significantly higher fluctuation in the fair value of our net investment position 

equity prices 

our investments include marketable equity securities and equity derivative instruments we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our equity market exposure through hedging activities at the inception of our investments before we enter into hedge arrangements we evaluate legal market and economic factors as well as the expected timing of disposal to determine whether hedging is appropriate our equity market risk management program may include equity derivatives with or without hedge accounting designation that utilize warrants equity options or other equity derivatives 

we also utilize total return swaps to offset changes in liabilities related to the equity market risks of certain deferred compensation arrangements gains or losses from changes in fair value of these total return swaps are generally offset by the losses or gains on the related liabilities 

as of december 31 2016  the fair value of our marketable equity investments and our equity derivative instruments including hedging positions was 62 billion   60 billion  as of december 26 2015  substantially all  of our marketable equity investments portfolio as of december 31 2016  was concentrated in our investment in asml of 61 billion   57 billion  as of december 26 2015  our marketable equity method investments are excluded from our analysis as the carrying value does not fluctuate based on market price changes unless an otherthantemporary impairment is deemed necessary to determine reasonably possible decreases in the market value of our marketable equity investments we have analyzed the historical market price sensitivity of our marketable equity investment portfolio assuming a decline of 30  in market prices and after reflecting the impact of hedges and offsetting positions the aggregate value of our marketable equity investments could decrease by approximately 19 billion  based on the value as of december 31 2016  a decrease in value of approximately 18 billion  based on the value as of december 26 2015  using an assumed decline of 30  

many of the same factors that could result in an adverse movement of equity market prices affect our nonmarketable equity investments although we cannot always quantify the impact directly financial markets are volatile which could negatively affect the prospects of the companies we invest in their ability to raise additional capital and the likelihood of our ability to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings mergers and private sales these types of investments involve a great deal of risk and there can be no assurance that any specific company will grow or become successful consequently we could lose all or part of our investment our nonmarketable cost method equity investments had a carrying amount of 31 billion  as of december 31 2016   29 billion  as of december 26 2015  and included our investment in unispreadtrum and cloudera inc cloudera of 966 million  and 454 million  respectively  966 million  and 454 million  for unispreadtrum and cloudera respectively as of december 26 2015  the carrying amount of our nonmarketable equity method investments was 13 billion  as of december 31 2016   16 billion  as of december 26 2015  a substantial majority  of our nonmarketable equity method investments balance as of december 31 2016  was concentrated in our imft and cloudera investments of 849 million  and 225 million  respectively  872 million  and 256 million  for imft and cloudera respectively as of december 26 2015  

commodity price risk 

although we operate facilities that consume commodities we are not directly affected by commodity price risk to a material degree we have established forecasted transaction risk management programs to protect against fluctuations in commodity prices we may use commodity derivatives contracts such as commodity swaps in these hedging programs in addition we have sourcing plans in place for our key commodities that mitigate the risk of a potential supplier concentration

competition 

the computing industry continuously evolves with new and enhanced technologies and products from existing and new providers the marketplace can change quickly in response to the introduction of such technologies and products and other factors such as changes in customer and enduser requirements expectations and preferences as technologies evolve and new market segments emerge the boundaries between the market segments that we compete in are also subject to change 

intel faces significant competition in the development and market acceptance of our products in this environment our platforms based on intel architecture are positioned to compete across the compute continuum from the lowest power and mobile devices to the most powerful data center servers our platforms which have integrated hardware and software offer customers benefits such as ease of use savings in total cost of ownership and the ability to scale systems to accommodate increased usage 

competitors 

we compete against other companies that make and sell platforms other silicon components and software to businesses that build and sell computing and communications devices to end users our competitors also include companies that sell goods and services to businesses that use them for their internal andor customerfacing processes eg businesses running large data centers in addition we face competition from oems odms and other industrial and communications equipment manufacturers that to some degree choose to vertically integrate their own proprietary semiconductor and software assets by doing so these competitors may be attempting to offer greater differentiation in their products and to increase their share of the profits for each finished product they sell continuing changes in industry participants through for example acquisitions or business collaborations could also have a significant impact on our competitive position 

in the pc market segment we are a leading provider of platforms for traditional desktops and notebooks we face existing and emerging competition in these product areas tablets phones and other mobile devices offered by numerous vendors are significant competitors to traditional pcs for many usages we are relatively recent providers of platforms for tablets and phones and face strong competition from vendors that use applications processors based on the arm architecture feature lowpower long batterylife operation and are built in soc formats that integrate numerous functions on one chip 

in the data center market segment we are a leading provider of data center platforms and face competition from companies using arm architecture or other technologies internet cloud computing storage and networking are areas of significant targeted growth for us in the data center segment and we face strong competition in these market segments 

in the internet of things market segment we have a longstanding position as a supplier of components and software for embedded products this marketplace continues to significantly expand with increasing types and numbers of smart and connected devices for industrial commercial and consumer uses such as wearables as this market segment evolves we face numerous large and small incumbent competitors as well as new entrants that use arm architecture and other operating systems and software 

our security business operates in highly competitive fragmented and rapidly changing market segments we are a major provider of cybersecurity products and services to both businesses and consumers for businesses we compete with companies selling individual point security products and companies selling multiple security products we offer to businesses a portfolio of products that are integrated into a comprehensive security solution for consumers we primarily compete against other major security companies and providers of free security products our consumer offerings are designed to protect user data identity and devices across the compute continuum 

in the memory market segment we compete against other providers of nand flash memory products we focus our efforts primarily on incorporating nand flash memory into solution products such as solidstate drives supporting consumer and enterprise applications we believe that our memory offerings including innovative developments such as 3d xpoint technology will complement our other product offerings in our other segments 

our products primarily compete based on performance energy efficiency integration innovative design features price quality reliability brand recognition technical support and availability the importance of these factors varies by the type of end system for the products for example performance might be among the most important factors for our products for data center servers while price and integration might be among the most important factors for our products for tablets phones and other mobile devices 

competitive advantages 

our key competitive advantages include 

 manufacturing and assembly and test 

as of december 26 2015  55  of our wafer fabrication including microprocessors and chipsets was conducted within the us at our facilities in arizona oregon and new mexico  our massachusetts fabrication facility was our last manufacturing facility on 200 millimeter mm  wafers and ceased production in q1 2015  the remaining 45  of our wafer fabrication was conducted outside the us at our facilities in ireland israel and china our fabrication facility in ireland has transitioned to our 14nm process technology with manufacturing continuing to ramp in 2016  wafer fabrication conducted within and outside the us may be impacted by the timing of a facility’s transition to a newer process technology as well as a facility’s capacity utilization 

as of december 26 2015  we manufactured our products in wafer fabrication facilities at the following locations 

as of december 26 2015  our microprocessors were manufactured on 300mm wafers with a substantial majority  manufactured using our 14nm 22nm and 32nm process technologies as we move to each succeeding generation of manufacturing process technology we incur significant startup costs to prepare each factory for manufacturing however continuing to advance our process technology provides benefits that we believe justify these costs the benefits of moving to each succeeding generation of manufacturing process technology can include using less space per transistor reducing heat output from each transistor and increasing the number of integrated features on each chip these advancements can enable us to introduce new devices with higher functionality and complexity while controlling power cost and size  in addition with each shift to a new process technology we are able to produce more microprocessors per square foot of our wafer fabrication facilities the costs to develop newer process technologies are significantly less than adding capacity by building additional wafer fabrication facilities using older process technologies 

we use thirdparty foundries to manufacture wafers for certain components including communications connectivity and networking products for example the intel atom x3 processor is fabricated by a thirdparty foundry in addition we primarily use subcontractors to manufacture boardlevel products and systems we purchase certain communications and connectivity products from external vendors primarily in the asiapacific region 

following the manufacturing process the majority of our components are subject to assembly and test we perform our components assembly and test at facilities in malaysia china and vietnam  to augment capacity we use subcontractors to perform assembly and test of certain products primarily chipsets and communications and connectivity products 

our nand flash memory products are manufactured by imft and micron using 20nm or 25nm process technology and assembly and test of these products is performed by micron and other external subcontractors for further information see  note 5 cash and investments  in part ii item 8 of this form 10k additionally in the second half of 2016 we will start using our facility in dalian china to help expand our manufacturing capacity in nextgeneration memory  the expansion is part of our multisource supply strategy and will allow us to best serve our customers 

our employment and operating practices are consistent with and we expect our suppliers and subcontractors to abide by local country law intel expects all suppliers to comply with our code of conduct and the electronic industry citizenship coalition eicc code of conduct both of which set standards that address the rights of workers to safe and healthy working conditions environmental responsibility compliance with privacy and data security obligations and compliance with applicable laws 

we have thousands of suppliers including subcontractors providing our various materials equipment and service needs we set expectations for supplier performance and reinforce those expectations with periodic assessments and audits we communicate those expectations to our suppliers regularly and work with them to implement improvements when necessary where possible we seek to have several sources of supply for all of these materials and resources but we may rely on a single or limited number of suppliers or upon suppliers in a single country in those cases we develop and implement plans and actions to reduce the exposure that would result from a disruption in supply we have entered into longterm contracts with certain suppliers to help ensure a stable supply of silicon and semiconductor manufacturing tools 

our products are typically manufactured at multiple intel facilities around the world or by subcontractors however some products are manufactured in only one intel or subcontractor facility and we seek to implement action plans to reduce the exposure that would result from a disruption at any such facility see risk factors in part i item 1a of this form 10k

our rd model is based on a global organization that emphasizes a collaborative approach to identifying and developing new technologies leading standards initiatives and influencing regulatory policies to accelerate the adoption of new technologies including joint pathfinding conducted between researchers at intel labs and our business groups we centrally manage key crossbusiness group product initiatives to align and prioritize our rd activities across these groups in addition we may augment our rd activities by investing in companies or entering into agreements with companies that have similar rd focus areas as well as directly purchasing or licensing technology applicable to our rd initiatives to drive innovation and gain efficiencies we intend to utilize our investments in intellectual property and rd across our market segments 

employees 

as of december 26 2015  we had 107300  employees worldwide with approximately 51  of those employees located in the us 

sales and marketing 

customers 

we sell our products primarily to oems and odms odms provide design and manufacturing services to branded and unbranded privatelabel resellers in addition we sell our products to other manufacturers including makers of a wide range of industrial and communications equipment our customers also include those who buy pc components and our other products through distributor reseller retail and oem channels throughout the world 

our worldwide reseller sales channel consists of thousands of indirect customers—systems builders that purchase intel ®  microprocessors and other products from our distributors we have a program that allows distributors to sell our microprocessors and other products in small quantities to customers of systems builders our microprocessors and other products are also available in direct retail outlets 

hewlettpackard company our largest customer in 2014 separated into hp inc and hewlett packard enterprise company on november 1 2015 in 2015 these entities collectively accounted for 18  of our net revenue  18  in 2014  and 17  in 2013  dell inc accounted for 15  of our net revenue  16  in 2014  and 15  in 2013  and lenovo group limited accounted for 13  of our net revenue  12  in 2014  and 12  in 2013  no other customer accounted for more than 10 of our net revenue during such periods for information about net revenue and operating income by operating segment and net revenue from unaffiliated customers by country see  note 26 operating segments and geographic information  in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

sales arrangements 

our products are sold through sales offices throughout the world sales of our products are frequently made via purchase order acknowledgments that contain standard terms and conditions covering matters such as pricing payment terms and warranties as well as indemnities for issues specific to our products such as patent and copyright indemnities from time to time we may enter into additional agreements with customers covering for example changes from our standard terms and conditions new product development and marketing privatelabel branding and other matters our sales are routinely made using electronic and webbased processes that allow the customer to review inventory availability and track the progress of specific goods ordered pricing on particular products may vary based on volumes ordered and other factors we also offer discounts rebates and other incentives to customers to increase acceptance of our products and technology 

our products are generally shipped under terms that transfer title to the customer even in arrangements for which the recognition of revenue and related cost of sales is deferred our standard terms and conditions of sale typically provide that payment is due at a later date usually 30 days after shipment or delivery we assess credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis from this analysis we establish shipping and credit limits and determine whether we will seek to use one or more credit support protection devices such as obtaining a parent guarantee standby letter of credit or credit insurance  credit losses may still be incurred due to bankruptcy fraud or other failure of the customer to pay for information about our allowance for doubtful receivables see schedule ii—valuation and qualifying accounts in part iv of this form 10k 

our sales to distributors are typically made under agreements allowing for price protection on unsold merchandise and a right of return on stipulated quantities of unsold merchandise under the price protection program we give distributors credits for the difference between the original price paid and the current price that we offer our products typically have no contractual limit on the amount of price protection nor is there a limit on the time horizon under which price protection is granted the right of return granted generally consists of a stock rotation program in which distributors are able to exchange certain products based on the number of qualified purchases made by the distributor we have the option to grant credit for repair or replace defective products and there is no contractual limit on the amount of credit that may be granted to a distributor for defective products 

distribution 

distributors typically handle a wide variety of products including those that compete with our products and fill orders for many customers customers may place orders directly with us or through distributors we have several distribution warehouses that are located in proximity to key customers 

backlog 

over time our larger customers have generally moved to leaninventory or justintime operations rather than maintaining larger inventories of our products as our customers continue to lower their inventories our processes to fulfill their orders have evolved to meet their needs as a result our manufacturing production is based on estimates and advance nonbinding commitments from customers as to future purchases our order backlog as of any particular date is a mix of these commitments and specific firm orders that are primarily made pursuant to standard purchase orders for delivery of products only a small portion of our orders are noncancelable and the dollar amount associated with the noncancelable portion is not significant 

seasonal trends 

historically our net revenue has typically been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year accelerating in the third quarter and peaking in the fourth quarter 

marketing 

our global marketing objectives are to build a strong wellknown intel corporate brand that connects with businesses and consumers and to offer a limited number of meaningful and valuable brands in our portfolio to aid businesses and consumers in making informed choices about technology purchases the intel core processor family and the intel quark intel atom intel ®  celeron ®  intel ®  pentium ®  intel xeon intel xeon phi and intel ®  itanium ®  trademarks make up our processor brands 

we promote brand awareness and preference and generate demand through our own direct marketing as well as through comarketing programs our direct marketing activities primarily include advertising through digital and social media and television as well as consumer and trade events industry and consumer communications and press relations we market to consumer and business audiences and focus on building awareness and generating demand for new form factors such as tablets allinone devices and 2 in 1 systems powered by intel our key messaging focuses on increased performance improved energy efficiency and other capabilities such as connectivity communications and security 

purchases by customers often allow them to participate in cooperative advertising and marketing programs such as the intel inside ®  program this program broadens the reach of our brands beyond the scope of our own direct marketing through the intel inside program certain customers are licensed to place intel ®  logos on computing devices containing our microprocessors and processor technologies and to use our brands in their marketing activities the program includes a market development component that accrues funds based on purchases and partially reimburses customers for marketing activities for products featuring intel ®  brands subject to customers meeting defined criteria these marketing activities primarily include advertising through digital and social media and television as well as press relations we have also entered into joint marketing arrangements with certain customers 

intellectual property rights and licensing 

intel owns significant intellectual property ip and related ip rights around the world that relate to our products services rd and other activities and assets our ip portfolio includes patents copyrights trade secrets trademarks trade dress rights and maskwork rights we actively seek to protect our global ip rights and to deter unauthorized use of our ip and other assets such efforts can be difficult however particularly in countries that provide less protection to ip rights and in the absence of harmonized international ip standards while our ip rights are important to our success our business as a whole is not significantly dependent on any single patent copyright or other ip right see risk factors in part i item 1a and  note 25 contingencies  in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

we have obtained patents in the us and other countries because of the fast pace of innovation and product development and the comparative pace of governments’ patenting processes our products are often obsolete before the patents related to them expire in some cases our products may be obsolete before the patents related to them are granted as we expand our products into new industries we also seek to extend our patent development efforts to patent such products in addition to developing patents based on our own rd efforts we purchase patents from third parties to supplement our patent portfolio established competitors in existing and new industries as well as companies that purchase and enforce patents and other ip may already have patents covering similar products there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain patents covering our own products or that we will be able to obtain licenses from other companies on favorable terms or at all 

the software that we distribute including software embedded in our componentlevel and platform products is entitled to copyright and other ip protection to distinguish our products from our competitors’ products we have obtained trademarks and trade names for our products and we maintain cooperative advertising programs with customers to promote our brands and to identify products containing genuine intel components we also protect details about our processes products and strategies as trade secrets keeping confidential the information that we believe provides us with a competitive advantage 

compliance with environmental health and safety regulations 

our compliance efforts focus on monitoring regulatory and resource trends and setting companywide performance targets for key resources and emissions these targets address several parameters including product design chemical energy and water use waste recycling the source of certain minerals used in our products climate change and emissions 

as a company we focus on reducing natural resource use the solid and chemical waste byproducts of our manufacturing processes and the environmental impact of our products we currently use a variety of materials in our manufacturing process that have the potential to adversely impact the environment and are subject to a variety of environmental health and safety ehs laws and regulations over the past several years we have significantly reduced the use of lead and halogenated flame retardants in our products and manufacturing processes 

we work with nongovernmental organizations ngos oems and retailers to help manage ewaste including electronic products nearing the end of their useful lives and to promote recycling the european union requires producers of certain electrical and electronic equipment to develop programs that let consumers return products for recycling many us states and countries in latin america and asia also have or are developing similar ewaste takeback laws although these laws are typically targeted at the end electronic product and not components such as microprocessors the inconsistency of many ewaste takeback laws changes in our product offerings and the lack of local ewaste management options in many areas pose a challenge for our compliance efforts 

we are an industry leader in our efforts to build ethical sourcing of minerals for our products including conflict minerals from the drc and adjoining countries in 2013 we accomplished our goal to manufacture microprocessors that are drc conflictfree for tantalum tin tungsten and gold we continue our work to establish drc conflictfree supply chains for our company and our industry and are moving beyond microprocessors to validate our broader product base as drc conflictfree in 2016 for these four minerals 

we seek to reduce our global greenhouse gas emissions by investing in energy conservation projects in our factories and working with suppliers to improve energy efficiency we take a holistic approach to power management addressing the challenge at the silicon package circuit microarchitecture macroarchitecture platform and software levels we recognize that climate change may cause general economic risk for further information on the risks of climate change see risk factors in part i item 1a of this form 10k we see a potential for higher energy costs driven by climate change regulations this could include items applied to utility companies that are passed along to customers such as carbon taxes or costs associated with obtaining permits for our manufacturing operations emission cap and trade programs or renewable portfolio standards 

we are committed to sustainability and take a leadership position in promoting voluntary environmental initiatives and working proactively with governments environmental groups and industry to promote global environmental sustainability we believe that technology will be fundamental to finding solutions to the world’s environmental challenges and we are joining forces with industry business and governments to find and promote ways that technology can be used as a tool to combat climate change 

we have been purchasing renewable energy at some of our major sites for several years we purchase renewable energy certificates under a multiyear contract this purchase has placed intel at the top of the us environmental protection agency green power partnership rankings for the past eight years and is intended to help stimulate the market for green power leading to additional generating capacity and ultimately lower costs 

distribution of company information 

our internet address is wwwintelcom  we publish voluntary reports on our website that outline our performance with respect to corporate responsibility including ehs compliance 

we use our investor relations website wwwintccom   as a routine channel for distribution of important information including news releases analyst presentations and financial information we post filings on our website the same day they are electronically filed with or furnished to the us securities and exchange commission sec including our annual and quarterly reports on forms 10k and 10q and current reports on form 8k our proxy statements and any amendments to those reports or statements we post our quarterly and annual earnings results at wwwintccomresultscfm  and do not distribute our financial results via a news wire service all such postings and filings are available on our investor relations website free of charge in addition our investor relations website allows interested persons to sign up to automatically receive email alerts when we post financial information the sec’s website wwwsecgov   contains reports proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the sec the content on any website referred to in this form 10k is not incorporated by reference in this form 10k unless expressly noted

risk factors 

tableend the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our common stock could decline these risk factors do not identify all risks that we face our operations could also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations due to risks and uncertainties known and unknown our past financial results may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods you should also refer to the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k including management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and our financial statements and the related notes 

changes in product demand can harm our results of operation and financial condition 

demand for our products is variable and hard to predict changes   in the demand for our products may reduce our revenue increase our costs lower our gross margin percentage or require us to write down the value of our assets important factors that could lead to variation in the demand for our products include changes in 

 we face significant competition the   industry in which we operate is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological and market developments changes in industry standards changes in customer needs and frequent product introductions and improvements if we do not anticipate and respond to these developments our competitive position may weaken and our products or technologies might be uncompetitive or obsolete in recent years our business focus has expanded and now includes the design and production of platforms for tablets phones and other devices across the compute continuum including products for the internet of things and related services as a result we face new sources of competition including in certain of these market segments from incumbent competitors with established customer bases and greater brand recognition to be successful we need to cultivate new industry relationships with customers and partners in these market segments in addition we must continually improve the cost integration and energy efficiency of our products as well as expand our software capabilities to provide customers with comprehensive computing solutions despite our ongoing efforts there is no guarantee that we will achieve or maintain consumer and market demand or acceptance for our products and services in these various market segments 

to compete successfully we must maintain a successful rd effort develop new products and production processes and improve our existing products and processes ahead of competitors for example we invest substantially in our network of manufacturing and assembly and test facilities including the construction of new fabrication facilities to support smaller transistor geometries and larger wafers our rd efforts are critical to our success and are aimed at solving complex problems and we do not expect all of our projects to be successful we may be unable to develop and market new products successfully and the products we invest in and develop may not be wellreceived by customers our rd investments may not generate significant operating income or contribute to our future operating results for several years and such contributions may not meet our expectations or even cover the costs of such investments additionally the products and technologies offered by others may affect demand for or pricing of our products 

if we are not able to compete effectively our financial results will be adversely affected including increased costs and reduced revenue and gross margin and we may be required to accelerate the writedown of the value of certain assets 

changes in the mix of products sold may harm our financial results prices differ widely among the platforms we offer in our various market segments due to differences in features offered or manufacturing costs for example product offerings range from lowerpriced and entrylevel platforms such as those based on intel quark or intel atom processors to higherend platforms based on intel xeon and intel itanium processors if demand shifts from our higherpriced to lowerpriced platforms in any of our market segments our gross margin and revenue would decrease in addition when products are introduced they tend to have higher costs because of initial development costs and lower production volumes relative to the previous product generation which can impact gross margin 

we operate globally and are subject to significant risks in many jurisdictions 

global or regional conditions may harm our financial results we have manufacturing assembly and test rd sales and other operations in many countries and some of our business activities may be concentrated in one or more geographic areas moreover sales outside the us accounted for approximately 80  of our revenue for the fiscal year ended december 26 2015  as a result our operations and our financial results including our ability to manufacture assemble and test design develop or sell products may be adversely affected by a number of factors outside of our control including 

 we are subject to laws and regulations worldwide which may differ among jurisdictions affecting our operations in areas including but not limited to ip ownership and infringement tax import and export requirements anticorruption foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy requirements anticompetition advertising employment environment health and safety compliance with such requirements may be onerous and expensive and may otherwise impact our business operations negatively although we have policies controls and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws there can be no assurance that our employees contractors suppliers andor agents will not violate such laws or our policies violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation 

we may be affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in currency exchange rates although most of our sales occur in us dollars expenses may be paid in local currencies an increase in the value of the dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the us where we sell in dollars and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of expenses such as payroll utilities tax and marketing expenses as well as overseas capital expenditures we also conduct certain investing and financing activities in local currencies our hedging programs reduce but do not eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements therefore changes in exchange rates could harm our results of operations and financial condition 

catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results our operations or systems could be disrupted by natural disasters geopolitical conditions terrorist activity public health issues cybersecurity incidents interruptions of service from utilities transportation or telecommunications providers or other catastrophic events such events could make it difficult or impossible to manufacture or deliver products to our customers receive production materials from our suppliers or perform critical functions which could adversely affect our revenue and require significant recovery time and expenditures to resume operations while we maintain business recovery plans that are intended to enable us to recover from natural disasters or other events that can be disruptive to our business some of our systems are not fully redundant and we cannot be sure that our plans will fully protect us from all such disruptions 

we maintain a program of insurance coverage for a variety of property casualty and other risks the types and amounts of insurance we obtain vary depending on availability cost and decisions with respect to risk retention some of our policies have large deductibles and broad exclusions in addition one or more of our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim losses not covered by insurance may be large which could harm our results of operations and financial condition 

we operate our own fabrication facilities and as a result are vulnerable to manufacturingrelated risks 

due to the variability in demand for our products we may be unable to timely respond to reduce costs when demand declines or to increase production when demand increases our operations have high costs that are either fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term including our costs related to manufacturing such as facility construction and equipment rd and the employment and training of a highly skilled workforce if product demand decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately we could be required to write off inventory or record excess capacity charges which would lower our gross margin our manufacturing or assembly and test capacity could be underutilized and we may be required to write down our longlived assets which would increase our expenses factoryplanning decisions may shorten the useful lives of facilities and equipment and cause us to accelerate depreciation 

conversely if product demand increases we may be unable to add capacity fast enough to meet market demand our revenue and gross margin can also be affected by the timing of our product introductions and related expenses including marketing expenses 

we are subject to risks associated with the development and implementation of new manufacturing process technology we may not be successful or efficient in developing or implementing new production processes production of integrated circuits is a complex process we are continually engaged in the transition from our existing process to the nextgeneration process technology this consistent innovation involves significant expense and carries inherent risks including difficulties in designing and developing nextgeneration process technologies development and production timing delays lower than anticipated manufacturing yields and product defects and errata disruptions in the production process can also result from errors defects in materials delays in obtaining or revising operating permits and licenses interruption in our supply of materials or resources and disruptions at our fabrication and assembly and test facilities due to accidents maintenance issues or unsafe working conditions—all of which could affect the timing of production ramps and yields production issues can lead to increased costs and may affect our ability to meet product demand which could adversely impact our business and the results from operations 

we face supply chain risks thousands of suppliers provide materials that we use in production and other aspects of our business where possible we seek to have several sources of supply for all of those materials however for certain materials we may rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers or upon suppliers in a single location in addition consolidation among suppliers could impact the nature quality availability and pricing of the products and services available to us the inability of suppliers to deliver adequate supplies of production materials or other supplies could disrupt our production processes or make it more difficult for us to implement our business strategy production could be disrupted by the unavailability of resources used in production such as water silicon electricity gases and other materials the unavailability or reduced availability of materials or resources may require us to reduce production or incur additional costs which could harm our business and results of operations 

we also rely on thirdparty providers to manufacture and assemble and test certain components or products particularly those related to networking mobile and communications and nand flash memory if any of these third parties are unable to perform these services on a timely basis we may encounter supply delays or disruptions that could adversely affect our financial results 

in addition there are regulatory and other requirements restrictions and requests from various constituencies regarding sourcing practices and supplier conduct with a trend toward expanding the scope of materials and locations where materials originate regulating supplier behaviors and increasing the required disclosures regarding such matters by public companies increased regulation and public pressure in this area would cause our compliance costs to increase and could negatively affect our reputation given that we use many materials in the manufacturing of our products and rely on many suppliers to provide these materials but do not directly control their procurement or employment practices 

we are subject to the risks of product defects and errata product defects and errata deviations from published specifications may result from problems in our product design or our manufacturing and assembly and test processes components and products we purchase or license from thirdparty suppliers may also contain defects 

costs from defects and errata could include 

 these costs could be large and may increase expenses and lower gross margin and result in delay or loss of revenue any product defects errata or other issues that we do not detect or fix could also damage our reputation negatively affect product demand delay product releases or result in legal liability the announcement of product defects and errata could cause customers to purchase products from competitors as a result of possible shortages of our components or for other reasons any of these occurrences could harm our business and financial results 

we are subject to risks associated with environmental laws and regulations the manufacturing and assembly and test of our products require the use of hazardous materials that are subject to a broad array of ehs laws and regulations our failure to comply with these laws or regulations could result in 

 our failure to manage the use transportation emissions discharge storage recycling or disposal of hazardous materials could lead to increased costs or future liabilities our ability to expand or modify our manufacturing capability in the future may be impeded by environmental regulations such as air quality and wastewater requirements environmental laws and regulations could also require us to acquire pollution abatement or remediation equipment modify product designs or incur other expenses many new materials that we are evaluating for use in our operations may be subject to regulation under environmental laws and regulations these restrictions could harm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter manufacturing and assembly and test processes 

climate change may also pose regulatory and environmental risks that could harm our results of operations and affect the way we conduct business for example climate change regulation could result in increased manufacturing costs associated with air pollution control requirements and increased or new monitoring recordkeeping and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions we also see the potential for higher energy costs driven by climate change regulations if for example utility companies pass on their costs to their customers furthermore many of our operations are located in semiarid regions that may become increasingly vulnerable to prolonged droughts due to climate change our fabrication facilities require significant water use and while we recycle and reuse a portion of the water used we may have difficulties obtaining sufficient water to fulfill our operational needs due the lack of available infrastructure 

we are subject to ip risks and risks associated with litigation and regulatory proceedings 

we may be unable to enforce or protect our ip rights we regard our patents copyrights trade secrets and other ip rights as important to the success of our business we rely on ip law as well as confidentiality and licensing agreements with our customers employees technology development partners and others to protect our ip rights our ability to enforce these rights is subject to general litigation risks as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our ip rights in various countries when we seek to enforce our rights we may be subject to claims that the ip rights are invalid not enforceable or licensed to the opposing party our assertion of ip rights may result in the other party seeking to assert claims against us which could harm our business governments may adopt regulations—and governments or courts may render decisions—requiring compulsory licensing of ip rights or governments may require products to meet standards that serve to favor local companies our inability to enforce our ip rights under any of these circumstances may harm our competitive position and business in addition the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products as a result the value of our investment in rd product development and marketing could be reduced 

our licenses with other companies and participation in industry initiatives may allow competitors to use our patent rights companies in our industry often bilaterally license patents between each other to settle disputes or as part of business agreements our competitors may have licenses to our patents and under current case law some of the licenses may exhaust our patent rights as to licensed product sales under some circumstances our participation in industry standards organizations or with other industry initiatives may require us to license our patents to companies that adopt industrystandard specifications depending on the rules of the organization we might have to grant these licenses to our patents for little or no cost and as a result we may be unable to enforce certain patents against others our costs of enforcing our licenses or protecting our patents may increase and the value of our ip rights may be impaired 

third parties may assert claims based on ip rights against us or our products which could harm our business we may face claims based on ip rights from individuals and companies including those who have acquired patent portfolios to assert claims against other companies we are normally engaged in a number of litigation matters involving ip rights claims that our products or processes infringe the ip rights of others whether or not meritorious could cause us to incur large costs to respond to defend and resolve and they may divert the efforts and attention of management and technical personnel in addition we may face claims based on the theft or unauthorized use or disclosure of thirdparty trade secrets and other confidential business information or enduser data that we obtain in conducting our business any such incidents and claims could severely disrupt our business and we could suffer losses including the cost of product recalls and returns and reputational harm furthermore we have agreed to indemnify customers for certain ip rights claims against them as a result of ip rights claims we could 

 these ip rights claims could harm our competitive position result in expenses or require us to impair our assets if we alter or stop production of affected items our revenue could be harmed 

we rely on access to thirdparty ip which may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all many of our products include thirdparty ip andor implement industry standards which may require licenses from third parties based on past experience and industry practice we believe such licenses generally can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms however there is no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all failure to obtain the right to use thirdparty ip or to use such ip on commercially reasonable terms could preclude us from selling certain products or otherwise have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results 

we are subject to the risks associated with litigation and regulatory proceedings we may face legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder consumer competition and other issues on a global basis as described in  note 25 contingencies  in part ii item 8 of this form 10k we are engaged in a number of litigation and regulatory matters litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain and adverse rulings could occur including monetary damages or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products engaging in certain business practices or requiring other remedies such as compulsory licensing of patents an unfavorable outcome may result in a material adverse impact on our business results of operations financial position and overall trends in addition regardless of the outcome litigation can be costly timeconsuming disruptive to our operations and distracting to management 

we must attract retain and motivate key employees 

to be competitive we must attract retain and motivate executives and other key employees hiring and retaining qualified executives scientists engineers technical staff and sales representatives are critical to our business and competition for experienced employees can be intense to help attract retain and motivate qualified employees we use sharebased and other performancebased incentive awards such as restricted stock units rsus and cash bonuses if our sharebased or other compensation programs cease to be viewed as competitive and valuable benefits our ability to attract retain and motivate employees could be weakened which could harm our results of operations 

we are subject to cybersecurity and privacy risks 

third parties attempt to gain unauthorized access to our network products services and infrastructure we regularly face attempts by others to gain unauthorized access through the internet or to introduce malicious software to our information technology it systems additionally malicious hackers may attempt to gain unauthorized access and corrupt the processes of hardware and software products that we manufacture and services we provide due to the widespread use of our products and the high profile of our commercial security products we or our products and services are a frequent target of computer hackers and organizations that intend to sabotage take control of or otherwise corrupt our manufacturing or other processes products and services we are also a target of malicious attackers who attempt to gain access to our network or data centers or those of our customers or end users steal proprietary information related to our business products employees and customers or interrupt our systems and services or those of our customers or others we believe such attempts are increasing in number and in technical sophistication from time to time we encounter intrusions or unauthorized access to our network products services or infrastructure to date none have resulted in any material adverse impact to our business or operations in some instances we our customers and the users of our products and services might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects while we seek to detect and investigate all unauthorized attempts and attacks against our network products and services and to prevent their recurrence where practicable through changes to our internal processes and tools andor changes or patches to our products and services we remain potentially vulnerable to additional known or unknown threats such incidents whether successful or unsuccessful could result in our incurring significant costs related to for example rebuilding internal systems reduced inventory value providing modifications to our products and services defending against litigation responding to regulatory inquiries or actions paying damages or taking other remedial steps with respect to third parties in addition these threats are constantly evolving thereby increasing the difficulty of successfully defending against them or implementing adequate preventative measures publicity about vulnerabilities and attempted or successful incursions could damage our reputation with customers or users and reduce demand for our products and services 

we may be subject to theft loss or misuse of personal data about our employees customers or other third parties which could increase our expenses damage our reputation or result in legal or regulatory proceedings the theft loss or misuse of personal data collected used stored or transferred by us to run our business could result in significantly increased security costs or costs related to defending legal claims global privacy legislation enforcement and policy activity in this area are rapidly expanding and creating a complex regulatory compliance environment costs to comply with and implement these privacyrelated and data protection measures could be significant in addition even our inadvertent failure to comply with federal state or international privacyrelated or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others 

we are subject to risks associated with transactions 

we invest in companies for strategic reasons and may not realize a return on our investments we make investments in public and private companies around the world to further our strategic objectives and support key business initiatives many of the instruments in which we invest are nonmarketable at the time of our initial investment companies in which we invest range from earlystage companies still defining their strategic direction to mature companies with established revenue streams and business models the success of our investment in any company is typically dependent on the availability to the company of additional funding on favorable terms or a liquidity event such as a public offering or acquisition if any of the companies in which we invest fail we could lose all or part of our investment if we determine that an otherthantemporary decline in the fair value exists for an investment we write down the investment to its fair value and recognize a loss 

our acquisitions divestitures and other transactions could fail to achieve strategic objectives disrupt our ongoing business and harm our results of operations in pursuing   our business strategy we routinely conduct discussions evaluate opportunities and enter into agreements for possible acquisitions divestitures and other transactions such as joint ventures given that our resources are limited our decision to complete an acquisition has opportunity costs and we may need to forgo the prospect of acquiring other companies or technologies that could help us achieve our strategic objectives in addition to opportunity costs these transactions involve large challenges and risks including risks that 

 when we decide to sell assets or a business we may have difficulty selling on acceptable terms in a timely manner and the agreedupon terms and financing arrangements could be renegotiated due to changes in business or market conditions these circumstances could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives or cause us to incur additional expense or we may sell a business at a price or on terms that are less favorable than we had anticipated resulting in a loss on the transaction 

if we do enter into agreements with respect to acquisitions divestitures or other transactions we may fail to complete them due to factors such as 

 we are subject to salesrelated risks 

we face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties we sell a significant portion   of our products through third parties such as distributors valueadded resellers oems odms internet service providers and channel partners collectively referred to as distributors using third parties for distribution exposes us to many risks including competitive pressure concentration credit risk and compliance risks distributors may sell products that compete with our products and we may need to provide financial and other incentives to focus distributors on the sale of our products we may rely on one or more key distributors for a product and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue distributors may face financial difficulties including bankruptcy which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and financial results violations of the foreign corrupt practices act or similar laws by distributors or other thirdparty intermediaries could have a material impact on our business failure to manage risks related to our use of distributors may reduce sales increase expenses and weaken our competitive position 

we face risks related to business transactions with us government entities we receive proceeds from services and products we provide to the us government us government demand and payment may be affected by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations us government contracts are subject to oversight including special rules on accounting ip rights expenses reviews information handling and security failure to comply with these rules could result in civil and criminal penalties and sanctions including termination of contracts fines and suspensions or debarment from future us government business 

our results of operations could vary as a result of the methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying accounting policies 

the methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying accounting policies have a large impact on our results of operations for more information see critical accounting estimates in part ii item 7 of this form 10k these methods estimates and judgments are subject to large risks uncertainties and assumptions and changes could affect our results of operations 

changes in our effective tax rate may reduce our net income 

a number of factors may increase our effective tax rates which could reduce our net income including 

 we may have fluctuations in the amount and frequency of our stock repurchases 

the amount timing and execution of our stock repurchase program may fluctuate based on our priorities for the use of cash for other purposes—such as investing in our business including operational spending capital spending and acquisitions and returning cash to our stockholders as dividend payments—and because of changes in cash flows and changes in tax laws 

workforce restructuring actions may be disruptive to our operations and adversely affect our financial results 

in response to the business environment and to accomplish our strategic objectives from time to time we may restructure our operations or make other adjustments to our workforce such workforce changes can result in restructuring charges in addition to those described in  note 13 restructuring and asset impairment charges  in part ii item 8 of this form 10k such workforce changes can also temporarily reduce workforce productivity which could be disruptive to our business and adversely affect our results of operations in addition we may not achieve or sustain the expected cost savings or other benefits of our restructuring plans or do so within the expected time frame 

there are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of our controls 

we do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how welldesigned and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met the design of a control system must reflect the fact that resource constraints exist and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks over time controls may become inadequate due to changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures if our controls become inadequate we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations our reputation may be adversely affected our business and operating results could be harmed and the market price of our stock could decline

overview 

our results of operations for each period were as follows 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

we achieved record net revenue for q4 2015  of 149 billion  up   1  from q4 2014  we continue to see our business evolve as we execute on our strategy to leverage the virtuous cycle of growth with higher dcg platform nsg and iotg platform revenue these operating segments made up nearly 40 of our revenue and more than 60 of our operating profit for full year 2015  dcg and iotg both posted record net revenue for the quarter and was partially offset by lower ccg platform revenue we continue to believe that the worldwide pc supply chain is healthy with appropriate levels of inventory 

gross margin of 64   decrease d by approximately one  percentage point from q4 2014  primarily due to higher platform unit costs that resulted in part from a higher mix of 14nm platforms and lower platform unit sales these decreases were partially offset by higher platform average selling prices and to a lesser extent lower factory startup costs gross margin increased approximately two percentage points compared to the midpoint of the business outlook in october 2015 primarily driven by lower platform unit costs lower factory startup costs and higher platform average selling prices 

for full year 2015  our net revenue of 554 billion  was down   1  from 2014  operating income of 140 billion  was down   9  from 2014  and diluted earnings per share of 233  were up   1  from 2014  ccg net revenue was down   8  as we continued to see weakness in the macroeconomic environment and in particular the pc market as we were coming off of a strong growth rate in the second half of 2014  with the microsoft windows xp refresh we continue to see growth in dcg with net revenue up   11  and platform unit sales and average selling prices up 8  and 3  respectively 

gross margin of 63  was down  approximately one point from 2014  driven by higher platform unit costs on 14nm and lower platform unit sales these decreases were partially offset by higher platform average selling prices primarily driven by a higher mix of dcg platforms and higher average selling prices on a richer mix of platforms within the desktop and dcg platforms to a lesser extent the decrease in gross margin was also partially offset by lower factory startup costs on 14nm as well as lower production costs on 14nm which were treated as a period charge in 2014 operating profit was 140 billion  in 2015  a decrease  of 13 billion  from 2014  driven by lower gross margin and increased investments in our growth market segments of the data center internet of things and memory our operating profit decrease was partially offset by lower investment in the pc market segment our effective tax rate for 2015  of 196  decreased 63 points from 2014  driven by onetime items and our decision to indefinitely reinvest certain prior years’ nonus earnings 

the cash generation from our business remained strong with cash from operations of 190 billion  in 2015  during 2015  we purchased 73 billion  of capital assets down 28 billion from 2014  this change was primarily driven by our new strategy on nextgeneration process technology and manufacturing efficiencies namely that we extended the length of time we plan to use the 14nm process technology by introducing a third 14nm product codenamed kaby lake this product will have key performance enhancements as compared to our 6th generation intel core processor family  we also returned cash to stockholders by both paying 46 billion  in dividends and repurchasing 30 billion  of common stock through our stock repurchase program we ended the year with an investment portfolio of 253 billion  up approximately 113 billion  from a year ago that investment portfolio consisted of cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and trading assets we issued approximately 95 billion of longterm debt to finance our altera acquisition for further information see  note 15 borrowings  in part ii item 8 of this form 10k effective in q1 2016 our annual dividend increased 008 to 104 per share and our board of directors declared a cash dividend of 026 per share of common stock 

early in q1 2016 we completed the acquisition of altera the acquisition will couple intel’s leadingedge products and manufacturing process with altera’s leading fpga technology the combination is expected to enable new classes of products that meet customer needs in the data center and internet of things market segments we believe our product offerings and architectures will continue to enable innovation and growth in the data center and the internet of things market segments the impact of the altera acquisition has been reflected in our business outlook published in our january 2016 earnings release for further information see  note 8 acquisitions  in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

our business outlook for q1 2016  and full year 2016  includes where applicable our current expectations for revenue gross margin percentage spending rd plus mga and capital expenditures we publish our business outlook in our quarterly earnings release 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

our business outlook and any updates thereto are publicly available on our investor relations website   wwwintccom  this business outlook is not incorporated by reference in this form 10k we expect that our corporate representatives will from time to time meet publicly or privately with investors and others and may reiterate the forwardlooking statements contained in the business outlook or in this form 10k the statements in the business outlook and forwardlooking statements in this form 10k are subject to revision during the course of the year in our quarterly earnings releases and sec filings and at other times the forwardlooking statements in the business outlook will be effective through the close of business on march 18 2016  unless updated earlier from the close of business on march 18 2016  until our quarterly earnings release is published currently scheduled for april 19 2016  we will observe a quiet period during the quiet period the business outlook and other forwardlooking statements first published in our form 8k filed on january 14 2016  and other forwardlooking statements disclosed in the companys news releases and filings with the sec as reiterated or updated as applicable in this form 10k should be considered historical speaking as of prior to the quiet period only and not subject to update during the quiet period our representatives will not comment on our business outlook or our financial results or expectations the exact timing and duration of the routine quiet period and any others that we utilize from time to time may vary at our discretion 

critical accounting estimates 

the methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our consolidated financial statements some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain our most critical accounting estimates include 

 in the following section we discuss these policies further as well as the estimates and judgments involved 

nonmarketable equity investments 

we regularly invest in nonmarketable equity instruments of private companies which range from earlystage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models the carrying value of our nonmarketable equity investment portfolio excluding equity derivatives totaled 45 billion  as of december 26 2015   32 billion  as of december 27 2014  

our nonmarketable equity investments are recorded using the cost method or the equity method of accounting depending on the facts and circumstances of each investment our nonmarketable equity investments are classified within other longterm assets on the consolidated balance sheets 

nonmarketable equity investments are inherently risky and their success depends on product development market acceptance operational efficiency and other key business factors the companies could fail or not be able to raise additional funds when needed or they may receive lower valuations with less favorable investment terms than previous financings these events could cause our investments to become impaired in addition financial market volatility could negatively affect our ability to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings mergers and private sales for further information about our investment portfolio risks see risk factors in part i item 1a of this form 10k 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

we determine the fair value of our nonmarketable equity investments portfolio quarterly for impairment and disclosure purposes however the investments are recorded at fair value only if an impairment is recognized the measurement of fair value requires significant judgment and includes a qualitative and quantitative analysis of events or circumstances that impact the fair value of the investment qualitative analysis of our investments involves understanding each investee’s revenue and earnings trends relative to predefined milestones and overall business prospects the technological feasibility of our investee’s products and technologies the general market conditions in the investee’s industry or geographic area including adverse regulatory or economic changes and the management and governance structure of the investee quantitative assessments of the fair value of our investments are developed using the market and income approaches the market approach includes the use of financial metrics and ratios of comparable public companies such as revenue earnings comparable performance multiples recent financing rounds the terms of investees’ issued interests and the level of marketability of the investments the selection of comparable companies requires management judgment and is based on a number of factors including comparable companies’ sizes growth rates industries and development stages the income approach includes the use of a discounted cash flow model which requires significant estimates regarding the investees revenue costs and discount rates based on the risk profile of comparable companies estimates of revenue and costs are developed using available market historical and forecast data 

if the fair value of an investment is below our carrying value we determine whether the investment is otherthantemporarily impaired based on our quantitative and qualitative analysis which includes assessing the severity and duration of the impairment and the likelihood of recovery before disposal if the investment is considered to be otherthantemporarily impaired we record the investment at fair value by recognizing an impairment impairments of nonmarketable equity investments were 166 million  in 2015   140 million  in 2014  and 112 million  in 2013  

property plant and equipment depreciation 

management judgment is required in determining the estimated economic useful lives of our property plant and equipment which can materially impact our depreciation expense accordingly at least annually we evaluate the period over which we expect to recover the economic value of these assets during the assessment performed in q4 2015 we considered factors such as the lengthening of the process technology cadence resulting in longer node transitions on both 14nm and 10nm products with those longer transitions we added a third product to our 14nm roadmap we have also increased reuse of machinery and tools across each generation of process technology as a result we determined that the useful lives of machinery and equipment in our wafer fabrication facilities should be increased from four to five years we will account for this as a change in estimate that will be applied prospectively effective in q1 2016 this change in depreciable life drives approximately 15 billion in lower depreciation expense for 2016 approximately half of this benefit will increase gross margin impacting both unit cost and startup costs approximately onefourth will decrease rd expenses and the remaining onefourth will result in lower inventory costs and ending inventory values 

as part of our longrange capacity planning construction on certain facilities is on hold and the facilities are not in use these facilities are being held in a safe state and we have plans to place them into service at a future date  the time at which these assets are placed into service depends on our existing manufacturing capacity market demand for specific products and where we are in the transition of products on our roadmap management is required to make judgments as to the timing of when these facilities will be readied for their intended use and placed into service for the manufacturing of our products which is when depreciation begins 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

business combinations 

accounting for acquisitions requires our management to estimate the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired which involves a number of judgments assumptions and estimates that could materially affect the timing or amounts recognized in our financial statements the items involving the most significant assumptions estimates and judgments include determining the fair value of the following 

 we allocate goodwill and intangible assets to the reporting units based on the reporting units that are expected to benefit from the business combination upon any reorganization of our operating segments we reevaluate our reporting units and if necessary reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach 

our assumptions and estimates are based upon comparable market data and information obtained from our management and the management of the acquired companies while we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement as a result during the measurement period which may be up to one year following the acquisition date we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill 

longlived asset impairments 

property plant and equipment 

we assess property plant and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant underperformance of a business or product line in relation to expectations significant negative industry or economic trends and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets we measure the recoverability of assets that we will continue to use in our operations by comparing the carrying value of the asset grouping to our estimate of the related total future undiscounted net cash flows if an asset grouping’s carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows the asset grouping is considered to be impaired we measure the impairment by comparing the difference between the asset grouping’s carrying value and its fair value property plant and equipment is considered a nonfinancial asset and is recorded at fair value only if an impairment charge is recognized 

impairments are determined for groups of assets related to the lowest level of identifiable independent cash flows due to our asset usage model and the interchangeable nature of our semiconductor manufacturing capacity we must make subjective judgments in determining the independent cash flows that can be related to specific asset groupings 

in addition as we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions we must make subjective judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets primarily processspecific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements when we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated we accelerate the rate of depreciation over the assets’ new shorter useful lives based on our analysis impairments and accelerated depreciation of our property plant and equipment totaled 151 million  in 2015   115 million  in 2014  and 172 million  in 2013  

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

identified intangibles 

we make judgments about the recoverability of purchased finitelived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist recoverability of finitelived intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate we perform an annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each year for indefinitelived intangible assets or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist to determine whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable recoverability of indefinitelived intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future discounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate if we determine that an individual asset is impaired the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset 

the assumptions and estimates used to determine future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible and other longlived assets are complex and subjective they can be affected by various factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our forecasts for specific product lines based on our impairment assessment we recognized impairment charges of 7 million  in 2015   36 million  in 2014  and 17 million  in 2013  

goodwill 

goodwill is recorded when the purchase price of an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired goodwill is allocated to our reporting units based on the relative expected fair value provided by the acquisition reporting units may be operating segments as a whole or an operation one level below an operating segment referred to as a component and are consistent with the operating segments identified in  note 26 operating segments and geographic information  in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

we perform an annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist  to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit in which goodwill resides is less than its carrying value for reporting units in which this assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than its carrying value goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test qualitative factors considered in this assessment include industry and market considerations overall financial performance and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit additionally as part of this assessment we may perform a quantitative analysis to support the qualitative factors above by applying sensitivities to assumptions and inputs used in measuring a reporting unit’s fair value for reporting units in which the impairment assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying value we perform the first step of the goodwill impairment test which compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform additional analysis if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit then we must perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill if we determine during the second step that the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value we record an impairment loss equal to the difference 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions our goodwill impairment test uses a weighting of the income method and the market method to estimate a reporting unit’s fair value the income method is based on a discounted future cash flow approach that uses the following assumptions and inputs revenue based on assumed market segment growth rates and our assumed market segment share estimated costs and appropriate discount rates based on a reporting units weighted average cost of capital as determined by considering the observable weighted average cost of capital of comparable companies our estimates of market segment growth our market segment share and costs are based on historical data various internal estimates and a variety of external sources these estimates are developed as part of our routine longrange planning process the same estimates are also used in planning for our longterm manufacturing and assembly and test capacity needs as part of our capital budgeting process and for longterm and shortterm business planning and forecasting we test the reasonableness of the inputs and outcomes of our discounted cash flow analysis against available comparable market data the market method is based on financial multiples of comparable companies and applies a control premium a reporting unit’s carrying value represents the assignment of various assets and liabilities excluding certain corporate assets and liabilities such as cash investments and debt 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

for the annual impairment assessment in 2015  we determined that for each of our reporting units with significant amounts of goodwill it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units exceeded the carrying value as a result we concluded that performing the first step of the goodwill impairment test was not necessary for those reporting units during the fourth quarter of each of the prior three fiscal years we completed our annual impairment assessments and concluded that goodwill was not impaired in any of these years 

income taxes 

we must make estimates and judgments in determining the provision for taxes for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes as well as the interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions significant changes in these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 

we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets if recovery is not more likely than not we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable we believe that we will ultimately recover the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets however should a change occur in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery is not more likely than not recovery of a portion of our deferred tax assets is impacted by management’s plans with respect to holding or disposing of certain investments therefore changes in management’s plans with respect to holding or disposing of investments could affect our future provision for taxes 

we use a twostep process to recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining whether the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any if we determine that a tax position will more likely than not be sustained on audit the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50  likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and may not accurately forecast actual outcomes determining whether an uncertain tax position is effectively settled requires judgment such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 

we have not recognized us deferred income taxes on certain undistributed nonus earnings because we plan to indefinitely reinvest such earnings outside the us remittances of nonus earnings are based on estimates and judgments of projected cash flow needs as well as the working capital and investment requirements of our nonus and us operations material changes in our estimates of cash working capital and investment needs in various jurisdictions could require repatriation of indefinitely reinvested nonus earnings which would be subject to us income taxes and applicable nonus income and withholding taxes 

inventory 

intel has a product development life cycle that corresponds with substantive engineering milestones these engineering milestones are regularly and consistently applied in assessing the point at which our activities and associated costs change in nature from rd to cost of sales in order for a product to be manufactured in high volumes and sold to our customers under our standard warranty it must meet our rigorous technical quality specifications this milestone is known as product release qualification prq we have identified prq as the point at which the costs incurred to manufacture our products are included in the valuation of inventory 

to determine which costs can be included in the valuation of inventory we must determine normal capacity at our manufacturing and assembly and test facilities based on historical loadings compared to total available capacity if the factory loadings are below the established normal capacity level a portion of our manufacturing overhead costs would not be included in the cost of inventory therefore it would be recognized as cost of sales in that period which would negatively impact our gross margin we refer to these costs as excess capacity charges excess capacity charges were insignificant  in 2015   insignificant  in 2014  and 319 million  in 2013  

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions productspecific facts and circumstances reviewed in the inventory valuation process include a review of our customer base the stage of the product life cycle of our products consumer confidence customer acceptance of our products and an assessment of selling price in relation to product cost if the estimated market value of the inventory is less than the carrying value we write down the inventory and record the difference as a charge to cost of sales inventory reserves increased  by approximately 185 million  in 2015  compared to 2014  

the valuation of inventory also requires us to estimate obsolete and excess inventory as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality the demand forecast is utilized in the development of our shortterm manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuation and build decisions the estimate of future demand is compared to workinprocess and finished goods inventory levels to determine the amount if any of obsolete or excess inventory if our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly we could be required to write off inventory which would negatively impact our gross margin 

loss contingencies 

we are subject to loss contingencies including various legal and regulatory proceedings and asserted and potential claims accruals related to repair or replacement of parts in connection with product defects as well as product warranties and potential asset impairments that arise in the ordinary course of business an estimated loss from such contingencies is recognized as a charge to income if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated disclosure of a loss contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a material loss has been incurred the outcomes of legal and administrative proceedings and claims and the estimation of product warranties and asset impairments are subject to significant uncertainty significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether a loss is reasonably estimable at least quarterly we review the status of each significant matter and we may revise our estimates these revisions could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

results of operations 

consolidated statements of income data as a percentage of net revenue for each period were as follows 

our net revenue in   2015   decreased   by   515 million  or   1  compared to   2014  platform unit sales were down   9  due to challenging macroeconomic conditions particularly in the first half of the year and higher pc demand in 2014 driven by the microsoft windows xp refresh the decrease in pc demand was partially offset by higher dcg and iotg platform unit sales the decrease in revenue was partially offset by higher platform average selling prices which were up   8  as we benefited from a higher mix of dcg platform unit sales and higher average selling prices on desktop and dcg platforms to a lesser extent the decrease in revenue was partially offset by higher nsg revenue 

our overall gross margin percentage was 626  in 2015  down from 637  in 2014  the decrease  in gross margin percentage was primarily due to the gross margin decrease  in the ccg operating segment we derived a substantial majority of our overall gross margin dollars for 2015  and 2014  from the sale of platforms in the ccg and dcg operating segments our overall gross margin dollars in 2015   decreased  by 930 million  or 3  compared to 2014  the following results drove the change in gross margin in 2015  compared to 2014  by approximately the amounts indicated 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

our net revenue for 2014  was up   32 billion  or 6  compared to 2013  platform unit sales were up   19  primarily driven by the ramp of our tablet platform and strength in the traditional pc business to a lesser extent higher nsg revenue also contributed to the increase these increases were partially offset by lower platform average selling prices which were down   10  primarily on mix shift on significantly higher tablet and phone platform unit sales and cash consideration associated with integrating our tablet and phone platforms to a lesser extent lower ccg phone component unit sales partially offset the increase in revenue 

our overall gross margin percentage was 637  in 2014  up from 598 in 2013  the increase in gross margin percentage was primarily due to the gross margin increase in the ccg and dcg operating segments we derived most of our overall gross margin dollars for 2014  and 2013  from the sale of platforms in the ccg and dcg operating segments our overall gross margin dollars for 2014  increased by 41 billion or 13 compared to 2013  the following results drove the change in gross margin in 2014  compared to 2013  by approximately the amounts indicated 

 client computing group 

the revenue and operating income for the ccg operating segment for 2015  and 2014  were as follows

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

rd spending increased  by 926 million  or 9  in 2014  compared to 2013  the increase  was due to higher process development costs for our 10nm process technology higher compensation expenses for both profitdependent compensation and annual salary increases as well as higher investments in our products primarily server and new devices this increase  was partially offset by lower product investments in our phone tablet and intel media businesses 

marketing general and administrative

gains losses on equity investments and interest and other net 

gains losses on equity investments net and interest and other net for each period were as follows 

we recognized lower net gains on equity investments in 2015 compared to 2014 due to lower gains on sales of equity investments partially offset by higher gains on thirdparty merger transactions 

we recognized lower net gains on equity investments in 2014 compared to 2013 due to lower gains on sales of equity investments partially offset by higher gains on thirdparty merger transactions the majority of gains on sales net for 2014 resulted from gains on private equity sales net gains on equity investments for 2013 included gains of 439 million  on the sales of our interest in clearwire communications llc and our shares in clearwire corporation in q3 2013 for further information on these transactions see  note 5 cash and investments  in part ii item 8 of this form 10k

we recognized an interest and other net gain in 2014 compared to a net loss in 2013 due to a gain recognized on the divestiture of our intel media assets in 2014 

provision for taxes 

our provision for taxes and effective tax rate for each period were as follows 

most of the decrease in our effective tax rate in 2015  compared to 2014  was driven by onetime items a higher proportion of our income from lower tax jurisdictions and our decision to indefinitely reinvest certain prior years’ nonus earnings positively impacted our effective income tax rate 

a substantial majority of the increase in our effective tax rate between 2014  and 2013 was driven by the reenacted us rd tax credit in 2013 containing two years worth of rd tax credits the us rd tax credit was reenacted in q4 2014 retroactive for the full year it was also reenacted in q1 2013 retroactive to the beginning of 2012

sources and uses of cash 

in millions 

in summary our cash flows for each period were as follows 

operating activities 

cash provided by  operating activities is net income adjusted for certain noncash items and changes in assets and liabilities 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

for 2015  compared to 2014  the 14 billion   decrease  in cash provided by operating activities was due to changes in working capital adjustments for noncash items and lower net income the adjustments for noncash items were lower due primarily to deferred taxes partially offset by higher depreciation income taxes paid net of refunds in 2015  compared to 2014  were 12 billion   lower  due to lower income before taxes in 2015 

changes in assets and liabilities as of december 26 2015  compared to december 27 2014  included a decrease in accrued compensation and benefits this decrease was due to higher profitdependent compensation in 2014 that was paid out in 2015 and an increase in inventories due primarily to the ramp of our 6th generation intel core processor family of products partially offset by the timing of certain tax benefits that reduced our income taxes payable position in 2015 

hewlettpackard company our largest customer in 2014 separated into hp inc and hewlett packard enterprise company on november 1 2015  in 2015 these entities collectively accounted for 18  of our net revenue  18  in 2014  and 17  in 2013  dell inc accounted for 15  of our net revenue  16  in 2014  and 15  in 2013  and lenovo group limited accounted for 13  of our net revenue  12  in 2014  and 12  in 2013  combined these customers accounted for 46  of our net revenue  46  in 2014  and 44  in 2013  and 49  of our accounts receivable as of december 26 2015   43  as of december 27 2014  

for 2014  compared to 2013  the 358 million   decrease  in cash provided by operating activities was due to changes in working capital partially offset by higher net income and adjustment for noncash items 

investing activities 

investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures investment purchases sales maturities and disposals and proceeds from divestitures and cash used for acquisitions our capital expenditures were 73 billion  in 2015   101 billion  in 2014  and 107 billion  in 2013  

the decrease  in cash used for investing activities in 2015  compared to 2014  was primarily due to net trading assets activity which was a source of cash in 2015  compared to a use of cash in 2014  and lower capital expenditures this activity was partially offset by net availableforsale activity which was cash flow neutral in 2015 compared to a source of cash in 2014 and higher investments in nonmarketable equity investments 

the decrease  in cash used for investing activities in 2014  compared to 2013  was primarily due to net availableforsale activity which was a source of cash in 2014  compared to a use of cash in 2013  and a decrease in cash used for net trading assets activity this activity was partially offset by an increase in investments in nonmarketable equity investments 

financing activities 

financing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases of common stock payment of dividends to stockholders issuance and repayment of shortterm and longterm debt and proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock through employee equity incentive plans 

cash was provided by financing activities in 2015  compared to cash used by financing activities in 2014  primarily due to the issuance of 95 billion  of longterm debt and fewer repurchases of common stock under our authorized stock repurchase program partially offset by lower proceeds from the sales of common stock through employee equity incentive plans and repayments of shortterm debt compared to borrowings in 2014  we have an ongoing authorization originally approved by our board of directors in 2005 and subsequently amended to repurchase up to   650 billion  in shares of our common stock in the open market or negotiated transactions during 2015  we repurchased 30 billion  of common stock under our authorized common stock repurchase program compared to 108 billion  in 2014  as of december 26 2015  94 billion  remained available for repurchasing common stock under the existing repurchase authorization limit we base our level of common stock repurchases on internal cash management decisions and this level may fluctuate proceeds from the sale of common stock through employee equity incentive plans totaled 866 million  in 2015  compared to 17 billion  in 2014  our total dividend payments were 46 billion  in 2015  compared to 44 billion  in 2014  we have paid a cash dividend in each of the past 93  quarters in january 2016  our board of directors declared a cash dividend of 026  per share of common stock for q1 2016  the dividend is payable on march 1 2016  to stockholders of record on february 7 2016  

the increase  in cash used for financing activities in 2014  compared to 2013  was primarily due to an increase in repurchases of common stock under our authorized stock repurchase program partially offset by the issuance of shortterm debt in 2014 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

liquidity 

cash generated by operations is our primary source of liquidity we maintain a diverse investment portfolio that we continually analyze based on issuer industry and country as of december 26 2015  cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and trading assets totaled 253 billion   141 billion  as of december 27 2014  the increased balance compared to december 27 2014  was primarily related to the accumulation of cash consideration required for our acquisition of altera which closed on december 28 2015 subsequent to our fiscal 2015 yearend in addition to the 253 billion  we have 19 billion  of other longterm investments 12 billion  of loans receivable and other and 10 billion  of reverse repurchase agreements with original maturities greater than approximately three months that we include when assessing our sources of liquidity substantially all  of our investments in debt instruments are in aa2 or better  rated issuances and a substantial majority  of the issuances are rated aaaa3 or better  

other potential sources of liquidity include our commercial paper program and our automatic shelf registration statement on file with the sec pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt equity and other securities under our commercial paper program we have an ongoing authorization from our board of directors to borrow up to 50 billion  which increased in 2015 from 30 billion  maximum borrowings under our commercial paper program were 900 million  during 2015  and no  commercial paper remained outstanding as of december 26 2015  our commercial paper was rated a1  by standard  poor’s and p1  by moody’s as of december 26 2015  on december 21 2015 we entered into a shortterm credit facility to borrow up to 50 billion  to facilitate the settlement of our acquisition of altera no borrowings were outstanding under this credit facility as of december 26 2015  and it was closed in january 2016 in 2015 we issued 95 billion  aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes these notes were issued primarily to fund a portion of the cash consideration for our pending acquisition of altera and for general corporate purposes which may include the refinancing of existing indebtedness for further information on the terms of the notes see  note 15 borrowings  in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

as of december 26 2015  111 billion  of our 253 billion  of cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and trading assets was held by our nonus subsidiaries of the 111 billion  held by our nonus subsidiaries approximately 26 billion  was available for use in the us without incurring additional us income taxes in excess of the amounts already accrued in our financial statements as of december 26 2015  the remaining amount of nonus cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and trading assets has been indefinitely reinvested and therefore no us current or deferred taxes have been accrued this amount is earmarked for nearterm investment in our operations outside the us and future acquisitions of nonus entities we believe our us sources of cash and liquidity are sufficient to meet our business needs in the us and do not expect that we will need to repatriate the funds we have designated as indefinitely reinvested outside the us under current tax laws should our plans change and we were to choose to repatriate some or all of the funds we have designated as indefinitely reinvested outside the us such amounts would be subject to us income taxes and applicable nonus income and withholding taxes 

during 2015 we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire altera in an allcash transaction the transaction closed on december 28 2015 subsequent to our fiscal 2015 yearend as of the date we entered into the agreement the transaction had an approximate value of 167 billion  we financed a portion of the acquisition by issuing 95 billion  in longterm debt during 2015 and borrowing 40 billion  against our shortterm credit facility in the first quarter of 2016 we funded the remainder of the acquisition with issuances of commercial paper and existing cash and investments for information on our indebtedness see  note 15 borrowings  in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

we believe that we have sufficient financial resources to meet our business requirements in the next 12 months including capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test working capital requirements and potential dividends common stock repurchases acquisitions and strategic investments 

fair value of financial instruments 

when determining fair value we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and we consider assumptions such as an obligor’s credit risk that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability for further information see fair value in  note 2 accounting policies  and  note 4 fair value  in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

marketable debt instruments 

as of december 26 2015  our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included 234 billion  of marketable debt instruments of these instruments 132 billion  was classified as level 1 100 billion  as level 2 and 118 million  as level 3 

our marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 1 were classified as such due to the use of observable market prices for identical instruments that are traded in active markets we evaluate instrumentspecific market data when determining whether the market for a debt instrument is active 

of the 100 billion  of marketable debt instruments measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 2 approximately 50  was classified as level 2 due to the use of a discounted cash flow model performed by us and approximately 50  was classified as such due to the use of nonbinding market consensus prices that were corroborated with observable market data 

our marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 3 are classified as such because the fair values are generally derived from discounted cash flow models performed either by us or our pricing providers using inputs that we are unable to corroborate with observable market data we monitor and review the inputs and results of these valuation models to help ensure the fair value measurements are reasonable and consistent with market experience in similar asset classes 

loans receivable and reverse repurchase agreements 

as of december 26 2015  our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included 479 million  of loans receivable and 24 billion  of reverse repurchase agreements all of these investments were classified as level 2 as the fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data 

marketable equity securities 

as of december 26 2015  our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included 60 billion  of marketable equity securities substantially all of these securities were classified as level 1 because the valuations were based on quoted prices for identical securities in active markets our assessment of an active market for our marketable equity securities generally takes into consideration the number of days that each individual equity security trades over a specified period 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

contractual obligations 

significant contractual obligations as of december 26 2015  were as follows 

 the expected timing of payments of the obligations in the preceding table is estimated based on current information timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations 

contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services included in other purchase obligations and commitments in the preceding table include agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on intel and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction for obligations with cancellation provisions the amounts included in the preceding table were limited to the noncancelable portion of the agreement terms or the minimum cancellation fee 

we have entered into certain agreements for the purchase of raw materials that specify minimum prices and quantities based on a percentage of the total available market or based on a percentage of our future purchasing requirements due to the uncertainty of the future market and our future purchasing requirements as well as the nonbinding nature of these agreements obligations under these agreements have been excluded from the preceding table our purchase orders for other products are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons in addition some of our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

contractual obligations that are contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones have been excluded from the preceding table these obligations include milestonebased comarketing agreements contingent funding or payment obligations and milestonebased equity investment funding these arrangements are not considered contractual obligations until the milestone is met by the counterparty as of december 26 2015  assuming that all future milestones are met excluding the asml milestones mentioned below the additional required payments would be approximately 827 million  during 2012 we entered into a series of agreements with  asml intended to accelerate the development of euv lithography certain of which were amended in 2014 under the amended agreements intel agreed to provide rd funding totaling   €829 million   over five years and committed to advance purchase orders for a specified number of tools from asml  our remaining obligation contingent upon asml achieving certain milestones is approximately €367 million  or 403 million  as of december 26 2015  as our obligation is contingent upon asml achieving certain milestones we have excluded this obligation from the preceding table 

for the majority of rsus granted the number of shares of common stock issued on the date the rsus vest is net of the minimum statutory withholding requirements that we pay in cash to the appropriate taxing authorities on behalf of our employees  the obligation to pay the relevant taxing authority is excluded from the preceding table as the amount is contingent upon continued employment in addition the amount of the obligation is unknown as it is based in part on the market price of our common stock when the awards vest 

during 2014 we entered into a series of agreements with tsinghua unigroup ltd tsinghua unigroup an operating subsidiary of tsinghua holdings co ltd to among other things jointly develop intel architecture and communicationsbased solutions for phones subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions we have also agreed to invest up to 90 billion  chinese yuan approximately 15 billion  as of the date of the agreement for a minority stake of approximately 20  of unispreadtrum during 2015 we invested 966 million  to complete the first phase of the equity investment the second phase of the investment will require additional funding of approximately 500 million  however as our obligation is contingent upon regulatory approvals and other closing conditions it has been excluded from the preceding table 

offbalancesheet arrangements 

as of december 26 2015  we did not have any significant offbalancesheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk 




 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend we are affected by changes in currency exchange rates interest rates and equity prices all of the following potential changes are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial positions as of december 26 2015  and december 27 2014  actual results may differ materially 

currency exchange rates 

in general we economically hedge currency risks of nonusdollardenominated investments in debt instruments and loans receivable with currency forward contracts or currency interest rate swaps gains and losses on these nonuscurrency investments are generally offset by corresponding gains and losses on the related hedging instruments 

substantially all  of our revenue is transacted in us dollars however a significant  portion of our operating expenditures and capital purchases are incurred in or exposed to other currencies primarily the euro the chinese yuan the japanese yen and the israeli shekel  we have established balance sheet and forecasted transaction currency risk management programs to protect against fluctuations in the fair value and the volatility of the functional currency equivalent of future cash flows caused by changes in exchange rates we generally utilize currency forward contracts in these hedging programs these programs reduce but do not eliminate the impact of currency exchange movements  for further information see risk factors in part i item 1a of this form 10k we considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that a weighted average adverse change of 20  in currency exchange rates could be experienced in the near term such an adverse change after taking into account balance sheet hedges only and offsetting recorded monetary asset and liability positions would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before taxes of less than 75 million  as of december 26 2015  less than 50 million  as of december 27 2014  

interest rates 

we generally hedge interest rate risks of fixedrate debt investments with interest rate swaps and we may elect to hedge interest rate risks of our indebtedness gains and losses on these instruments are generally offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments 

we are exposed to interest rate risk related to our investment portfolio and debt issuances the primary objective of our investments in debt instruments is to preserve principal while maximizing yields which generally track the us dollar threemonth libor a hypothetical decrease in benchmark interest rates of up to 10  after taking into account investment hedges would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our investment portfolio of approximately 15 million  as of december 26 2015  an increase of approximately 10 million  as of december 27 2014  after taking into account interest rate and currency swaps a hypothetical decrease in interest rates of up to 10  would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our indebtedness of approximately 16 billion  as of december 26 2015  an increase of approximately 10 billion  as of december 27 2014  the increase from december 27 2014  was primarily driven by the inclusion of 95 billion  of senior unsecured notes issued in q3 and q4 2015 the fluctuations in fair value of our investment portfolio and indebtedness reflect only the direct impact of the change in interest rates other economic variables such as equity market fluctuations and changes in relative credit risk could result in a significantly higher decline in the fair value of our net investment position for further information on how credit risk is factored into the valuation of our investment portfolio and debt issuances see  note 4 fair value  in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

equity prices 

our investments include marketable equity securities and equity derivative instruments we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our equity market exposure through hedging activities at the inception of our investments before we enter into hedge arrangements we evaluate legal market and economic factors as well as the expected timing of disposal to determine whether hedging is appropriate our equity market risk management program may include equity derivatives with or without hedge accounting designation that utilize warrants equity options or other equity derivatives 

we also utilize total return swaps to offset changes in liabilities related to the equity market risks of certain deferred compensation arrangements gains and losses from changes in fair value of these total return swaps are generally offset by the losses and gains on the related liabilities  

as of december 26 2015  the fair value of our marketable equity investments and our equity derivative instruments including hedging positions was 60 billion   71 billion  as of december 27 2014  substantially all  of our marketable equity investments portfolio as of december 26 2015  was concentrated in our investment in asml of 57 billion   69 billion  as of december 27 2014  our marketable equity method investments are excluded from our analysis as the carrying value does not fluctuate based on market price changes unless an otherthantemporary impairment is deemed necessary to determine reasonably possible decreases in the market value of our marketable equity investments we have analyzed the historical market price sensitivity of our marketable equity investment portfolio assuming a decline of 30  in market prices and after reflecting the impact of hedges and offsetting positions the aggregate value of our marketable equity investments could decrease by approximately 18 billion  based on the value as of december 26 2015  a decrease in value of approximately 21 billion  based on the value as of december 27 2014  using an assumed decline of 30  

many of the same factors that could result in an adverse movement of equity market prices affect our nonmarketable equity investments although we cannot always quantify the impact directly financial markets are volatile which could negatively affect the prospects of the companies we invest in their ability to raise additional capital and the likelihood of our ability to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings mergers and private sales these types of investments involve a great deal of risk and there can be no assurance that any specific company will grow or become successful consequently we could lose all or part of our investment our nonmarketable cost method equity investments had a carrying amount of 29 billion  as of december 26 2015   18 billion  as of december 27 2014  and included our investment in unispreadtrum which was made in 2015 and cloudera of 966 million  and 454 million  respectively  454 million  for cloudera as of december 27 2014  the carrying amount of our nonmarketable equity method investments was 16 billion  as of december 26 2015   14 billion  as of december 27 2014  a majority  of our nonmarketable equity method investments balance as of december 26 2015  was concentrated in our imft and cloudera investments of 872 million  and 256 million  respectively  713 million  and 280 million  for imft and cloudera respectively as of december 27 2014

competition 

the computing industry continuously evolves with new and enhanced technologies and products from existing and new providers the marketplace can change quickly in response to the introduction of such technologies and products and other factors such as changes in customer and enduser requirements expectations and preferences as technologies evolve and new market segments emerge the boundaries between the market segments that we compete in are also subject to change 

intel faces significant competition in the development and market acceptance of our products in this environment our platforms based on intel architecture are positioned to compete across the compute continuum from the lowest power and ultramobile devices to the most powerful data center servers our platforms which have integrated hardware and software offer customers benefits such as ease of use savings in total cost of ownership and the ability to scale systems to accommodate increased usage 

competitors 

we compete against other companies that make and sell platforms other silicon components and software to businesses that build and sell computing and communications devices to end users our competitors also include companies that sell goods and services to businesses that utilize them for their internal andor customerfacing processes eg businesses running large data centers in addition we face competition from oems odms and other industrial and communications equipment manufacturers that to some degree choose to vertically integrate their own proprietary semiconductor and software assets by doing so these competitors may be attempting to offer greater differentiation in their products and to increase their share of the profits for each finished product they sell continuing changes in industry participants through for example acquisitions or business collaborations could also have a significant impact on our competitive position 

we are a leading provider in the pc and data center segments where we face existing and emerging competition in the pc market segment ultramobile devices—such as tablets and smartphones offered by numerous vendors— have become significant competitors to pcs for many usages most of these small devices currently use applications processors based on the arm architecture feature lowpower long batterylife operation and are built in soc formats that integrate numerous functions on one chip 

in the data center segment our data center platforms face emerging competition from companies using arm architecture or other technologies internet cloud computing and highperformance computing are areas of significant targeted growth for us in the data center segment and we face strong competition in these market segments 

we are a relatively new entrant to the segments for tablets smartphones and similar ultramobile devices we have adjusted our product roadmaps to emphasize the development of lowpower soc chips for such devices as well the internet of things 

in the internet of things market segment we have a longstanding position as a supplier of components and software for embedded products and this marketplace is significantly expanding with increasing types and numbers of smart and connected devices for industrial commercial and consumer uses in this growing market segment we face numerous large and small incumbent competitors as well as new entrants that use arm architecture and other operating systems and software 

mcafee is a major provider of digital security products and services to businesses and consumers numerous competitors offer security products and services and we seek to offer competitive differentiation by integrating hardware and software security features in many of our offerings and to have security offerings in numerous market segments including mobile and embedded devices and for data centers 

our products primarily compete based on performance energy efficiency integration innovative design features price quality reliability brand recognition and availability the importance of these factors will vary by the type of end system for the products for example performance might be among the most important factors for our products for data center servers while price and integration might be among the most important factors for our products for tablets   smartphones and other mobile devices 

competitive advantages 

our products ability to operate on multiple operating systems in enduser products and platforms operated or sold by third parties including oems is a key competitive advantage we seek to optimize our products for multiple operating systems and invest substantial resources working with third parties to do so but such investments are risky given that it is not clear which products will succeed in the market 

another key competitive advantage is our market lead in transitioning to the nextgeneration process technology and bringing products to market using such technology we have products in the market manufactured using our 14nm process technology and are currently working on the development of our nextgeneration 10nm process technology we believe that these transitions will offer significant improvements in one or more of the following areas performance new features energy efficiency and cost  

moreover the combination of our network of manufacturing and assembly and test facilities with our global architecture design teams is another important competitive advantage we have made significant capital and rd investments into this integrated manufacturing network which enables us to have more direct control over our processes quality control product cost production timing performance power consumption and manufacturing yield the increased cost of constructing new fabrication facilities supporting smaller transistor geometries and larger wafers has led to a smaller pool of companies that can afford to build and equip leadingedge manufacturing facilities most of our competitors rely on thirdparty foundries and subcontractors such as taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company ltd and globalfoundries inc for manufacturing and assembly and test needs we provide foundry services as an alternative to such foundries 

manufacturing and assembly and test 

as of december 27 2014  70  of our wafer fabrication including microprocessors and chipsets was conducted within the us at our facilities in arizona new mexico oregon and massachusetts  our massachusetts fabrication facility is our last manufacturing facility on 200 millimeter mm  wafers and is expected to cease production in q1 2015  the remaining 30  of our wafer fabrication was conducted outside the us at our facilities in israel and china our fabrication facility in ireland is currently transitioning to our 14nm process technology with manufacturing expected to ramp in the second half of 2015  wafer fabrication conducted within and outside the us may be impacted by the timing of a facility’s transition to a newer process technology as well as a facility’s capacity utilization 

as of december 27 2014  we manufactured our products in wafer fabrication facilities at the following locations 

as of december 27 2014  a substantial majority of our microprocessors were manufactured on 300mm wafers using our 14nm 22nm and 32nm process technology as we move to each succeeding generation of manufacturing process technology we incur significant startup costs to prepare each factory for manufacturing however continuing to advance our process technology provides benefits that we believe justify these costs the benefits of moving to each succeeding generation of manufacturing process technology can include using less space per transistor reducing heat output from each transistor and increasing the number of integrated features on each chip these advancements can result in new devices with higher functionality and complexity while controlling power cost and size  in addition with each shift to a new process technology we are able to produce more microprocessors per square foot of our wafer fabrication facilities the costs to develop our process technology are significantly less than adding capacity by building additional wafer fabrication facilities using older process technology 

we use thirdparty foundries to manufacture wafers for certain components including communication and connectivity products in 2014 we qualified our first soc application processor and baseband 3g solution codenamed sofia which will be fabricated by a thirdparty foundry in addition we primarily use subcontractors to manufacture boardlevel products and systems we purchase certain communication and connectivity products from external vendors primarily in the asiapacific region 

following the manufacturing process the majority of our components are subject to assembly and test we perform our components assembly and test at facilities in malaysia china and vietnam  our assembly and test facility in costa rica ceased production in q4 2014 to augment capacity we use subcontractors to perform assembly and test of certain products primarily chipsets and communication and connectivity products 

our nand flash memory products are manufactured by imft and micron using 20nm or 25nm process technology and assembly and test of these products is performed by micron and other external subcontractors for further information see  note 5 cash and investments  in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

our employment and operating practices are consistent with and we expect our suppliers and subcontractors to abide by local country law intel expects all suppliers to comply with our code of conduct and the electronic industry citizenship coalition eicc code of conduct both of which set standards that address the rights of workers to safe and healthy working conditions environmental responsibility compliance with privacy and data security obligations and compliance with applicable laws 

we have thousands of suppliers including subcontractors providing our various materials equipment and service needs we set expectations for supplier performance and reinforce those expectations with periodic assessments and audits we communicate those expectations to our suppliers regularly and work with them to implement improvements when necessary where possible we seek to have several sources of supply for all of these materials and resources but we may rely on a single or limited number of suppliers or upon suppliers in a single country in those cases we develop and implement plans and actions to reduce the exposure that would result from a disruption in supply we have entered into longterm contracts with certain suppliers to help ensure a stable supply of silicon and semiconductor manufacturing tools 

our products are typically manufactured at multiple intel facilities around the world or by subcontractors however some products are manufactured in only one intel or subcontractor facility and we seek to implement action plans to reduce the exposure that would result from a disruption at any such facility see risk factors in part i item 1a of this form 10k

distributors typically handle a wide variety of products including those that compete with our products and fill orders for many customers customers may place orders directly with us or through distributors we have several distribution warehouses that are located in proximity to key customers 

backlog 

over time our larger customers have generally moved to leaninventory or justintime operations rather than maintaining larger inventories of our products as our customers continue to lower their inventories our processes to fulfill their orders have evolved to meet their needs as a result our manufacturing production is based on estimates and advance nonbinding commitments from customers as to future purchases our order backlog as of any particular date is a mix of these commitments and specific firm orders that are primarily made pursuant to standard purchase orders for delivery of products only a small portion of our orders are noncancelable and the dollar amount associated with the noncancelable portion is not significant 

seasonal trends 

historically our net revenue has typically been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year accelerating in the third quarter and peaking in the fourth quarter 

marketing 

our global marketing objectives are to build a strong wellknown intel corporate brand that connects with businesses and consumers and to offer a limited number of meaningful and valuable brands in our portfolio to aid businesses and consumers in making informed choices about technology purchases the intel core processor family and the intel quark intel atom intel ®  celeron ®  intel ®  pentium ®  intel xeon intel xeon phi and intel ®  itanium ®  trademarks make up our processor brands 

we promote brand awareness and preference and generate demand through our own direct marketing as well as through comarketing programs our direct marketing activities primarily include advertising through digital and social media and television as well as consumer and trade events industry and consumer communications and press relations we market to consumer and business audiences and focus on building awareness and generating demand for new form factors such as tablets ultrabook devices and 2 in 1 systems powered by intel our key messaging focuses on increased performance improved energy efficiency and other capabilities such as connectivity communications and security 

purchases by customers often allow them to participate in cooperative advertising and marketing programs such as the intel inside ®  program this program broadens the reach of our brands beyond the scope of our own direct marketing through the intel inside program certain customers are licensed to place intel logos on computing devices containing our microprocessors and processor technologies and to use our brands in their marketing activities the program includes a market development component that accrues funds based on purchases and partially reimburses customers for marketing activities for products featuring intel brands subject to customers meeting defined criteria these marketing activities primarily include advertising through digital and social media and television as well as press relations we have also entered into joint marketing arrangements with certain customers 

intellectual property rights and licensing 

intel owns significant intellectual property ip and related ip rights around the world that relate to our products services rd and other activities and assets our ip portfolio includes patents copyrights trade secrets trademarks trade dress rights and maskwork rights we actively seek to protect our global ip rights and to deter unauthorized use of our ip and other assets such efforts can be difficult however particularly in countries that provide less protection to ip rights and in the absence of harmonized international ip standards while our ip rights are important to our success our business as a whole is not significantly dependent on any single patent copyright or other ip right see risk factors in part i item 1a and  note 25 contingencies  in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

we have obtained patents in the us and other countries because of the fast pace of innovation and product development and the comparative pace of governments’ patenting processes our products are often obsolete before the patents related to them expire in some cases our products may be obsolete before the patents related to them are granted as we expand our products into new industries we also seek to extend our patent development efforts to patent such products in addition to developing patents based on our own rd efforts we purchase patents from third parties to supplement our patent portfolio established competitors in existing and new industries as well as companies that purchase and enforce patents and other ip may already have patents covering similar products there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain patents covering our own products or that we will be able to obtain licenses from other companies on favorable terms or at all 

the software that we distribute including software embedded in our componentlevel and platform products is entitled to copyright and other ip protection to distinguish our products from our competitors’ products we have obtained trademarks and trade names for our products and we maintain cooperative advertising programs with customers to promote our brands and to identify products containing genuine intel components we also protect details about our processes products and strategies as trade secrets keeping confidential the information that we believe provides us with a competitive advantage 

compliance with environmental health and safety regulations 

our compliance efforts focus on monitoring regulatory and resource trends and setting companywide performance targets for key resources and emissions these targets address several parameters including product design chemical energy and water use waste recycling the source of certain minerals used in our products climate change and emissions 

as a company we focus on reducing natural resource use the solid and chemical waste byproducts of our manufacturing processes and the environmental impact of our products we currently use a variety of materials in our manufacturing process that have the potential to adversely impact the environment and are subject to a variety of environmental health and safety ehs laws and regulations over the past several years we have significantly reduced the use of lead and halogenated flame retardants in our products and manufacturing processes 

we work with the us environmental protection agency epa nongovernmental organizations ngos oems and retailers to help manage ewaste including electronic products nearing the end of their useful lives and to promote recycling the european union requires producers of certain electrical and electronic equipment to develop programs that let consumers return products for recycling many us states and countries in latin america and asia also have or are developing similar ewaste takeback laws although these laws are typically targeted at the end electronic product and not the component products that we manufacture the inconsistency of many ewaste takeback laws and the lack of local ewaste management options in many areas pose a challenge for our compliance efforts 

we are an industry leader in our efforts to build ethical sourcing of minerals for our products including conflict minerals from the democratic republic of the congo drc and adjoining countries in 2013 we accomplished our goal to manufacture microprocessors that are drc conflictfree for tantalum tin tungsten and gold we continue our work to establish drc conflictfree supply chains for our company and our industry and have set a new goal that all products currently on our roadmap for 2016 and beyond will be drc conflictfree for these four minerals 

we seek to reduce our global greenhouse gas emissions by investing in energy conservation projects in our factories and working with suppliers to improve energy efficiency we take a holistic approach to power management addressing the challenge at the silicon package circuit microarchitecture macroarchitecture platform and software levels we recognize that climate change may cause general economic risk for further information on the risks of climate change see risk factors in part i item 1a of this form 10k we see a potential for higher energy costs driven by climate change regulations this could include items applied to utility companies that are passed along to customers such as carbon taxes or costs associated with obtaining permits for our manufacturing operations emission cap and trade programs or renewable portfolio standards 

we are committed to sustainability and take a leadership position in promoting voluntary environmental initiatives and working proactively with governments environmental groups and industry to promote global environmental sustainability we believe that technology will be fundamental to finding solutions to the world’s environmental challenges and we are joining forces with industry business and governments to find and promote ways that technology can be used as a tool to combat climate change 

we have been purchasing renewable energy at some of our major sites for several years we purchase renewable energy certificates under a multiyear contract this purchase has placed intel at the top of the epa’s green power partnership for the past seven years and is intended to help stimulate the market for green power leading to additional generating capacity and ultimately lower costs 

distribution of company information 

our internet address is wwwintelcom  we publish voluntary reports on our website that outline our performance with respect to corporate responsibility including ehs compliance 

we use our investor relations website wwwintccom  as a routine channel for distribution of important information including news releases analyst presentations and financial information we post filings on our website the same day they are electronically filed with or furnished to the us securities and exchange commission sec including our annual and quarterly reports on forms 10k and 10q and current reports on form 8k our proxy statements and any amendments to those reports or statements we post our quarterly and annual earnings results on our investor relations website wwwintccomresultscfm  and do not distribute our financial results via a news wire service all such postings and filings are available on our investor relations website free of charge in addition our investor relations website allows interested persons to sign up to automatically receive email alerts when we post news releases and financial information the sec’s website wwwsecgov  contains reports proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the sec the content on any website referred to in this form 10k is not incorporated by reference in this form 10k unless expressly noted

risk factors 

tableend the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our common stock could decline these risk factors do not identify all risks that we face our operations could also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations due to risks and uncertainties known and unknown our past financial results may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods you should also refer to the other information set forth in this annual report including management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and our financial statements and the related notes 

changes in product demand can harm our results of operation and financial condition 

demand for our products is variable and hard to predict   

changes in the demand for our products may reduce our revenue increase our costs lower our gross margin percentage or require us to write down the value of our assets important factors that could lead to variation in the demand for our products include changes in 

 we face significant competition   

the industry in which we operate is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological and market developments changes in industry standards changes in customer needs and frequent product introductions and improvements if we do not anticipate and respond to these developments our competitive position may weaken and our products or technologies might be uncompetitive or obsolete over recent years our business focus has expanded and now includes the design and production of platforms for tablets smartphones and other devices across the compute continuum including products for the internet of things and related services as a result we face new sources of competition including in certain of these market segments from incumbent competitors with established customer bases and greater brand recognition to be successful we need to cultivate new industry relationships with customers and partners in these market segments in addition we must continually improve the cost integration and energy efficiency of our products as well as expand our software capabilities to provide customers with comprehensive computing solutions despite our ongoing efforts there is no guarantee that we will achieve or maintain consumer and market acceptance for our products and services in these various market segments 

to compete successfully we must maintain a successful rd effort develop new products and production processes and improve our existing products and processes ahead of competitors for example we invest substantially in our network of manufacturing and assembly and test facilities including the construction of new fabrication facilities to support smaller transistor geometries and larger wafers our rd efforts are critical to our success and are aimed at solving complex problems and we do not expect all of our projects to be successful we may be unable to develop and market new products successfully and the products we invest in and develop may not be wellreceived by customers our rd investments may not generate significant operating income or contribute to our future operating results for several years and such contributions may not meet our expectations or even cover the costs of such investments additionally the products and technologies offered by others may affect demand for or pricing of our products 

if we are not able to compete effectively our financial results will be adversely affected including increased costs and reduced revenue and gross margin and we may be required to accelerate the writedown of the value of certain assets 

changes in the mix of products sold may harm our financial results 

prices differ widely among the platforms we offer in our various market segments due to differences in features offered or manufacturing costs for example product offerings range from lowerpriced and entrylevel platforms such as those based on intel quark or intel atom processors to higherend platforms based on intel xeon and intel itanium processors if there is a shift in demand from our higherpriced to lowerpriced platforms in any of our market segments our gross margin and revenue would decrease in addition when products are initially introduced they tend to have higher costs because of initial development costs and lower production volumes relative to the previous product generation which can impact gross margin 

we operate globally and are subject to significant risks in many jurisdictions 

global or regional conditions may harm our financial results 

we have manufacturing assembly and test rd sales and other operations in many countries and some of our business activities may be concentrated in one or more geographic areas moreover sales outside the us accounted for approximately 82  of our revenue for the fiscal year ended december 27 2014 as a result our operations and our financial results including our ability to manufacture assemble and test design develop or sell products may be adversely affected by a number of factors outside of our control including 

 although we have policies controls and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws there can be no assurance that our employees contractors suppliers andor agents will not violate such laws or our policies violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation 

we may be affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in currency exchange rates although most of our sales occur in us dollars expenses may be paid in local currencies an increase in the value of the dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the us where we sell in dollars and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of expenses such as payroll utilities tax and marketing expenses as well as overseas capital expenditures we also conduct certain investing and financing activities in local currencies our hedging programs reduce but do not eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements therefore changes in exchange rates could harm our results of operations and financial condition 

catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results 

our operations or systems could be disrupted by natural disasters geopolitical conditions terrorist activity public health issues cybersecurity incidents interruptions of service from utilities transportation or telecommunications providers or other catastrophic events such events could make it difficult or impossible to manufacture or deliver products to our customers receive production materials from our suppliers or perform critical functions which could adversely affect our revenue and require significant recovery time and expenditures to resume operations while we maintain business recovery plans that are intended to allow us to recover from natural disasters or other events that can be disruptive to our business some of our systems are not fully redundant and we cannot be sure that our plans will fully protect us from all such disruptions 

we maintain a program of insurance coverage for a variety of property casualty and other risks we place our insurance coverage with multiple carriers in numerous jurisdictions however one or more of our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim the types and amounts of insurance we obtain vary depending on availability cost and decisions with respect to risk retention the policies have deductibles and exclusions that result in us retaining a level of selfinsurance losses not covered by insurance may be large which could harm our results of operations and financial condition 

we operate our own fabrication facilities and as a result are vulnerable to manufacturingrelated risks 

due to the variability in demand for our products we may be unable to timely respond to reduce costs when demand declines or to increase production when demand increases 

our operations have high costs that are either fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term including our costs related to manufacturing such as facility construction and equipment rd and the employment and training of a highly skilled workforce if product demand decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately we could be required to write off inventory or record excess capacity charges which would lower our gross margin our manufacturing or assembly and test capacity could be underutilized and we may be required to write down our longlived assets which would increase our expenses factoryplanning decisions may shorten the useful lives of facilities and equipment and cause us to accelerate depreciation 

conversely if product demand increases we may be unable to add capacity fast enough to meet market demand our revenue and gross margin can also be affected by the timing of our product introductions and related expenses including marketing expenses 

we are subject to risks associated with the development and implementation of new manufacturing process technology 

we may not be successful or efficient in developing or implementing new production processes production of integrated circuits is a complex process we are continually engaged in the transition from our existing process to the nextgeneration process technology this consistent innovation involves significant expense and carries inherent risks including difficulties in designing and developing nextgeneration process technologies development and production timing delays lower than anticipated manufacturing yields and product defects and errata disruptions in the production process can also result from errors defects in materials interruption in our supply of materials or resources and disruptions at our fabrication and assembly and test facilities due to accidents maintenance issues or unsafe working conditions—all of which could affect the timing of production ramps and yields production issues can lead to increased costs and may affect our ability to meet product demand which could adversely impact our business and the results from operations 

we face supply chain risks 

we have thousands of suppliers providing materials that we use in production and other aspects of our business where possible we seek to have several sources of supply for all of those materials however for certain materials we may rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers or upon suppliers in a single location in addition consolidation among suppliers could impact the nature quality availability and pricing of the products and services available to us the inability of suppliers to deliver adequate supplies of production materials or other supplies could disrupt our production processes or make it more difficult for us to implement our business strategy production could be disrupted by the unavailability of resources used in production such as water silicon electricity gases and other materials the unavailability or reduced availability of materials or resources may require us to reduce production or incur additional costs which could harm our business and results of operations 

we also rely on thirdparty providers to manufacture assemble and test certain components or products particularly for our networking mobile and communications and nand flash memory businesses if any of these third parties are unable to perform these services on a timely basis we may encounter supply delays or disruptions that could adversely affect our financial results 

in addition there are regulatory and other requirements restrictions and requests from various constituencies regarding sourcing practices and supplier conduct with a trend toward expanding the scope of materials and locations where materials originate regulating supplier behaviors and increasing the required disclosures regarding such matters by public companies increased regulation and public pressure in this area would cause our compliance costs to increase and could negatively affect our reputation given that we use many materials in the manufacturing of our products and rely on many suppliers to provide these materials but do not directly control their procurement or employment practices 

we are subject to the risks of product defects and errata 

product defects and errata deviations from published specifications may result from problems in our product design or our manufacturing and assembly and test processes costs from defects and errata could include 

 these costs could be large and may increase expenses and lower gross margin and result in delay or loss of revenue our reputation with customers or end users could be damaged as a result of product defects and errata and product demand could be reduced the announcement of product defects and errata could cause customers to purchase products from competitors as a result of possible shortages of our components or for other reasons any of these occurrences could harm our business and financial results 

we are subject to risks associated with environmental laws and regulations 

the manufacturing and assembly and test of our products require the use of hazardous materials that are subject to a broad array of ehs laws and regulations our failure to comply with these laws or regulations could result in 

 our failure to manage the use transportation emissions discharge storage recycling or disposal of hazardous materials could lead to increased costs or future liabilities our ability to grow or modify our manufacturing capability in the future may be impeded by environmental regulations such as air quality and wastewater requirements environmental laws and regulations could also require us to acquire pollution abatement or remediation equipment modify product designs or incur other expenses many new materials that we are evaluating for use in our operations may be subject to regulation under environmental laws and regulations these restrictions could harm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter manufacturing and assembly and test processes 

climate change may also pose regulatory and environmental risks that could harm our results of operations and affect the way we conduct business for example climate change regulation could result in increased manufacturing costs associated with air pollution control requirements and increased or new monitoring recordkeeping and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions we also see the potential for higher energy costs driven by climate change regulations if for example utility companies pass on their costs to their customers furthermore many of our operations are located in semiarid regions that may become increasingly vulnerable to prolonged droughts due to climate change our fabrication facilities have significant water use and while we recycle and reuse a portion of the water used we may have difficulties obtaining sufficient water to fulfill our operational needs due the lack of available infrastructure 

we are subject to ip risks and risks associated with litigation and regulatory proceedings 

we may be unable to enforce or protect our ip rights 

we regard our patents copyrights trade secrets and other ip rights as important to the success of our business we rely on ip law as well as confidentiality and licensing agreements with our customers employees technology development partners and others to protect our ip rights our ability to enforce these rights is subject to general litigation risks as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our ip rights in various countries when we seek to enforce our rights we may be subject to claims that the ip rights are invalid not enforceable or licensed to the opposing party our assertion of ip rights may result in the other party seeking to assert claims against us which could harm our business governments may adopt regulations—and governments or courts may render decisions—requiring compulsory licensing of ip rights or governments may require products to meet standards that serve to favor local companies our inability to enforce our ip rights under any of these circumstances may harm our competitive position and business in addition the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products as a result the value of our investment in rd product development and marketing could be reduced 

our licenses with other companies and participation in industry initiatives may allow competitors to use our patent rights 

companies in our industry often bilaterally license patents between each other to settle disputes or as part of business agreements our competitors may have licenses to our patents and under current case law some of the licenses may exhaust our patent rights as to licensed product sales under some circumstances our participation in industry standards organizations or with other industry initiatives may require us to license our patents to companies that adopt industrystandard specifications depending on the rules of the organization we might have to grant these licenses to our patents for little or no cost and as a result we may be unable to enforce certain patents against others our costs of enforcing our licenses or protecting our patents may increase and the value of our ip rights may be impaired 

third parties may assert claims based on ip rights against us or our products which could harm our business 

we may face claims based on ip rights from individuals and companies including those who have acquired patent portfolios to assert claims against other companies we are normally engaged in a number of litigation matters involving ip rights claims that our products or processes infringe the ip rights of others whether or not meritorious could cause us to incur large costs to respond to defend and resolve the claims and they may divert the efforts and attention of management and technical personnel in addition we may face claims based on the theft or unauthorized use or disclosure of thirdparty trade secrets and other confidential business information or enduser data that we obtain in conducting our business any such incidents and claims could severely disrupt our business and we could suffer losses including the cost of product recalls and returns and reputational harm furthermore we have agreed to indemnify customers for certain ip rights claims against them as a result of ip rights claims we could 

 these ip rights claims could harm our competitive position result in expenses or require us to impair our assets if we alter or stop production of affected items our revenue could be harmed 

we rely on access to thirdparty ip which may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

many of our products include thirdparty ip andor implement industry standards which may require licenses from third parties based on past experience and industry practice we believe such licenses generally can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms however there is no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all failure to obtain the right to use thirdparty ip or to use such ip on commercially reasonable terms could preclude us from selling certain products or otherwise have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results 

we are subject to the risks associated with litigation and regulatory proceedings 

we may face legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder consumer competition and other issues on a global basis as described in  note 25 contingencies  in part ii item 8 of this form 10k we are engaged in a number of litigation and regulatory matters litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain and adverse rulings could occur including monetary damages or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products engaging in certain business practices or requiring other remedies such as compulsory licensing of patents an unfavorable outcome may result in a material adverse impact on our business results of operations financial position and overall trends in addition regardless of the outcome litigation can be costly timeconsuming disruptive to our operations and distracting to management 

we must attract retain and motivate key employees 

to be competitive we must attract retain and motivate executives and other key employees hiring and retaining qualified executives scientists engineers technical staff and sales representatives are critical to our business and competition for experienced employees can be intense to help attract retain and motivate qualified employees we use sharebased and other performancebased incentive awards such as restricted stock units and cash bonuses if our sharebased or other compensation programs cease to be viewed as competitive and valuable benefits our ability to attract retain and motivate employees could be weakened which could harm our results of operations 

we are subject to cybersecurity and privacy risks 

third parties might attempt to gain unauthorized access to our network or seek to compromise our products and services 

we regularly face attempts by others to gain unauthorized access through the internet or to introduce malicious software to our information technology it systems additionally malicious hackers may attempt to gain unauthorized access and corrupt the processes of hardware and software products that we manufacture and services we provide due to the widespread use of our products and due to the high profile of our mcafee subsidiary we or our products and services are a frequent target of computer hackers and organizations that intend to sabotage take control of or otherwise corrupt our manufacturing or other processes products and services we are also a target of malicious attackers who attempt to gain access to our network or data centers or those of our customers or end users steal proprietary information related to our business products employees and customers or interrupt our systems and services or those of our customers or others we believe such attempts are increasing in number and in technical sophistication from time to time we encounter intrusions or attempts at gaining unauthorized access to our products services and network to date none have resulted in any material adverse impact to our business or operations in some instances we our customers and the users of our products and services might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects while we seek to detect and investigate all unauthorized attempts and attacks against our network products and services and to prevent their recurrence where practicable through changes to our internal processes and tools andor changes or patches to our products and services we remain potentially vulnerable to additional known or unknown threats such incidents whether successful or unsuccessful could result in our incurring significant costs related to for example rebuilding internal systems reduced inventory value providing modifications to our products and services defending against litigation responding to regulatory inquiries or actions paying damages or taking other remedial steps with respect to third parties in addition these threats are constantly evolving thereby increasing the difficulty of successfully defending against them or implementing adequate preventative measures publicity about vulnerabilities and attempted or successful incursions could damage our reputation with customers or users and reduce demand for our products and services 

we may be subject to theft loss or misuse of personal data about our employees customers or other third parties which could increase our expenses damage our reputation or result in legal or regulatory proceedings 

the theft loss or misuse of personal data collected used stored or transferred by us to run our business could result in significantly increased security costs or costs related to defending legal claims global privacy legislation enforcement and policy activity in this area are rapidly expanding and creating a complex compliance regulatory environment costs to comply with and implement these privacyrelated and data protection measures could be significant in addition our even inadvertent failure to comply with federal state or international privacyrelated or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others 

we are subject to risks associated with strategic transactions 

we invest in companies for strategic reasons and may not realize a return on our investments 

we make investments in public and private companies around the world to further our strategic objectives and support key business initiatives many of the securities in which we invest are nonmarketable at the time of our initial investment companies in which we invest range from earlystage companies still defining their strategic direction to mature companies with established revenue streams and business models the success of our investment in any company is typically dependent on the availability to the company of additional funding on favorable terms or a liquidity event such as a public offering or acquisition if any of the companies in which we invest fail we could lose all or part of our investment if we determine that an otherthantemporary decline in the fair value exists for an investment we write down the investment to its fair value and recognize a loss 

our acquisitions divestitures and other transactions could fail to achieve strategic objectives disrupt our ongoing business and harm our results of operations   

in pursuing our business strategy we routinely conduct discussions evaluate opportunities and enter into agreements for possible acquisitions divestitures and other transactions such as joint ventures given that our resources are limited our decision to complete an acquisition has opportunity costs and we may need to forego the prospect of acquiring other companies or technologies that could help us achieve our strategic objectives in addition to opportunity costs these transactions involve large challenges and risks including risks that 

 when we decide to sell assets or a business we may have difficulty selling on acceptable terms in a timely manner and the agreedupon terms and financing arrangements could be renegotiated due to changes in business or market conditions these circumstances could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives or cause us to incur additional expense or we may sell a business at a price or on terms that are less favorable than we had anticipated resulting in a loss on the transaction 

if we do enter into agreements with respect to acquisitions divestitures or other transactions we may fail to complete them due to factors such as 

 we are subject to salesrelated risks 

we face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties 

we sell a significant portion   of our products through third parties such as distributors valueadded resellers oems internet service providers and channel partners collectively referred to as distributors using third parties for distribution exposes us to many risks including competitive pressure concentration credit risk and compliance risks distributors may sell products that compete with our products and we may need to provide financial and other incentives to focus distributors on the sale of our products we may rely on one or more key distributors for a product and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue distributors may face financial difficulties including bankruptcy which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and financial results violations of the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa or similar laws by distributors or other thirdparty intermediaries could have a material impact on our business failure to manage risks related to our use of distributors may reduce sales increase expenses and weaken our competitive position 

we face risks related to business transactions with us government entities 

we receive proceeds from services and products we provide to the us government us government demand and payment may be affected by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations us government contracts are subject to oversight including special rules on accounting ip rights expenses reviews information handling and security failure to comply with these rules could result in civil and criminal penalties and sanctions including termination of contracts fines and suspensions or debarment from future us government business 

our results of operations could vary as a result of the methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying accounting policies 

the methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying accounting policies have a large impact on our results of operations for more information see critical accounting estimates in part ii item 7 of this form 10k these methods estimates and judgments are subject to large risks uncertainties and assumptions and changes could affect our results of operations 

changes in our effective tax rate may reduce our net income 

a number of factors may increase our effective tax rates which could reduce our net income including   

 we may have fluctuations in the amount and frequency of our stock repurchases 

the amount timing and other execution of our stock repurchase program may fluctuate based on our priorities for the use of cash for other purposes such as investing in our business including operational spending capital spending and acquisitions and returning cash to our stockholders as dividend payments and because of changes in cash flows and changes in tax laws 

workforce restructuring actions may be disruptive to our operations and adversely affect our financial results 

in response to the business environment and to accomplish our strategic objectives from time to time we may restructure our operations or make other adjustments to our workforce such workforce changes can result in restructuring charges in addition to those described in  note 13 restructuring and asset impairment charges  in part ii item 8 of this form 10k such workforce changes can also temporarily reduce workforce productivity which could be disruptive to our business and adversely affect our results of operations in addition we may not achieve or sustain the expected cost savings or other benefits of our restructuring plans or do so within the expected time frame 

there are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of our controls 

we do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how welldesigned and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met the design of a control system must reflect the fact that resource constraints exist and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks over time controls may become inadequate due to changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures if our controls become inadequate we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations our reputation may be adversely affected our business and operating results could be harmed and the market price of our stock could decline

common stock repurchase activity under our stock repurchase plan during the fourth quarter of 2014  was as follows 



in the fourth quarter of 2014 we entered into a stock repurchase agreement a portion of which was executed as a forward contract we received collateral from the counterparty for the value attributable to the forward portion of this contract and invested the collateral into permitted investments considered restricted from other uses as of december 27 2014 325 million  of collateral which approximates fair value remains recorded as both a current asset and current liability on the consolidated balance sheet the 325 million  represents the unsettled portion of the contract and was returned to the counterparty on december 29 2014 the settlement date 

in our consolidated financial statements we also treat shares of common stock withheld for tax purposes on behalf of our employees in connection with the vesting of restricted stock units as common stock repurchases because they reduce the number of shares that would have been issued upon vesting these withheld shares are not considered common stock repurchases under our authorized common stock repurchase plan  and accordingly are not included in the common stock repurchase totals in the preceding table

overview 

our results of operations for each period were as follows 

our results for q4 2014  were a strong finish to a great year we achieved record net revenue of 147 billion  up   6  from q4 2013  we achieved increased net revenue and unit sales growth in the pccg segment with net revenue up   3  and operating profit up 18  from q4 2013  dcg achieved 25  net revenue growth and 39  operating income growth from q4 2013  we saw a moderate increase in net inventory levels from q3 2014 as we are efficiently managing capacity while ramping our 5th generation intel core processor family on 14nm codenamed broadwell the worldwide pc supply chain appears to be healthy with inventory levels appropriate as we enter q1 2015  

gross margin improved by approximately three and a half percentage points from q4 2013  the increase from q4 2013  was primarily due to lower factory startup costs lower pccg and dcg platform platform unit costs higher platform average selling prices and higher platform unit sales these items were partially offset by the impact of higher cash consideration associated with our tablet platform and higher production costs on our 14nm products treated as period charges 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

for full year 2014  we achieved record net revenue of 559 billion  up   6  from 2013 operating income of 153 billion  up   25  from 2013 and diluted earnings per share of 231  up 22  from 2013 both our pccg and dcg businesses outperformed our expectations for the year pccg net revenue was up   4  with pccg platform unit sales up   8  primarily on higher notebook platform unit sales we saw robust growth in dcg with net revenue up   18  and platform average selling prices and unit sales up 10 and 8  respectively gross margin of approximately 64  was up approximately four points from 2013  driven by lower platform unit costs lower startup costs and higher platform volumes these increases were partially offset by higher cost of sales associated with higher tablet platform unit sales and cash consideration provided to our customers associated with integrating our tablet platform 

in 2014  we started growing again across a broad range of products and markets by introducing many new product technologies across all of our businesses we began shipping the worlds first processor on 14nm process technology additionally we launched a new family of processors intel core m intel core m processor is enabling new designs and form factors with its full core performance in both compute and graphics we recently launched intel realsense technology which includes software and depth cameras that enable more natural and intuitive interaction with personal computing devices in the wireless business we qualified our first soc application processor and baseband 3g solution codenamed sofia we also exceeded our goal of 40 million tablet platform unit sales in 2014 

the cash generation from our business remained strong with cash from operations of 204 billion  in 2014  we ended the year with an investment portfolio of 141 billion down approximately 60 billion from a year ago our investment portfolio consisted of cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and trading assets we purchased 101 billion  in capital assets down from our prior outlook of 110 billion as we found efficiencies optimized our manufacturing network and increased our factory utilization in addition we returned 44 billion  to stockholders through dividends and repurchased 108 billion  of common stock through our common stock repurchase program our board of directors authorized an increase of 20 billion to the common stock repurchase program effective in q1 2015 our annual dividend increased to 096 per share and our board of directors declared a cash dividend of 024  per share of common stock 

looking ahead to 2015  we are forecasting revenue to grow in the midsingle digits and the midpoint of our gross margin range to be at 62 plus or minus a couple of points additionally we are forecasting rd and mga spending to be approximately 200 billion plus or minus 400 million and forecasting capital spending of 100 billion plus or minus 500 million for q1 2015  we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range to be 137 billion plus or minus 500 million down approximately 7 from q4 2014  this forecast is in line with the average seasonal decline for the first quarter we are forecasting the midpoint of the gross margin range for the first quarter to be 60 plus or minus a couple of points 

our business outlook for q1 2015  and full year 2015  includes where applicable our current expectations for revenue gross margin percentage spending rd plus mga and capital expenditures we publish our business outlook in our quarterly earnings release 

our business outlook and any updates thereto are publicly available on our investor relations website wwwintccom  this business outlook is not incorporated by reference in this form 10k we expect that our corporate representatives will from time to time meet publicly or privately with investors and others and may reiterate the forwardlooking statements contained in the business outlook or in this form 10k the statements in the business outlook and forwardlooking statements in this form 10k are subject to revision during the course of the year in our quarterly earnings releases and sec filings and at other times the forwardlooking statements in the business outlook will be effective through the close of business on march 13 2015 unless updated earlier from the close of business on march 13 2015 until our quarterly earnings release is published currently scheduled for april 14 2015 we will observe a quiet period during the quiet period the business outlook and other forwardlooking statements first published in our form 8k filed on january 15 2015 and other forwardlooking statements disclosed in the companys news releases and filings with the sec as reiterated or updated as applicable in this form 10k should be considered historical speaking as of prior to the quiet period only and not subject to update during the quiet period our representatives will not comment on our business outlook or our financial results or expectations the exact timing and duration of the routine quiet period and any others that we utilize from time to time may vary at our discretion

critical accounting estimates 

the methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our consolidated financial statements some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain our most critical accounting estimates include 

 in the following section we discuss these policies further as well as the estimates and judgments involved 

nonmarketable equity investments 

we regularly invest in nonmarketable equity instruments of private companies which range from earlystage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models the carrying value of our nonmarketable equity investment portfolio excluding equity derivatives totaled 32 billion  as of december 27 2014   23 billion  as of december 28 2013  

our nonmarketable equity investments are recorded using the cost method or the equity method of accounting depending on the facts and circumstances of each investment our nonmarketable equity investments are classified within other longterm assets on the consolidated balance sheets 

nonmarketable equity investments are inherently risky and their success depends on product development market acceptance operational efficiency and other key business factors the companies could fail or not be able to raise additional funds when needed or they may receive lower valuations with less favorable investment terms than previous financings these events could cause our investments to become impaired in addition financial market volatility could negatively affect our ability to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings mergers and private sales for further information about our investment portfolio risks see risk factors in part i item 1a of this form 10k 

we determine the fair value of our nonmarketable equity investments portfolio quarterly for impairment and disclosure purposes however the investments are recorded at fair value only if an impairment is recognized the measurement of fair value requires significant judgment and includes a qualitative and quantitative analysis of events or circumstances that impact the fair value of the investment qualitative analysis of our investments involves understanding our investee’s revenue and earnings trends relative to predefined milestones and overall business prospects the technological feasibility of our investee’s products and technologies the general market conditions in the investee’s industry or geographic area including adverse regulatory or economic changes and the management and governance structure of the investee quantitative assessments of the fair value of our investments are developed using the market and income approaches the market approach includes the use of financial metrics and ratios of comparable public companies such as revenue earnings comparable performance multiples recent financing rounds the terms of the investees’ issued interests and the level of marketability of the investments the selection of comparable companies requires management judgment and is based on a number of factors including comparable companies’ sizes growth rates industries and development stages the income approach includes the use of a discounted cash flow model which requires significant estimates regarding the investees revenue costs and discount rates based on the risk profile of comparable companies estimates of revenue and costs are developed using available market historical and forecast data 

if the fair value of an investment is below our carrying value we determine whether the investment is otherthantemporarily impaired based on our quantitative and qualitative analysis which includes assessing the severity and duration of the impairment and the likelihood of recovery before disposal if the investment is considered to be otherthantemporarily impaired we record the investment at fair value by recognizing an impairment impairments of nonmarketable equity investments were 140 million  in 2014   112 million  in 2013  and 104 million  in 2012  

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

longlived assets 

property plant and equipment 

we assess property plant and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant underperformance of a business or product line in relation to expectations significant negative industry or economic trends and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets we measure the recoverability of assets that we will continue to use in our operations by comparing the carrying value of the asset grouping to our estimate of the related total future undiscounted net cash flows if an asset grouping’s carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows the asset grouping is considered to be impaired we measure the impairment by comparing the difference between the asset grouping’s carrying value and its fair value property plant and equipment is considered a nonfinancial asset and is recorded at fair value only if an impairment charge is recognized 

impairments are determined for groups of assets related to the lowest level of identifiable independent cash flows due to our asset usage model and the interchangeable nature of our semiconductor manufacturing capacity we must make subjective judgments in determining the independent cash flows that can be related to specific asset groupings in addition as we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions we must make subjective judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets primarily processspecific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements when we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated we accelerate the rate of depreciation over the assets’ new shorter useful lives based on our analysis impairments and accelerated depreciation of our property plant and equipment was 115 million  in 2014   172 million  in 2013  and 73 million  in 2012  

goodwill 

goodwill is recorded when the purchase price of an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired goodwill is allocated to our reporting units based on the relative expected fair value provided by the acquisition reporting units may be operating segments as a whole or an operation one level below an operating segment referred to as a component our reporting units are consistent with the operating segments identified in  note 26 operating segments and geographic information  in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

we perform an annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist  to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit in which goodwill resides is less than its carrying value for reporting units in which this assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than its carrying value goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test qualitative factors considered in this assessment include industry and market considerations overall financial performance and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit additionally as part of this assessment we may perform a quantitative analysis to support the qualitative factors above by applying sensitivities to assumptions and inputs used in measuring a reporting unit’s fair value for reporting units in which the impairment assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying value we perform the first step of the goodwill impairment test which compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform additional analysis if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit then we must perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill if we determine during the second step that the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value we record an impairment loss equal to the difference 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions our goodwill impairment test uses a weighting of the income method and the market method to estimate a reporting unit’s fair value the income method is based on a discounted future cash flow approach that uses the following assumptions and inputs revenue based on assumed market segment growth rates and our assumed market segment share estimated costs and appropriate discount rates based on a reporting units weighted average cost of capital as determined by considering the observable weighted average cost of capital of comparable companies our estimates of market segment growth our market segment share and costs are based on historical data various internal estimates and a variety of external sources these estimates are developed as part of our routine longrange planning process the same estimates are also used in planning for our longterm manufacturing and assembly and test capacity needs as part of our capital budgeting process and for longterm and shortterm business planning and forecasting we test the reasonableness of the inputs and outcomes of our discounted cash flow analysis against available comparable market data the market method is based on financial multiples of comparable companies and applies a control premium a reporting unit’s carrying value represents the assignment of various assets and liabilities excluding certain corporate assets and liabilities such as cash investments and debt 

for the annual impairment assessment in 2014  we determined that for each of our reporting units it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units exceeded the carrying value as a result we concluded that performing the first step of the goodwill impairment test was not necessary for any reporting unit during the fourth quarter of each of the prior three fiscal years we have completed our annual impairment assessments and concluded that goodwill was not impaired in any of these years 

identified intangibles 

we make judgments about the recoverability of purchased finitelived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist recoverability of finitelived intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate we perform an annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each year for indefinitelived intangible assets or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist to determine whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable recoverability of indefinitelived intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future discounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate if we determine that an individual asset is impaired the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset 

the assumptions and estimates used to determine future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible and other longlived assets are complex and subjective they can be affected by various factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our forecasts for specific product lines based on our impairment assessment we recognized impairment charges of 36 million  in 2014   17 million  in 2013  and 21 million  in 2012  

income taxes 

we must make estimates and judgments in determining the provision for taxes for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes as well as the interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions significant changes in these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 

we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets if recovery is not more likely than not we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable we believe that we will ultimately recover the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets however should a change occur in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery is not more likely than not recovery of a portion of our deferred tax assets is impacted by management’s plans with respect to holding or disposing of certain investments therefore changes in management’s plans with respect to holding or disposing of investments could affect our future provision for taxes 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a twostep process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining whether the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any if we determine that a tax position will more likely than not be sustained on audit the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50  likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and may not accurately forecast actual outcomes determining whether an uncertain tax position is effectively settled requires judgment such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 

we have not recognized us deferred income taxes on certain undistributed nonus earnings because we plan to indefinitely reinvest such earnings outside the us remittances of nonus earnings are based on estimates and judgments of projected cash flow needs as well as the working capital and investment requirements of our nonus and us operations material changes in our estimates of cash working capital and investment needs in the various jurisdictions could require repatriation of indefinitely reinvested nonus earnings which would be subject to us income taxes and applicable nonus income and withholding taxes 

inventory 

intel has a product development lifecycle that corresponds with substantive engineering milestones these engineering milestones are regularly and consistently applied in assessing the point at which our activities and associated costs change in nature from rd to cost of sales in order for a product to be manufactured in high volumes and sold to our customers under our standard warranty it must meet our rigorous technical quality specifications this milestone is known as product release qualification prq we have identified prq as the point at which the costs incurred to manufacture our products are included in the valuation of inventory 

to determine which costs can be included in the valuation of inventory we must determine normal capacity at our manufacturing and assembly and test facilities based on historical loadings compared to total available capacity if the factory loadings are below the established normal capacity level a portion of our manufacturing overhead costs would not be included in the cost of inventory therefore it would be recognized as cost of sales in that period which would negatively impact our gross margin we refer to these costs as excess capacity charges excess capacity charges were zero  in 2014   319 million  in 2013  and 540 million  in 2012  

inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions productspecific facts and circumstances reviewed in the inventory valuation process include a review of our customer base the stage of the product life cycle of our products consumer confidence customer acceptance of our products and an assessment of selling price in relation to product cost if the estimated market value of the inventory is less than the carrying value we write down the inventory and record the difference as a charge to cost of sales inventory reserves increased by approximately 290 million  in 2014  compared to 2013  this increase was driven primarily by higher production costs on 14nm treated as period charges and prequalification product costs these increases were partially offset by the sellthrough of writtendown inventory and previously nonqualified units 

the valuation of inventory also requires us to estimate obsolete and excess inventory as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality the demand forecast is utilized in the development of our shortterm manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuation and build decisions the estimate of future demand is compared to workinprocess and finished goods inventory levels to determine the amount if any of obsolete or excess inventory if our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly we could be required to write off inventory which would negatively impact our gross margin 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

loss contingencies 

we are subject to loss contingencies including various legal and regulatory proceedings and asserted and potential claims accruals related to repair or replacement of parts in connection with product errata as well as product warranties and potential asset impairments that arise in the ordinary course of business an estimated loss from such contingencies is recognized as a charge to income if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated disclosure of a loss contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a material loss has been incurred the outcomes of legal and administrative proceedings and claims and the estimation of product warranties and asset impairments are subject to significant uncertainty significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether a loss is reasonably estimable at least quarterly we review the status of each significant matter and we may revise our estimates these revisions could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 

results of operations 

certain consolidated statements of income data as a percentage of net revenue for each period were as follows 

our net revenue for   2014   increased   by   32 billion  or   6  compared to   2013  pccg and dcg platform unit sales increased by   8  driven by strength in the traditional pc business and the data center market segments to a lesser extent higher nonvolatile memory solutions group revenue and higher iotg platform unit   sales contributed to the increase these increases were partially offset by higher cash consideration to our customers associated with integrating our tablet platform and lower mcg phone component unit sales 

our overall gross margin dollars for 2014   increased  by 41 billion  or 13  compared to 2013  this increase was due primarily to higher pccg and dcg platform revenue to a lesser extent approximately 15 billion of lower pccg and dcg platform unit costs and approximately 860 million of lower factory startup costs primarily driven by our nextgeneration 14nm process technology also contributed to the increase these increases were partially offset by approximately 660 million of higher cash consideration provided to customers associated with integrating our tablet platform and higher cost of sales associated with higher tablet platform unit sales 

our overall gross margin percentage increased to 637  in 2014  from 598  in 2013  the increase in gross margin percentage was primarily due to the gross margin increase in pccg and dcg we derived most of our overall gross margin dollars for 2014  and 2013  from the sale of platforms in the pccg and dcg operating segments 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

our net revenue for 2013   decreased  by 633 million  or 1  compared to 2012  pccg and dcg platform unit sales decreased by 3  additionally lower mcg phone component revenue and netbook platform revenue contributed to the decrease these decreases were partially offset by higher pccg and dcg platform average selling prices which were up   3  to a lesser extent higher iotg platform average selling prices and higher nonvolatile memory solutions group revenue offset the decrease in revenue 

our overall gross margin dollars for 2013   decreased  by 16 billion  or 5  compared to 2012  the decrease was due in large part to 18 billion of higher factory startup costs primarily for our nextgeneration 14nm process technology to a lesser extent lower mcg phone components revenue and lower netbook platform revenue contributed to the decrease these decreases were partially offset by approximately 320 million of lower pccg and dcg platform unit costs and 220 million of lower excess capacity charges 

our overall gross margin percentage decreased to 598  in 2013  from 621  in 2012  the decrease in the gross margin percentage was primarily due to the gross margin percentage decrease in pccg we derived most of our overall gross margin dollars in 2013  and 2012  from the sale of platforms in the pccg and dcg operating segments 

pc client group 

the revenue and operating income for the pccg operating segment for each period were as follows 

net revenue for the pccg operating segment increased  by 14 billion  or 4  in 2014  compared to 2013  pccg platform unit sales were up   8  primarily on strength in the traditional pc business while pccg platform average selling prices were down   4  the increase in revenue was driven by higher notebook platform unit sales of 11  to a lesser extent higher desktop platform unit sales of 3  and higher desktop platform average selling prices of 2  also contributed to the increase these increases were partially offset by lower notebook platform average selling prices of 7  

operating income increased  by 29 billion  or 25  in 2014  compared to 2013  driven by 28 billion  of higher gross margin and 109 million  of lower operating expenses the increase in gross margin was driven by approximately 12 billion of lower pccg platform unit costs approximately 930 million of lower factory startup costs primarily driven by our nextgeneration 14nm process technology and higher pccg platform revenue 

net revenue for the pccg operating segment decreased  by 14 billion  or 4  in 2013  compared to 2012  pccg platform unit sales were down 3  primarily on softness in the traditional pc business during the first nine months of the year the decrease in revenue was driven by lower notebook and desktop platform unit sales which were down 4  and 2  respectively pccg platform average selling prices were flat with 6  higher desktop platform average selling prices offset by 4  lower notebook platform average selling prices 

operating income decreased  by 13 billion  or 10  in 2013  compared to 2012  driven by 15 billion  of lower  gross margin  partially offset by   234 million  of lower  operating expenses the decrease in gross margin was driven by 15 billion of higher factory startup costs primarily on our nextgeneration 14nm process technology as well as lower pccg platform revenue these decreases were partially offset by approximately 520 million of lower pccg platform unit costs 260 million of lower excess capacity charges and higher sellthrough of previously nonqualified units

mobile and communications group 

the revenue and operating loss for the mcg operating segment for each period were as follows 



net revenue for the mcg operating segment decreased  by 12 billion  or 85  in 2014  compared to 2013  this decrease was primarily due to higher cash consideration to our customers associated with integrating our tablet and phone platforms and lower phone component unit sales these decreases were partially offset by higher tablet platform unit sales 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

operating loss for the mcg operating segment increased by 11 billion  or 34  in 2014  compared to 2013  with 12 billion  of lower gross margin and 179 million of lower operating expenses the operating loss increased primarily due to higher cash consideration provided to customers higher cost of sales associated with higher tablet platform unit sales and lower phone components revenue these decreases were partially offset by lower tablet unit costs 

net revenue for the mcg operating segment decreased  by 416 million  or 23  in 2013  compared to 2012  this decrease was primarily due to lower phone component unit sales and average selling prices 

operating loss increased  by 14 billion  or 77  in 2013  compared to 2012  driven by 737 million  of lower  gross margin  and   635 million  of higher  operating expenses on rd investments in our smartphone and tablet products as well as higher cost of sales as we ramp our tablet business lower phone components revenue also contributed to the increase in operating loss

net revenue for the ssg operating segments increased by 118 million  in 2013  compared to 2012  the increase was primarily driven by higher mcafee revenue 

the operating results for the ssg operating segments increased by 12 million  in 2013  compared to 2012  the increase was primarily driven by higher mcafee revenue partially offset by higher mcafee operating expenses 

operating expenses 

operating expenses for each period were as follows 

research and development rd spending increased  by 926 million  or 9  in 2014  compared to 2013  the increase  was due to higher process development costs for our 10nm process technology higher compensation expenses for both profitdependent compensation and annual salary increases as well as higher investments in our products primarily server and new devices this increase  was partially offset by lower product investments in our smartphone tablet and intel media businesses 

rd spending increased  by 463 million  or 5  in 2013  compared to 2012  the increase  was driven by higher investments in our products primarily smartphones and tablets as well as higher compensation expenses due to annual salary increases this increase  was partially offset by lower process development costs as we transitioned from rd to manufacturing for our 14nm process technology 

marketing general and administrative mga expenses increased  by 48 million  or 1  in 2014  compared to 2013  mga expenses increased  by 31 million  in 2013  compared to 2012  

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

restructuring and asset impairment charges beginning in q3 2013  management approved several restructuring actions including targeted workforce reductions and the exit of certain businesses and facilities these actions include the wind down of our 200mm wafer fabrication facility in massachusetts which we expect to cease production in q1 2015  and the closure of our assembly and test facility in costa rica which ceased production in q4 2014  these targeted reductions will enable the company to better align our resources in areas providing the greatest benefit in the current business environment  we expect these actions to be substantially complete by the end of   2015  

restructuring and asset impairment charges for each period were as follows 

restructuring and asset impairment activity for each period  was as follows   

we recorded the additional accruals and adjustments as restructuring and asset impairment charges in the consolidated statements of income and within the all other operating segments category a majority of the accrued restructuring balance as of   december 27 2014   is expected to be paid within the next 12 months and was recorded as a current liability within accrued compensation and benefits on the consolidated balance sheets   

restructuring actions that were approved in   2014  impacted approximately 3700  employees since q3 2013  we have incurred a total of 535 million  in restructuring and asset impairment charges these charges included a total of 466 million  related to employee severance and benefit arrangements for approximately 7600  employees and 69 million  in asset impairment charges and other restructuring charges   

we estimate that employee severance and benefit charges to date will result in gross annual savings of approximately 600 million  which will be realized within rd cost of sales and mga we began to realize these savings in q4 2013 and expect to fully realize these savings beginning in q2 2015 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued

gains losses on equity investments and interest and other 

gains losses on equity investments net and interest and other net for each period were as follows 

we recognized lower net gains on equity investments in 2014 compared to 2013 due to lower gains on sales of equity investments partially offset by higher gains on thirdparty merger transactions the majority of gains on sales net for 2014 resulted from gains on private equity sales 

we recognized higher net gains on equity investments in 2013 compared to 2012 due to higher gains on sales of equity investments partially offset by lower gains on thirdparty merger transactions net gains on equity investments for 2013 included gains of 439 million  on the sales of our interest in clearwire communications llc clearwire llc and our shares in clearwire corporation in q3 2013 for further information on these transactions see  note 5 cash and investments  in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

we recognized an interest and other net gain in 2014 compared to a net loss in 2013 due to a gain recognized on the divestiture of our intel media assets in 2014 for further information see  note 9 divestitures  in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

we recognized an interest and other net loss in 2013 compared to a net gain in 2012 we recognized a net loss in 2013 due to an increase in interest expense related to the issuance of our 62 billion  aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes in q4 2012 additionally in q2 2012 we received proceeds from an insurance claim related to the floods in thailand 

provision for taxes 

our provision for taxes and effective tax rate for each period were as follows 

the us rd tax credit was reenacted in q4 2014 retroactive for the full year it was also reenacted in q1 2013 retroactive to the beginning of 2012 a substantial majority of the increase in our effective tax rate between 2014 and 2013 was driven by the reenacted us rd tax credit in 2013 containing two years worth of rd tax credits 

the majority of the decrease in our effective tax rate between 2013 and 2012 was driven by the recognition of the 2012 us rd tax credit in q1 2013 this was partially offset by a lower percentage of our profits generated in lower tax jurisdictions in 2013 compared to 2012

in summary our cash flows for each period were as follows 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

operating activities 

cash provided by  operating activities is net income adjusted for certain noncash items and changes in assets and liabilities 

for 2014  compared to 2013  the 358 million   decrease  in cash provided by operating activities was due to changes in working capital partially offset by higher net income and adjustments for noncash items the adjustments for noncash items were higher due primarily to higher depreciation in 2014 compared to 2013 income taxes paid net of refunds in 2014  compared to 2013  were 18 billion   higher  due to higher income before taxes in 2014 and 2012 income tax overpayments which reduced income taxes paid in 2013 

changes in assets and liabilities as of december 27 2014  compared to december 28 2013  included an income taxes net receivable resulting from income tax settlement payments in 2014 and higher accounts receivable resulting from a higher portion of sales at the end of q4 2014 

for 2014  our three largest customers accounted for 46  of our net revenue  44  in 2013  and 43  in 2012  with hp accounting for 18  of our net revenue  17  in 2013  and 18  in 2012  dell accounting for 16  of our net revenue  15  in 2013  and 14  in 2012  and lenovo accounting for 12  of our net revenue  12  in 2013  and 11  in 2012  these three customers accounted for 43  of our accounts receivable as of december 27 2014   34  as of december 28 2013  

for 2013  compared to 2012  the 19 billion  increase in cash provided by operating activities was due to changes in working capital partially offset by lower net income in 2013 

investing activities 

investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures investment purchases sales maturities and disposals as well as proceeds from divestitures and cash used for acquisitions 

the decrease  in cash used for investing activities in 2014  compared to 2013  was primarily due to a decrease in purchases of availableforsale investments and trading assetshigher maturities and sales of our availableforsale investments this activity was partially offset by an increase in investments in nonmarketable equity investments and lower maturities and sales of trading assets our capital expenditures were 101 billion  in 2014   107 billion  in 2013  and 110 billion  in 2012  

cash used for investing activities increased in 2013  compared to 2012  primarily due to an increase in purchases of availableforsale investments and a decrease in maturities and sales of trading assets partially offset by an increase in maturities and sales of availableforsale investments and a decrease in purchases of licensed technology and patents net purchases of availableforsale investments in 2012 included our purchase of 32 billion  of equity securities in asml in q3 2012 

financing activities 

financing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases of common stock payment of dividends to stockholders issuance and repayment of longterm debt and proceeds from the sale of common stock through employee equity incentive plans 

the increase  in cash used for financing activities in 2014  compared to 2013  was primarily due to an increase in repurchases of common stock under our authorized stock repurchase program partially offset by the issuance of shortterm debt in 2014 we have an ongoing authorization originally approved by our board of directors in 2005 and subsequently amended to repurchase up to   65 billion  in shares of our common stock in the open market or negotiated transactions this amount includes an increase of 20 billion  in the authorization limit approved by our board of directors in july 2014 during 2014  we repurchased 108 billion  of common stock under our authorized common stock repurchase program compared to 21 billion  in 2013  as of december 27 2014  124 billion  remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization limit we base our level of common stock repurchases on internal cash management decisions and this level may fluctuate proceeds from the sale of common stock through employee equity incentive plans totaled 17 billion  in 2014  compared to 16 billion  in 2013  our total dividend payments were 44 billion  in 2014  compared to 45 billion  in 2013  we have paid a cash dividend in each of the past 89  quarters in january 2015  our board of directors declared a cash dividend of 024  per share of common stock for q1 2015  the dividend is payable on march 1 2015  to stockholders of record on february 7 2015  

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

the increase in cash used for financing activities in 2013  compared to 2012  was primarily due to the issuance of longterm debt in 2012 and fewer repurchases of common stock under our authorized common stock repurchase program in 2013 

liquidity 

cash generated by operations is our primary source of liquidity we maintain a diverse investment portfolio that we continually analyze based on issuer industry and country as of december 27 2014  cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and trading assets totaled 141 billion   201 billion  as of december 28 2013  in addition to the 141 billion  we have 20 billion  of other longterm investments 13 billion  of loans receivable and other and 450 million  of reverse repurchase agreements with original maturities greater than approximately three months that we include when assessing our sources of liquidity most  of our investments in debt instruments are in aa2 or better  rated issuances and the majority  of the issuances are rated aaaa3 or better  

another potential source of liquidity is an ongoing authorization from our board of directors to borrow up to 30 billion  this ongoing authorization includes borrowings under our commercial paper program maximum borrowings under our commercial paper program were 24 billion  during 2014  and  500 million  of commercial paper remained outstanding as of december 27 2014  our commercial paper was rated a1  by standard  poor’s and p1  by moody’s as of december 27 2014  we also have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the sec pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt equity and other securities in 2012 we utilized this shelf registration statement and issued 62 billion  aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes the proceeds from the sale of these notes were used for general corporate purposes and to repurchase common stock pursuant to our authorized common stock repurchase program for further information on the terms of the notes see  note 15 borrowings  in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

as of december 27 2014  120 billion  of our cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and trading assets was held by our nonus subsidiaries of the 120 billion  held by our nonus subsidiaries approximately 23 billion  was available for use in the us without incurring additional us income taxes in excess of the amounts already accrued in our financial statements as of december 27 2014  the remaining amount of nonus cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and trading assets has been indefinitely reinvested and therefore no us current or deferred taxes have been accrued and this amount is earmarked for nearterm investment in our operations outside the us and future acquisitions of nonus entities we believe our us sources of cash and liquidity are sufficient to meet our business needs in the us and do not expect that we will need to repatriate the funds we have designated as indefinitely reinvested outside the us under current tax laws should our plans change and we were to choose to repatriate some or all of the funds we have designated as indefinitely reinvested outside the us such amounts would be subject to us income taxes and applicable nonus income and withholding taxes 

we believe we have sufficient financial resources to meet our business requirements in the next 12 months including capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test working capital requirements dividends common stock repurchases acquisitions and strategic investments

fair value of financial instruments 

when determining fair value we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and we consider assumptions such as an obligor’s credit risk that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability for further information see fair value in  note 2 accounting policies  and  note 4 fair value  in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

marketable debt instruments 

as of december 27 2014  our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included 150 billion  of marketable debt instruments of these instruments 69 billion  was classified as level 1 80 billion  as level 2 and 106 million  as level 3 

our marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 1 were classified as such due to the use of observable market prices for identical securities that are traded in active markets we evaluate securityspecific market data when determining whether the market for a debt security is active 

of the 80 billion  of marketable debt instruments measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 2 approximately 40  was classified as level 2 due to the use of a discounted cash flow model performed by us and approximately 60  was classified as such due to the use of nonbinding market consensus prices that were corroborated with observable market data 

our marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 3 are classified as such because the fair values are generally derived from discounted cash flow models performed either by us or our pricing providers using inputs that we are unable to corroborate with observable market data we monitor and review the inputs and results of these valuation models to help ensure the fair value measurements are reasonable and consistent with market experience in similar asset classes 

loans receivable and reverse repurchase agreements 

as of december 27 2014  our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included 721 million  of loans receivable and 268 million  of reverse repurchase agreements all of these investments were classified as level 2 as the fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data 

marketable equity securities 

as of december 27 2014  our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included 71 billion  of marketable equity securities all of these securities were classified as level 1 because the valuations were based on quoted prices for identical securities in active markets our assessment of an active market for our marketable equity securities generally takes into consideration the number of days that each individual equity security trades over a specified period 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

contractual obligations 

significant contractual obligations as of december 27 2014  were as follows 

 the expected timing of payments of the obligations in the preceding table is estimated based on current information timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations 

contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services included in other purchase obligations and commitments in the preceding table include agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on intel and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction for obligations with cancellation provisions the amounts included in the preceding table were limited to the noncancelable portion of the agreement terms or the minimum cancellation fee 

we have entered into certain agreements for the purchase of raw materials that specify minimum prices and quantities based on a percentage of the total available market or based on a percentage of our future purchasing requirements due to the uncertainty of the future market and our future purchasing requirements as well as the nonbinding nature of these agreements obligations under these agreements have been excluded from the preceding table our purchase orders for other products are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons in addition some of our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

contractual obligations that are contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones have been excluded from the preceding table these obligations include milestonebased comarketing agreements contingent funding or payment obligations and milestonebased equity investment funding these arrangements are not considered contractual obligations until the milestone is met by the third party as of december 27 2014  assuming that all future milestones are met excluding the asml milestones subsequently mentioned the additional required payments would be approximately 450 million  during 2012 we entered into a series of agreements with asml intended to accelerate the development of euv lithography certain of which were amended in 2014 under the amended agreements intel agreed to provide rd funding totaling   €829 million   over five years and committed to advance purchase orders for a specified number of tools from asml  our remaining obligation contingent upon asml achieving certain milestones is approximately €562 million  or 689 million  as of december 27 2014  as our obligation is contingent upon asml achieving certain milestones we have excluded this obligation from the preceding table 

for the majority of restricted stock units granted the number of shares of common stock issued on the date the restricted stock units vest is net of the minimum statutory withholding requirements that we pay in cash to the appropriate taxing authorities on behalf of our employees  the obligation to pay the relevant taxing authority is excluded from the preceding table as the amount is contingent upon continued employment in addition the amount of the obligation is unknown as it is based in part on the market price of our common stock when the awards vest 

during 2014 we entered into a series of agreements with tsinghua unigroup ltd tsinghua unigroup an operating subsidiary of tsinghua holdings co ltd to among other things jointly develop intel architecture and communicationsbased solutions for smartphones subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions we have also agreed to invest up to rmb 90 billion  approximately 15 billion  as of the date of the agreement for a minority stake of approximately 20  of the holding company under tsinghua unigroup which will own spreadtrum communications and rda microelectronics as our obligation is contingent upon regulatory approvals and other closing conditions it has been excluded from the preceding table 

offbalancesheet arrangements 

as of december 27 2014  we did not have any significant offbalancesheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk 




 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend we are affected by changes in currency exchange rates interest rates and equity prices all of the following potential changes are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial positions as of december 27 2014  and december 28 2013  actual results may differ materially 

currency exchange rates 

in general we economically hedge currency risks of nonusdollardenominated investments in debt instruments and loans receivable with currency forward contracts or currency interest rate swaps gains and losses on these nonuscurrency investments are generally offset by corresponding gains and losses on the related hedging instruments 

substantially all  of our revenue is transacted in us dollars however a significant amount  of our operating expenditures and capital purchases are incurred in or exposed to other currencies primarily the euro the japanese yen the chinese yuan and the israeli shekel  we have established balance sheet and forecasted transaction currency risk management programs to protect against fluctuations in the fair value and the volatility of the functional currency equivalent of future cash flows caused by changes in exchange rates we generally utilize currency forward contracts in these hedging programs these programs reduce but do not eliminate the impact of currency exchange movements  for further information see risk factors in part i item 1a of this form 10k we considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that a weighted average adverse change of 20  in currency exchange rates could be experienced in the near term such an adverse change after taking into account balance sheet hedges only and offsetting recorded monetary asset and liability positions would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before taxes of less than 50 million  as of december 27 2014  less than 40 million  as of december 28 2013  

interest rates 

we generally hedge interest rate risks of fixedrate debt instruments with interest rate swaps gains and losses on these investments are generally offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments 

we are exposed to interest rate risk related to our investment portfolio and indebtedness our indebtedness includes our debt issuances and the liability associated with a longterm patent crosslicense agreement with nvidia corporation the primary objective of our investments in debt instruments is to preserve principal while maximizing yields which generally track the us dollar threemonth libor a hypothetical decrease in interest rates of up to 10  would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our indebtedness of approximately 10 billion  as of december 27 2014  an increase of approximately 11 billion  as of december 28 2013  a hypothetical decrease in benchmark interest rates of up to 10  after taking into account investment hedges would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our investment portfolio of approximately 10 million  as of december 27 2014  an increase of approximately 10 million  as of december 28 2013  the fluctuations in fair value of our investment portfolio and indebtedness reflect only the direct impact of the change in interest rates other economic variables such as equity market fluctuations and changes in relative credit risk could result in a significantly higher decline in the fair value of our net investment position for further information on how credit risk is factored into the valuation of our investment portfolio and debt issuances see  note 4 fair value  in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

equity prices 

our investments include marketable equity securities and equity derivative instruments we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our equity market exposure through hedging activities at the inception of our investments before we enter into hedge arrangements we evaluate legal market and economic factors as well as the expected timing of disposal to determine whether hedging is appropriate our equity market risk management program may include equity derivatives with or without hedge accounting designation that utilize warrants equity options or other equity derivatives 

we also utilize total return swaps to offset changes in liabilities related to the equity market risks of certain deferred compensation arrangements gains and losses from changes in the fair value of these total return swaps are generally offset by the losses and gains on the related liabilities  

as of december 27 2014  the fair value of our marketable equity investments and our equity derivative instruments including hedging positions was 71 billion   63 billion  as of december 28 2013  substantially all  of our marketable equity investments portfolio as of december 27 2014  was concentrated in our investment in asml of 69 billion   59 billion  as of december 28 2013  our marketable equity method investments are excluded from our analysis as the carrying value does not fluctuate based on market price changes unless an otherthantemporary impairment is deemed necessary to determine reasonably possible decreases in the market value of our marketable equity investments we have analyzed the historical market price sensitivity of our marketable equity investment portfolio assuming a decline of 30  in market prices and after reflecting the impact of hedges and offsetting positions the aggregate value of our marketable equity investments could decrease by approximately 21 billion  based on the value as of december 27 2014  a decrease in value of approximately 16 billion  based on the value as of december 28 2013  using an assumed decline of 25  

many of the same factors that could result in an adverse movement of equity market prices affect our nonmarketable equity investments although we cannot always quantify the impact directly financial markets are volatile which could negatively affect the prospects of the companies we invest in their ability to raise additional capital and the likelihood of our ability to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings mergers and private sales these types of investments involve a great deal of risk and there can be no assurance that any specific company will grow or become successful consequently we could lose all or part of our investment our nonmarketable equity investments excluding investments accounted for under the equity method had a carrying amount of 18 billion  as of december 27 2014   13 billion  as of december 28 2013  the carrying amount of our nonmarketable equity method investments was 14 billion  as of december 27 2014   10 billion  as of december 28 2013  the majority of our nonmarketable equity method investments balance as of december 27 2014  was concentrated in our imft and cloudera which was purchased during 2014  investments of 713 million  and 280 million  respectively  646 million  for imft as of december 28 2013  

commodity price risk 

although we operate facilities that consume commodities we are not materially affected by commodity price risk we have established forecasted transaction risk management programs to protect against fluctuations in the fair value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in commodity prices in addition we have sourcing plans in place for our key commodities that mitigate the risk of a potential supplier concentration for further information on commodity price risk see  note 6 derivative financial instruments  in part ii item 8 of this form 10k

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act that occurred during the quarter ended december 27 2014  that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

management report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 

management assessed our internal control over financial reporting as of december 27 2014  the end of our fiscal year management based its assessment on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission  2013 framework  management’s assessment included evaluation of elements such as the design and operating effectiveness of key financial reporting controls process documentation accounting policies and our overall control environment 

based on this assessment management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the fiscal year to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles we reviewed the results of management’s assessment with the audit committee of our board of directors

inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

our management including the ceo and cfo does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures

competition 

the computing industry continuously evolves with new and enhanced technologies and products from existing and new providers the markets for current and planned technologies can change quickly in response to the introduction of such technologies and products and other factors such as changes in consumer tastes 

intel faces significant competition in the development and market acceptance of technologies and products in this environment our platforms based on intel architecture are positioned to compete across the spectrum of internetconnected computing devices from the lowestpower portable devices to the most powerful data center servers 

we are a leading provider in the pc and server segments where we face existing and emerging competition in the pc segment smaller mobile devices such as tablets and smartphones offered by numerous vendors have become significant competitors to pcs for many usages most of these small devices currently use applications processors based on the arm architecture feature lowpower long batterylife operation and are built in soc formats which integrate numerous functions on one chip in the server segment our data center products and platforms face emerging competition from many new entrants using arm architecture or other technologies 

we are a relatively new entrant to the segments for tablets smartphones and similar mobile devices we have adjusted our product roadmaps to emphasize the development of lowpower soc chips for these and other devices the boundaries between the various segments are changing as the industry evolves and new segments emerge 

we have a longstanding position as a supplier of components and software for embedded products and this marketplace is significantly expanding with increasing types and numbers of internetconnected devices for industrial commercial and consumer uses which we refer to as the internet of things we face numerous large and small incumbent competitors as well as new entrants in this growing market segment that use arm architecture as well as other operating systems and software 

our products primarily compete based on performance energy efficiency integration innovative design features price quality reliability brand recognition and availability the importance of these items will vary by the type of end system for the products for example performance might be among the most important factors for our products for servers while price and integration might be among the most important factors for our products for tablets and smartphones 

we are the owner of mcafee a major provider of digital security products and services to businesses and consumers there are numerous competitors offering security products and services and we seek to offer competitive differentiation by integrating hardware and software security features in many of our offerings and to have security offerings in numerous market segments including mobile and embedded devices and for data centers 

the ability of our products to operate on multiple operating systems in enduser products and platforms operated or sold by third parties including oems is a key competitive advantage we seek to optimize our products for multiple operating systems and invest substantial resources working with third parties to do so but such investments are risky given that it is not clear which products will succeed in the market 

we have competitors in each of the market segments including other companies that make and sell microprocessors socs other silicon components software and platforms to businesses which build and sell computing and communications devices to endusers we also compete against others selling these goods and services to businesses that utilize the products for their internal processes eg businesses running large data centers we also face competition from oems that to some degree choose to vertically integrate their own proprietary semiconductor and software assets by doing so these oems may be attempting to offer greater differentiation in their products and to increase their share of the profits for each finished product they sell 

continuing changes in the industry such as acquisitions business collaborations or licensing scenarios such as injunctions or other litigation outcomes could have a significant impact on our competitive position 

one of our important competitive advantages is the combination of our network of manufacturing assembly and test facilities with our global architecture design teams we have made significant capital and research and development rd investments into t his integrated manufacturing network which enables us to have more direct control over our processes quality control product cost production timing performance power consumption and manufacturing yield the increased cost of constructing new fabrication facilities supporting smaller transistor geometries and larger wafers has led to a smaller pool of companies that can afford to build and equip leadingedge manufacturing facilities most of our competitors rely on thirdparty foundries and subcontractors such as taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company ltd and globalfoundries inc for manufacturing and assembly and test needs we have recently start ed providing foundry services as an alternative to such foundries 

manufacturing and assembly and test 

as of december 28 2013  46  of our wafer fabrication including microprocessors and chipsets was conducted within the us at our facilities in new mexico arizona oregon and massachusetts the remaining 54  of our wafer fabrication was conducted outside the us at our facilities in israel and china our fabrication facility in ireland is currently transitioning to a newer process technology node with manufacturing expected to recommence in 2015 wafer fabrication conducted within and outside the us may be impacted by the timing of a facility’s transition to a newer process technology as well as a facility’s capacity utilization 

as of december 28 2013  we primarily manufactured our products in wafer fabrication facilities at the following locations 

as of december 28 2013  most of our microprocessors were manufactured on 300mm wafers using our 22nm and 32nm process technology our massachusetts fabrication facility is our last manufacturing on 200mm wafers and is expected to cease production by the end of 2014 as we move to each succeeding generation of manufacturing process technology we incur significant startup costs to prepare each factory for manufacturing however continuing to advance our process technology provides benefits that we believe justify these costs the benefits of moving to each succeeding generation of manufacturing process technology can include using less space per transistor reducing heat output from each transistor and increasing the number of integrated features on each chip these advancements can result in microprocessors that are higher performing consume less power and cost less to manufacture in addition with each shift to a new process technology we are able to produce more microprocessors per square foot of our wafer fabrication facilities the costs to develop our process technology are significantly less than adding capacity by building additional wafer fabrication facilities using older process technology 

we use thirdparty foundries to manufacture wafers for certain components including networking and communications products in addition we primarily use subcontractors to manufacture boardlevel products and systems we purchase certain communications networking products and mobile phone components from external vendors primarily in the asiapacific region 

following the manufacturing process the majority of our components are subject to assembly and test we perform our components assembly and test at facilities in malaysia china costa rica and vietnam  to augment capacity we use subcontractors to perform assembly of certain products primarily chipsets and networking and communications products in addition we use subcontractors to perform assembly and test of our mobile phone components 

our nand flash memory products are manufactured by imft and micron using 20nm 25nm or 34nm process technology and assembly and test of these products is performed by micron and other external subcontractors for further information see “ note 5 cash and investments ” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

our employment practices are consistent with and we expect our suppliers and subcontractors to abide by local country law in addition we impose a minimum employee age requirement as well as progressive environmental health and safety ehs requirements regardless of local law 

we have thousands of suppliers including subcontractors providing our various materials and service needs we set expectations for supplier performance and reinforce those expectations with periodic assessments we communicate those expectations to our suppliers regularly and work with them to implement improvements when necessary where possible we seek to have several sources of supply for all of these materials and resources but we may rely on a single or limited number of suppliers or upon suppliers in a single country in those cases we develop and implement plans and actions to reduce the exposure that would result from a disruption in supply we have entered into longterm contracts with certain suppliers to ensure a portion of our silicon supply 

our products are typically manufactured at multiple intel facilities around the world or by subcontractors however some products are manufactured in only one intel or subcontractor facility and we seek to implement action plans to reduce the exposure that would result from a disruption at any such facility see “risk factors” in part i item 1a of this form 10k 

research and development 

we are committed to investing in worldclass technology development particularly in the design and manufacture of integrated circuits rd expenditures were 106 billion  in 2013   101 billion  in 2012  and 84 billion  in 2011

as part of our rd efforts we plan to introduce a new intel core microarchitecture for desktops notebooks including ultrabook devices and 2 in 1 systems and intel xeon processors approximately every two years and ramp the next generation of silicon process technology in the intervening years we refer to this as our “ticktock” technology development cadence as subsequently illustrated 

advances in our silicon technology have enabled us to continue making moore’s law a reality we expect to begin manufacturing products using our 14nm process technology in q1 2014 we are currently developing our 5th generation intel core processor family codenamed “broadwell” using our 14nm process technology expected to be released in the second half of 2014 we are also developing 10nm manufacturing process technology our nextgeneration process technology 

we have continued expanding on the advances anticipated by moore’s law by bringing new capabilities into silicon and producing new products optimized for a wider variety of applications we have accelerated the intel atom processorbased soc roadmap for ultramobile form factors including smartphones and tablets as well as notebooks including ultrabook devices and 2 in 1 systems embedded systems and microserver applications from 32nm through 22nm to 14nm we intend that intel atom processors for ultramobile form factors will eventually be on the same process technology as our leadingedge products we expect that this acceleration will result in a significant reduction in transistor leakage lower active power and an increase in transistor density to enable more powerful featurerich smartphones and tablets with longer battery life intel   quark soc our newest technology announced in q3 2013 is an ultralow power and lowcost architecture designed for the internet of things from industrial machines to wearable devices 

with our continued focus on silicon and manufacturing technology leadership we entered into a series of agreements with asml holding nv asml in 2012 these agreements in which intel purchased asml securities and agreed to provide rd funding over five years are intended to accelerate the development of 450mm wafer technology and euv lithography 

our rd activities range from designing and developing new products and manufacturing processes to researching future technologies and products we continue to make significant rd investments in the development of socs to enable growth in ultramobile form factors in addition we continue to make significant investments in wireless technologies including our work to develop a highspeed lte solution for smartphones our second generation volte product with lteadvanced features such as carrier aggregation is expected to be available in the first half of 2014 we also continue to invest in graphics and hpc 

our rd model is based on a global organization that emphasizes a collaborative approach to identifying and developing new technologies leading standards initiatives and influencing regulatory policies to accelerate the adoption of new technologies including joint pathfinding conducted between researchers at intel labs and our business groups we centrally manage key crossbusiness group product initiatives to align and prioritize our rd activities across these groups in addition we may augment our rd activities by investing in companies or entering into agreements with companies that have similar rd focus areas as well as directly purchasing or licensing technology applicable to our rd initiatives 

employees 

as of december 28 2013  we had 107600  employees worldwide  105000  as of december 29 2012  with approximately 51  of those employees located in the us  51  as of december 29 2012  

sales and marketing 

customers 

we sell our products primarily to oems and odms odms provide design and manufacturing services to branded and unbranded privatelabel resellers in addition we sell our products to other manufacturers including makers of a wide range of industrial and communications equipment our customers also include those who buy pc components and our other products through distributor reseller retail and oem channels throughout the world 

our worldwide reseller sales channel consists of thousands of indirect customers—systems builders that purchase intel microprocessors and other products from our distributors we have a boxed processor program that allows distributors to sell our microprocessors in small quantities to customers of systems builders boxed processors are also available in direct retail outlets 

in 2013  hewlettpackard company accounted for 17  of our net revenue  18  in 2012  and 19  in 2011  dell inc accounted for 15  of our net revenue  14  in 2012  and 15  in 2011  and lenovo group limited accounted for 12  of our net revenue  11  in 2012  and 9  in 2011  no other customer accounted for more than 10 of our net revenue during such periods for information about net revenue and operating income by operating segment and net revenue from unaffiliated customers by country see “ note 27 operating segments and geographic information ” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

sales arrangements 

our products are sold through sales offices throughout the world sales of our products are typically made via purchase order acknowledgments that contain standard terms and conditions covering matters such as pricing payment terms and warranties as well as indemnities for issues specific to our products such as patent and copyright indemnities from time to time we may enter into additional agreements with customers covering for example changes from our standard terms and conditions new product development and marketing privatelabel branding and other matters most of our sales are made using electronic and webbased processes that allow the customer to review inventory availability and track the progress of specific goods ordered pricing on particular products may vary based on volumes ordered and other factors we also offer discounts rebates and other incentives to customers to increase acceptance of our products and technology 

our products are typically shipped under terms that transfer title to the customer even in arrangements for which the recognition of revenue and related cost of sales is deferred our standard terms and conditions of sale typically provide that payment is due at a later date generally 30 days after shipment or delivery our credit department sets accounts receivable and shipping limits for individual customers to control credit risk to intel arising from outstanding account balances we assess credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis and from this analysis we establish credit limits and determine whether we will use one or more credit support devices such as a parent guarantee or standby letter of credit or credit insurance credit losses may still be incurred due to bankruptcy fraud or other failure of the customer to pay for information about our allowance for doubtful receivables see “schedule ii—valuation and qualifying accounts” in part iv of this form 10k 

most of our sales to distributors are made under agreements allowing for price protection on unsold merchandise and a right of return on stipulated quantities of unsold merchandise under the price protection program we give distributors credits for the difference between the original price paid and the current price that we offer on most products there is no contractual limit on the amount of price protection nor is there a limit on the time horizon under which price protection is granted the right of return granted generally consists of a stock rotation program in which distributors are able to exchange certain products based on the number of qualified purchases made by the distributor we have the option to grant credit for repair or replace defective products and there is no contractual limit on the amount of credit that may be granted to a distributor for defective products 

distribution 

distributors typically handle a wide variety of products including those that compete with our products and fill orders for many customers we also utilize thirdparty sales representatives who generally do not offer directly competitive products but may carry complementary items manufactured by others sales representatives do not maintain a product inventory instead their customers place orders directly with us or through distributors we have several distribution warehouses that are located in proximity to key customers 

backlog 

over time our larger customers have generally moved to leaninventory or justintime operations rather than maintaining larger inventories of our products as our customers continue to lower their inventories our processes to fulfill their orders have evolved to meet their needs as a result our manufacturing production is based on estimates and advance nonbinding commitments from customers as to future purchases our order backlog as of any particular date is a mix of these commitments and specific firm orders that are primarily made pursuant to standard purchase orders for delivery of products only a small portion of our orders is noncancelable and the dollar amount associated with the noncancelable portion is not significant 

seasonal trends 

historically our platform sales have generally been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year accelerating in the third quarter and peaking in the fourth quarter 

marketing 

our corporate marketing objectives are to build a strong wellknown intel corporate brand that connects with businesses and consumers and to offer a limited number of meaningful and valuable brands in our portfolio to aid businesses and consumers in making informed choices about technology purchases the intel core processor family and the intel atom intel ®  pentium ®  intel xeon intel xeon phi and intel ®  itanium ®  trademarks make up our processor brands 

we promote brand awareness and generate demand through our own direct marketing as well as through comarketing programs our direct marketing activities include television print and internet advertising as well as press relations and social media consumer and trade events and industry and consumer communications we market to consumer and business audiences and focus on building awareness and generating demand for new form factors such as ultrabook and 2 in 1 systems and for increased performance improved energy efficiency and other capabilities such as internet connectivity and security 

purchases by customers often allow them to participate in cooperative advertising and marketing programs such as the intel inside ®  program this program broadens the reach of our brands beyond the scope of our own direct marketing through the intel inside program certain customers are licensed to place intel logos on computing devices containing our microprocessors and processor technologies and to use our brands in their marketing activities the program includes a market development component that accrues funds based on purchases and partially reimburses the oems for marketing activities for products featuring intel brands subject to the oems meeting defined criteria these marketing activities primarily include television print and internet marketing we have also entered into joint marketing arrangements with certain customers 

intellectual property rights and licensing 

intel owns significant intellectual property ip around the world that relates to our products services research and development and other activities and assets our ip portfolio includes patents copyrights trade secrets trademarks trade dress rights and maskwork rights we actively seek to protect our global ip rights and to deter unauthorized use of our ip and other assets such efforts can be difficult however particularly in countries that provide less protection to ip rights and in the absence of harmonized international ip standards see “risk factors” in part i item 1a and “ note 26 contingencies ” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

we have obtained patents in the us and other countries while our patents are an important element of our success our business as a whole is not significantly dependent on any one patent because of the fast pace of innovation and product development and the comparative pace of governments’ patenting processes our products are often obsolete before the patents related to them expire in some cases our products may be obsolete before the patents related to them are granted as we expand our products into new industries we also seek to extend our patent development efforts to patent such products in addition to developing patents based on our own research and development efforts we purchase patents from third parties to supplement our patent portfolio established competitors in existing and new industries as well as companies that purchase and enforce patents and other ip may already have patents covering similar products there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain patents covering our own products or that we will be able to obtain licenses from other companies on favorable terms or at all 

the software that we distribute including software embedded in our componentlevel and platform products is entitled to copyright and other ip protection to distinguish our products from our competitors’ products we have obtained trademarks and trade names for our products and we maintain cooperative advertising programs with customers to promote our brands and to identify products containing genuine intel components we also protect details about our processes products and strategies as trade secrets keeping confidential the information that we believe provides us with a competitive advantage 

compliance with environmental health and safety regulations 

our compliance efforts focus on monitoring regulatory and resource trends and setting companywide performance targets for key resources and emissions these targets address several parameters including product design chemical energy and water use waste recycling the source of certain minerals used in our products climate change and emissions 

as a company we focus on reducing natural resource use the solid and chemical waste byproducts of our manufacturing processes and the environmental impact of our products we currently use a variety of materials in our manufacturing process that have the potential to adversely impact the environment and are subject to a variety of ehs laws and regulations over the past several years we have significantly reduced the use of lead and halogenated flame retardants in our products and manufacturing processes 

we work with the us environmental protection agency epa nongovernmental organizations ngos oems and retailers to help manage ewaste including electronic products nearing the end of their useful lives and to promote recycling the european union requires producers of certain electrical and electronic equipment to develop programs that let consumers return products for recycling many states in the us have similar ewaste takeback laws although these laws are typically targeted at the end electronic product and not the component products that we manufacture the inconsistency of many ewaste takeback laws and the lack of local ewaste management options in many areas pose a challenge for our compliance efforts 

we are an industry leader in our efforts to build ethical sourcing of minerals for our products including “conflict minerals” from the democratic republic of the congo drc and adjoining countries in 2013 we accomplished our goal to manufacture microprocessors that are drc conflict free for tantalum tin tungsten and gold in 2014 we will continue our work to establish drc conflict free supply chains for these minerals for our company and our industry 

we seek to reduce our global greenhouse gas emissions by investing in energy conservation projects in our factories and working with suppliers to improve energy efficiency we take a holistic approach to power management addressing the challenge at the silicon package circuit microarchitecture macro architecture platform and software levels we recognize that climate change may cause general economic risk for further information on the risks of climate change see “risk factors” in part i item 1a of this form 10k we see a potential for higher energy costs driven by climate change regulations this could include items applied to utility companies that are passed along to customers such as carbon taxes or costs associated with obtaining permits for our manufacturing operations emission cap and trade programs or renewable portfolio standards 

we are committed to sustainability and take a leadership position in promoting voluntary environmental initiatives and working proactively with governments environmental groups and industry to promote global environmental sustainability we believe that technology will be fundamental to finding solutions to the world’s environmental challenges and we are joining forces with industry business and governments to find and promote ways that technology can be used as a tool to combat climate change 

we have been purchasing wind power and other forms of renewable energy at some of our major sites for several years we purchase renewable energy certificates under a multiyear contract this purchase has placed intel at the top of the epa’s green power partnership for the past four years and is intended to help stimulate the market for green power leading to additional generating capacity and ultimately lower costs

risk factors 

tableend changes in product demand may harm our financial results and are hard to predict 

if product demand decreases our revenue and profit could be harmed important factors that could cause demand for our products to decrease include changes in 

 our operations have high costs—including costs related to facility construction and equipment rd and employment and training of a highly skilled workforce—that are either fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term at the same time demand for our products is highly variable and in recent years we have experienced declining orders in the traditional pc market segment which has been negatively impacted by the growth in ultramobile devices such as tablets and smartphones  if product demand decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately we could be required to write off inventory or record excess capacity charges which would lower our gross margin our manufacturing or assembly and test capacity could be underutilized and we may be required to write down our longlived assets which would increase our expenses factoryplanning decisions may shorten the useful lives of facilities and equipment and cause us to accelerate depreciation if product demand increases we may be unable to add capacity fast enough to meet market demand our revenue and gross margin percentage can also be affected by the timing of our product introductions and related expenses including marketing expenses changes in product demand and changes in our customers’ product needs could negatively affect our competitive position and may reduce our revenue increase our costs lower our gross margin percentage or require us to write down our assets 

we operate in highly competitive industries and our failure to anticipate and respond to technological and market developments could harm our ability to compete 

we operate in highly competitive industries that experience rapid technological and market developments changes in industry standards changes in customer needs and frequent product introductions and improvements if we are unable to anticipate and respond to these developments we might weaken our competitive position and our products or technologies might be uncompetitive or obsolete as computing market segments emerge such as smartphones tablets and consumer electronics devices we face new sources of competition and customers with needs different from those of customers in the pc market segment some of our competitors are pursuing a vertical integration strategy incorporating their soc solutions into the smartphones and tablets they offer which could make it less likely that they will adopt our soc solutions to be successful we need to cultivate new industry relationships in these market segments as the number and variety of internetconnected devices increase we need to continuously improve the cost connectivity integration features energy efficiency and security of our platforms among other things to succeed in these market segments in addition we need to expand our software capabilities to provide customers with comprehensive computing solutions 

to compete successfully we must maintain a successful rd effort develop new products and production processes and improve our existing products and processes ahead of competitors for example we invest substantially in our network of manufacturing assembly and test facilities including the construction of new fabrication facilities to support smaller transistor geometries and larger wafers our rd efforts are critical to our success and are aimed at solving complex problems and we do not expect all of our projects to be successful we may be unable to develop and market new products successfully and the products we invest in and develop may not be well received by customers our rd investments may not generate significant operating income or contribute to our future operating results for several years and such contributions may not meet our expectations or even cover the costs of such investments additionally the products and technologies offered by others may affect demand for or pricing of our products these types of events could negatively affect our competitive position and may reduce revenue increase costs lower gross margin percentage or require us to impair our assets 

changes in the mix of products sold may harm our financial results 

because of the wide price differences of platform average selling prices among our data center pc client and other ia platforms a change in the mix of platforms among these market segments may impact our revenue and gross margin for example our pc client platforms that are incorporated in notebook and desktop computers tend to have lower average selling prices and gross margin than our data center platforms that are incorporated in servers workstations and storage products therefore if there is less demand for our data center platforms and a resulting mix shift to our pc client platforms our gross margins and revenue would decrease also more recently introduced products tend to have higher costs because of initial development costs and lower production volumes relative to the previous product generation which can impact gross margin 

our global operations subject us to risks that may harm our results of operations and financial condition 

we have sales offices rd manufacturing assembly and test facilities and other facilities in many countries and some business activities may be concentrated in one or more geographic areas as a result our ability to manufacture assemble and test design develop or sell products may be affected by 

 legal and regulatory requirements differ among jurisdictions worldwide violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation although we have policies controls and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws our employees contractors or agents may violate our policies 

although most of our sales occur in us dollars expenses such as payroll utilities tax and marketing expenses may be paid in local currencies we also conduct certain investing and financing activities in local currencies our hedging programs reduce but do not eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements therefore changes in exchange rates could harm our results of operations and financial condition changes in tariff and import regulations and in us and nonus monetary policies may harm our results of operations and financial condition by increasing our expenses and reducing revenue differing tax rates in various jurisdictions could harm our results of operations and financial condition by increasing our overall tax rate 

we maintain a program of insurance coverage for a variety of property casualty and other risks we place our insurance coverage with multiple carriers in numerous jurisdictions however one or more of our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim the types and amounts of insurance we obtain vary depending on availability cost and decisions with respect to risk retention the policies have deductibles and exclusions that result in us retaining a level of selfinsurance losses not covered by insurance may be large which could harm our results of operations and financial condition 

failure to meet our production targets resulting in undersupply or oversupply of products may harm our business and results of operations 

production of integrated circuits is a complex process disruptions in this process can result from errors difficulties in our development and implementation of new processes defects in materials disruptions in our supply of materials or resources and disruptions at our fabrication and assembly and test facilities due to accidents maintenance issues or unsafe working conditions—all of which could affect the timing of production ramps and yields we may not be successful or efficient in developing or implementing new production processes production issues may result in our failure to meet or increase production as desired resulting in higher costs or large decreases in yields which could affect our ability to produce sufficient volume to meet product demand the unavailability or reduced availability of products could make it more difficult to deliver computing platforms the occurrence of these events could harm our business and results of operations 

we may have difficulties obtaining the resources or products we need for manufacturing assembling and testing our products or operating other aspects of our business which could harm our ability to meet demand and increase our costs 

we have thousands of suppliers providing materials that we use in production and other aspects of our business and where possible we seek to have several sources of supply for all of those materials however we may rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers or upon suppliers in a single location for these materials the inability of suppliers to deliver adequate supplies of production materials or other supplies could disrupt our production processes or make it more difficult for us to implement our business strategy production could be disrupted by the unavailability of resources used in production such as water silicon electricity gases and other materials future environmental regulations could restrict the supply or increase the cost of materials that we use in our business and make it more difficult to obtain permits to build or modify manufacturing capacity to meet demand the unavailability or reduced availability of materials or resources may require us to reduce production or incur additional costs the occurrence of these events could harm our business and results of operations 

costs related to product defects and errata may harm our results of operations and business 

costs of product defects and errata deviations from published specifications due to for example problems in our design and manufacturing processes could include 

 these costs could be large and may increase expenses and lower gross margin our reputation with customers or end users could be damaged as a result of product defects and errata and product demand could be reduced the announcement of product defects and errata could cause customers to purchase products from competitors as a result of possible shortages of intel components or for other reasons these factors could harm our business and financial results 

third parties might attempt to gain unauthorized access to our network or seek to compromise our products and services which could damage our reputation and financial results 

we regularly face attempts by others to gain unauthorized access through the internet or to introduce malicious software to our it systems additionally malicious hackers may attempt to gain unauthorized access and corrupt the processes of hardware and software products that we manufacture and services we provide these attempts might be the result of industrial or other espionage or actions by hackers seeking to harm our company our products and services or users of our products and services due to the widespread use of our products and due to the high profile of our mcafee subsidiary we or our products and services are a frequent target of computer hackers and organizations that intend to sabotage take control of or otherwise corrupt our manufacturing or other processes products and services we are also a target of malicious attackers who attempt to gain access to our network or data centers or those of our customers or end users steal proprietary information related to our business products employees and customers or interrupt our systems and services or those of our customers or others we believe such attempts are increasing in number and in technical sophistication these attacks are sometimes successful and in some instances we our customers and the users of our products and services might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects we seek to detect and investigate such attempts and incidents and to prevent their recurrence where practicable through changes to our internal processes and tools andor changes or patches to our products and services but in some cases preventive and remedial action might not be successful such attacks whether successful or unsuccessful could result in our incurring costs related to for example rebuilding internal systems reduced inventory value providing modifications to our products and services defending against litigation responding to regulatory inquiries or actions paying damages or taking other remedial steps with respect to third parties publicity about vulnerabilities and attempted or successful incursions could damage our reputation with customers or users and reduce demand for our products and services 

we may be subject to theft loss or misuse of personal data about us or our employees customers or other third parties which could increase our expenses damage our reputation or result in litigation 

global privacy legislation enforcement and policy activity are rapidly expanding and creating a complex compliance environment the theft loss or misuse of personal data collected used stored or transferred by us to run our business could result in increased security costs or costs related to defending legal claims costs to comply with and implement privacyrelated and data protection measures could be significant our failure to comply with federal state or international privacyrelated or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others 

third parties may claim infringement of ip rights which could harm our business 

we may face ip rights infringement claims from individuals and companies including those who have acquired patent portfolios to assert claims against other companies we are engaged in a number of litigation matters involving ip rights claims that our products or processes infringe the ip rights of others could cause us to incur large costs to respond to defend and resolve the claims and they may divert the efforts and attention of management and technical personnel as a result of ip rights infringement claims we could 

 these actions could harm our competitive position result in expenses or require us to impair our assets if we alter or stop production of affected items our revenue could be harmed 

we may be unable to enforce or protect our ip rights which may harm our ability to compete and may harm our business 

our ability to enforce our patents copyrights software licenses and other ip rights is subject to general litigation risks as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our ip rights in various countries when we seek to enforce our rights we are often subject to claims that the ip rights are invalid not enforceable or licensed to the opposing party our assertion of ip rights often results in the other party seeking to assert claims against us which could harm our business governments may adopt regulations—and governments or courts may render decisions—requiring compulsory licensing of ip rights or governments may require products to meet standards that serve to favor local companies our inability to enforce our ip rights under these circumstances may harm our competitive position and business 

we may be subject to ip theft or misuse which could result in claims against us and harm our business and results of operations 

the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products the value of our investment in rd product development and marketing could be reduced in addition the theft or unauthorized use or publication of third party trade secrets and other confidential business information that we obtain in conducting our business might lead to thirdparty claims against us related to the loss of the confidential or proprietary information or enduser data any such incidents and claims could severely disrupt our business and we could suffer losses including the cost of product recalls and returns and reputational harm 

our licenses with other companies and participation in industry initiatives may allow competitors to use our patent rights 

companies in the computing industry often bilaterally license patents between each other to settle disputes or as part of business agreements between them our competitors may have licenses to our patents and under current case law some of the licenses may permit these competitors to pass our patent rights on to others under some circumstances our participation in industry standards organizations or with other industry initiatives may require us to license our patents to companies that adopt industrystandard specifications depending on the rules of the organization we might have to grant these licenses to our patents for little or no cost and as a result we may be unable to enforce certain patents against others our costs of enforcing our licenses or protecting our patents may increase and the value of our ip rights may be impaired in addition we may not be able to obtain licenses on fair reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms to patents asserted to be essential to standards that we implement in our products 

litigation or regulatory proceedings could harm our business 

we may face legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder consumer competition and other issues on a global basis as described in “ note 26 contingencies ” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k we are engaged in a number of litigation and regulatory matters litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain and adverse rulings could occur including monetary damages or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling products engaging in business practices or requiring other remedies such as compulsory licensing of patents 

we face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties 

we sell a portion of our products through third parties such as distributors valueadded resellers oems internet service providers and channel partners collectively referred to as distributors using third parties for distribution exposes us to many risks including competitive pressure concentration credit risk and compliance risks distributors may sell products that compete with our products and we may need to provide financial and other incentives to focus distributors on the sale of our products we may rely on one or more key distributors for a product and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue distributors may face financial difficulties including bankruptcy which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and financial results violations of fcpa or similar laws by distributors or other thirdparty intermediaries could have a material impact on our business failing to manage risks related to our use of distributors may reduce sales increase expenses and weaken our competitive position 

we face risks related to sales to government entities 

we derive a portion of our revenue from sales to government entities and their respective agencies government demand and payment for our products may be affected by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations government contracts are subject to oversight including special rules on accounting expenses reviews and security failing to comply with these rules could result in civil and criminal penalties and sanctions including termination of contracts fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business 

we invest in companies for strategic reasons and may not realize a return on our investments 

we make investments in companies around the world to further our strategic objectives and support key business initiatives these investments include equity or debt instruments of public or private companies and many of these instruments are nonmarketable at the time of our initial investment companies range from earlystage companies that are still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models the companies in which we invest may fail because they are unable to secure additional funding obtain favorable terms for future financings or participate in liquidity events such as public offerings mergers and private sales if any of these companies fail we could lose all or part of our investment if we determine that an otherthantemporary decline in the fair value exists for an investment we write down the investment to its fair value and recognize a loss impacting gains losses on equity investments net 

our results of operations could vary as a result of the methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying accounting policies 

the methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying accounting policies have a large impact on our results of operations for more information see “critical accounting estimates” in part ii item 7 of this form 10k these methods estimates and judgments are subject to large risks uncertainties and assumptions and changes could affect our results of operations 

changes in our effective tax rate may harm our results of operations 

a number of factors may increase our effective tax rates which could reduce our net income including 

 21 

decisions about the scope of operations of our business could affect our results of operations and financial condition 

changes in the business environment could lead to changes in the scope of our operations resulting in restructuring and asset impairment charges in addition to those announced in the last twelve months factors that could affect our results of operations and financial condition due to a change in the scope of our operations include 

 our acquisitions divestitures and other transactions could disrupt our ongoing business and harm our results of operations 

in pursuing our business strategy we routinely conduct discussions evaluate opportunities and enter into agreements for possible investments acquisitions divestitures and other transactions such as joint ventures acquisitions and other transactions involve large challenges and risks including risks that 

 when we decide to sell assets or a business we may have difficulty selling on acceptable terms in a timely manner and the agreedupon terms and financing arrangements could be renegotiated due to changes in business or market conditions these circumstances could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives or cause us to incur added expense or we may sell a business at a price or on terms that are less favorable than we had anticipated resulting in a loss on the transaction 

if we do enter into agreements with respect to acquisitions divestitures or other transactions we may fail to complete them due to factors such as 

 our failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could harm our business and results of operations 

the manufacturing and assembly and test of our products require the use of hazardous materials that are subject to a broad array of ehs laws and regulations our failure to comply with these laws or regulations could result in 

 our failure to manage the use transportation emissions discharge storage recycling or disposal of hazardous materials could lead to increased costs or future liabilities environmental laws and regulations could also require us to acquire pollution abatement or remediation equipment modify product designs or incur other expenses many new materials that we are evaluating for use in our operations may be subject to regulation under environmental laws and regulations these restrictions could harm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter manufacturing and assembly and test processes 

in addition the sec has adopted disclosure rules for companies that use conflict minerals commonly referred to as tantalum tin tungsten and gold in their products with substantial supply chain verification requirements in the event that the materials come from the drc or adjoining countries the european union and other foreign jurisdictions may in the future also enact rules regarding conflict minerals which could potentially cover additional minerals or locations where minerals originate due to the complexity of our supply chain we may face reputational challenges with our customers stockholders and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of the conflict minerals used in our products 

climate change poses both regulatory and physical risks that could harm our results of operations and affect the way we conduct business 

in addition to the possible direct economic impact that climate change could have on us climate change mitigation programs and regulations can increase our costs the cost of perfluorocompounds pfcs—a gas that we use in manufacturing—could increase under some climatechangefocused emissions trading programs that may be imposed through regulation if the use of pfcs is prohibited we would need to obtain substitute materials that may cost more or be less available for our manufacturing operations airquality permit requirements for our manufacturing operations could become more burdensome and cause delays in our ability to modify or build additional manufacturing capacity under recently adopted greenhouse gas regulations in the us many of our manufacturing facilities have become “major” sources under the clean air act at a minimum this change in status results in some uncertainty as the epa adopts guidance on its greenhouse gas regulations due to the dynamic nature of our operations these regulations will likely result in increased costs for our us operations these cost increases could be associated with new air pollution control requirements and increased or new monitoring recordkeeping and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions we also see the potential for higher energy costs driven by climate change regulations our costs could increase if utility companies pass on their costs such as those associated with carbon taxes emission cap and trade programs or renewable portfolio standards while we maintain business recovery plans that are intended to allow us to recover from natural disasters or other events that can be disruptive to our business we cannot be sure that our plans will fully protect us from all such disasters or events many of our operations are located in semiarid regions such as israel and the southwestern us some scenarios predict that these regions may become even more vulnerable to prolonged droughts due to climate change 

in order to compete we must attract retain and motivate key employees and our failure to do so could harm our results of operations 

in order to compete we must attract retain and motivate executives and other key employees hiring and retaining qualified executives scientists engineers technical staff and sales representatives are critical to our business and competition for experienced employees in the semiconductor industry can be intense to help attract retain and motivate qualified employees we use sharebased incentive awards such as employee stock options and nonvested share units restricted stock units if the value of such stock awards does not appreciate as measured by the performance of the price of our common stock or if our sharebased compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit our ability to attract retain and motivate employees could be weakened which could harm our results of operations 

a number of factors could lower interest and other net harming our results of operations 

factors that could lower interest and other net in our consolidated statements of income include changes in fixedincome equity and credit markets foreign currency exchange rates interest rates credit standing of financial instrument counterparties our cash and investment balances and our indebtedness 

there are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of our controls   

we do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures

overview 

our results of operations for each period were as follows 



revenue for 2013 was down 1 from 2012 pccg experienced lower platform unit sales in the first half of the year but saw offsetting growth in the back half as the pc market began to show signs of stabilization dcg continued to benefit from the build out of internet cloud computing and the strength of our product portfolio resulting in increased platform volumes for dcg for the year higher factory startup costs for our nextgeneration 14nm process technology led to a decrease in gross margin compared to 2012 in response to the current business environment and to better align resources management approved several restructuring actions including targeted workforce reductions as well as the exit of certain businesses and facilities these actions resulted in restructuring and asset impairment charges of 240 million for 2013  

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

our q4 2013 revenue of 138 billion was up 3 from q3 2013 the sequential increase was a result of stabilization in the pc market which generated 3 higher platform unit sales for pccg gross margin remained flat sequentially as lower platform unit costs were offset by higher factory startup costs for our 14nm process technology the platform unit cost decline is attributable to our 22nm process technology coming down the cost curve as we ramp the 4th generation intel core processor family products in multiple fabrication facilities 

in 2013 we introduced many new product technologies across all of our businesses our product launches included the 4th generation intel core processor family intel xeon 22nm processors and intel atom microarchitecture platforms as 2013 progressed we shifted our focus and investment strategy in order to increase our cadence for bringing innovative products to market one example is the announcement of intel quark soc which is an ultralow power and cost architecture designed for the internet of things from industrial machines to future wearable devices    

the cash generation from our business remained strong with cash from operations of 208 billion in 2013 we ended the year with an investment portfolio of 201 billion which consisted of cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and trading assets we returned 45 billion to stockholders through dividends and repurchased 21 billion of common stock through our common stock repurchase program we purchased 107 billion in capital assets as we continued making investments in new architectures and product offerings in january 2014 the board of directors declared a cash dividend of 0225 per common share to be paid in q1 2014  

looking ahead to 2014 we expect revenue and gross margin to remain flat we believe our product offerings and architectures will enable innovation and allow for future growth in the pc market through allinones 2 in 1s convertibles and detachables the launch of new lowpower highperformance products will continue to expand our footprint in tablets and our internet of things business we also continue to make progress with the industry’s first 14nm manufacturing process and our second generation 3d transistors codenamed “broadwell” our second generation 3d transistors will begin production in q1 2014 and is expected to launch in the second half of 2014 as we continue to align resources to focus on tablets lowpower socs and the data center we will also streamline our overall investment position in order to hold spending flat for the year   

our business outlook for q1 2014 and fullyear 2014 includes where applicable our current expectations for revenue gross margin percentage spending rd plus mga and capital expenditures we will keep our most current business outlook publicly available on our investor relations web site wwwintccom  this business outlook is not incorporated by reference in this form 10k we expect that our corporate representatives will from time to time meet publicly or privately with investors and others and may reiterate the forwardlooking statements contained in the business outlook or in this form 10k 

the statements in the business outlook and forwardlooking statements in this form 10k are subject to revision during the course of the year in our quarterly earnings releases and sec filings and at other times the forwardlooking statements in the business outlook will be effective through the close of business on march 14 2014 unless updated earlier from the close of business on march 14 2014 until our quarterly earnings release is published currently scheduled for april 15 2014 we will observe a “quiet period” during the quiet period the business outlook and other forwardlooking statements first published in our form 8k filed on january 16 2014 and other forwardlooking statements disclosed in the companys news releases and filings with the sec as reiterated or updated as applicable in this form 10k should be considered historical speaking as of prior to the quiet period only and not subject to update during the quiet period our representatives will not comment on our business outlook or our financial results or expectations the exact timing and duration of the routine quiet period and any others that we utilize from time to time may vary at our discretion 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

critical accounting estimates 

the methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our consolidated financial statements some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain our most critical accounting estimates include 

 in the following section we discuss these policies further as well as the estimates and judgments involved 

nonmarketable equity investments 

we regularly invest in nonmarketable equity instruments of private companies which range from earlystage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models the carrying value of our nonmarketable equity investment portfolio excluding equity derivatives totaled 23 billion  as of december 28 2013   22 billion  as of december 29 2012  

our nonmarketable equity investments are recorded using the cost method or the equity method of accounting depending on the facts and circumstances of each investment our nonmarketable equity investments are classified within other longterm assets on the consolidated balance sheets 

nonmarketable equity investments are inherently risky and their success depends on product development market acceptance operational efficiency and other key business factors the companies could fail or not be able to raise additional funds when needed or they may receive lower valuations with less favorable investment terms than previous financings these events could cause our investments to become impaired in addition financial market volatility could negatively affect our ability to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings mergers and private sales for further information about our investment portfolio risks see “risk factors” in part i item 1a of this form 10k 

we determine the fair value of our nonmarketable equity investments portfolio quarterly for disclosure purposes however the investments are recorded at fair value only if an impairment charge is recognized we determine the fair value of our nonmarketable equity investments using the market and income approaches the market approach includes the use of financial metrics and ratios of comparable public companies such as projected revenue earnings and comparable performance multiples the selection of comparable companies requires management judgment and is based on a number of factors including comparable companies’ sizes growth rates industries and development stages the income approach includes the use of a discounted cash flow model which requires significant estimates regarding the investees revenue costs and discount rates based on the risk profile of comparable companies estimates of revenue and costs are developed using available market historical and forecast data the valuation of these nonmarketable equity investments also takes into account variables such as conditions reflected in the capital markets recent financing activities by the investees the investees’ capital structures the terms of the investees’ issued interests and the lack of marketability of the investments 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

for nonmarketable equity investments the measurement of fair value requires significant judgment and includes quantitative and qualitative analysis of identified events or circumstances that impact the fair value of the investment such as 

 if the fair value of an investment is below our carrying value we determine whether the investment is otherthantemporarily impaired based on our quantitative and qualitative analysis which includes assessing the severity and duration of the impairment and the likelihood of recovery before disposal if the investment is considered to be otherthantemporarily impaired we write down the investment to its fair value impairments of nonmarketable equity investments were 112 million  in 2013   104 million  in 2012  and 63 million  in 2011

we assess property plant and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant underperformance of a business or product line in relation to expectations significant negative industry or economic trends and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets we measure the recoverability of assets that we will continue to use in our operations by comparing the carrying value of the asset grouping to our estimate of the related total future undiscounted net cash flows if an asset grouping’s carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows the asset grouping is considered to be impaired we measure the impairment by comparing the difference between the asset grouping’s carrying value and its fair value property plant and equipment is considered a nonfinancial asset and is recorded at fair value only if an impairment charge is recognized 

impairments are determined for groups of assets related to the lowest level of identifiable independent cash flows due to our asset usage model and the interchangeable nature of our semiconductor manufacturing capacity we must make subjective judgments in determining the independent cash flows that can be related to specific asset groupings in addition as we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions we must make subjective judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets primarily processspecific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements when we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated we accelerate the rate of depreciation over the assets’ new shorter useful lives based on our analysis impairments and accelerated depreciation of our property plant and equipment was 172 million  in 2013   73 million  in 2012  and 100 million  in 2011  

goodwill 

goodwill is recorded when the purchase price for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired goodwill is allocated to our reporting units based on relative fair value of the future benefit of the purchased operations to our existing business units as well as the acquired business unit reporting units may be operating segments as a whole or an operation one level below an operating segment referred to as a component our reporting units are consistent with the operating segments identified in “ note 27 operating segments and geographic information ” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

we perform an annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit in which goodwill resides is less than its carrying value for reporting units in which this assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than its carrying value goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test qualitative factors considered in this assessment include industry and market considerations overall financial performance and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

for reporting units in which the impairment assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying value we perform the first step of the goodwill impairment test which compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform additional analysis if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit then we must perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill if we determine during the second step that the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value we record an impairment loss equal to the difference 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions our goodwill impairment test uses a weighting of the income method and the market method to estimate a reporting unit’s fair value the income method is based on a discounted future cash flow approach that uses the following reporting unit estimates revenue based on assumed market segment growth rates and our assumed market segment share estimated costs and appropriate discount rates based on a reporting units weighted average cost of capital as determined by considering the observable weighted average cost of capital of comparable companies our estimates of market segment growth our market segment share and costs are based on historical data various internal estimates and a variety of external sources these estimates are developed as part of our routine longrange planning process the same estimates are also used in planning for our longterm manufacturing and assembly and test capacity needs as part of our capital budgeting process and for longterm and shortterm business planning and forecasting we test the reasonableness of the inputs and outcomes of our discounted cash flow analysis against available comparable market data the market method is based on financial multiples of comparable companies and applies a control premium a reporting unit’s carrying value represents the assignment of various assets and liabilities excluding certain corporate assets and liabilities such as cash investments and debt 

for the annual impairment assessment in 2013  we determined that for each of our reporting units with significant amounts of goodwill it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units exceeded the carrying value as a result we concluded that performing the first step of the goodwill impairment test was not necessary for those reporting units during the fourth quarter of each of the prior three fiscal years we have completed our annual impairment assessments and concluded that goodwill was not impaired in any of these years 

identified intangibles 

we make judgments about the recoverability of purchased finitelived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist recoverability of finitelived intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate we perform an annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each year for indefinitelived intangible assets or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist to determine whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable recoverability of indefinitelived intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future discounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate if we determine that an individual asset is impaired the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset 

the assumptions and estimates used to determine future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible and other longlived assets are complex and subjective they can be affected by various factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our forecasts for specific product lines based on our impairment assessment we recognized impairment charges of 17 million  in 2013   21 million  in 2012  and 10 million  in 2011  

income taxes 

we must make estimates and judgments in determining the provision for taxes for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes as well as the interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions significant changes in these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets if recovery is not more likely than not we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable we believe that we will ultimately recover the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets however should a change occur in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery is not more likely than not recovery of a portion of our deferred tax assets is impacted by management’s plans with respect to holding or disposing of certain investments therefore changes in management’s plans with respect to holding or disposing of investments could affect our future provision for taxes 

we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a twostep process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining whether the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any if we determine that a tax position will more likely than not be sustained on audit the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50  likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and may not accurately forecast actual outcomes determining whether an uncertain tax position is effectively settled requires judgment such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 

we have not recognized us deferred income taxes on certain undistributed nonus earnings because we plan to indefinitely reinvest such earnings outside the us remittances of nonus earnings are based on estimates and judgments of projected cash flow needs as well as the working capital and investment requirements of our nonus and us operations material changes in our estimates of cash working capital and investment needs in the various jurisdictions could require repatriation of indefinitely reinvested nonus earnings which would be subject to us income taxes and applicable nonus income and withholding taxes 

inventory 

intel has a product development lifecycle that corresponds with substantive engineering milestones these engineering milestones are regularly and consistently applied in assessing the point at which our activities and associated costs change in nature from rd to cost of sales in order for a product to be manufactured in high volumes and sold to our customers under our standard warranty it must meet our rigorous technical quality specifications this milestone is known as product release qualification prq we have identified prq as the point at which the costs incurred to manufacture our products are included in the valuation of inventory 

to determine which costs can be included in the valuation of inventory we must determine normal capacity at our manufacturing and assembly and test facilities based on historical loadings compared to total available capacity if the factory loadings are below the established normal capacity level a portion of our manufacturing overhead costs would not be included in the cost of inventory therefore it would be recognized as cost of sales in that period which would negatively impact our gross margin we refer to these costs as excess capacity charges excess capacity charges were 319 million  in 2013   540 million  in 2012  and 46 million  in 2011  

inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions productspecific facts and circumstances reviewed in the inventory valuation process include a review of our customer base the stage of the product life cycle of our products consumer confidence customer acceptance of our products and an assessment of selling price in relation to product cost if the estimated market value of the inventory is less than the carrying value we write down the inventory and record the difference as a charge to cost of sales 

the valuation of inventory also requires us to estimate obsolete and excess inventory as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality the demand forecast is utilized in the development of our shortterm manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuation and build decisions the estimate of future demand is compared to workinprocess and finished goods inventory levels to determine the amount if any of obsolete or excess inventory if our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly we could be required to write off inventory which would negatively impact our gross margin 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

loss contingencies 

we are subject to various legal and administrative proceedings and asserted and potential claims as well as accruals related to repair or replacement of parts in connection with product errata and product warranties that arise in the ordinary course of business an estimated loss from such contingencies is recognized as a charge to income if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated disclosure of a loss contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a material loss has been incurred the outcomes of legal and administrative proceedings and claims and the estimation of product warranties and asset impairments are subject to significant uncertainty significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether a loss is reasonably estimable with respect to estimating the losses associated with repairing and replacing parts in connection with product errata we make judgments with respect to the return rates to our customers our customers return rates and the costs to repair or replace parts at least quarterly we review the status of each significant matter and we may revise our estimates these revisions could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position

results of operations 

certain consolidated statements of income data as a percentage of net revenue for each period were as follows 



our net revenue for 2013 decreased by 633 million or 1 compared to 2012 the pccg and dcg platform unit sales decreased by 3 additionally lower netbook platform and feature and entry phone component unit sales contributed to the decrease these decreases were partially offset by higher pccg and dcg platform average selling prices which were up 2 as well as higher isg platform average selling prices 

our overall gross margin dollars for 2013 decreased by 16 billion or 5 compared to 2012 the decrease was due in large part to 18 billion of higher factory startup costs primarily for our nextgeneration 14nm process technology to a lesser extent lower overall revenue from our other ia operating segments primarily in our phone and mobile component businesses and netbook group as well as lower pccg and dcg platform revenue contributed to the decrease these decreases were partially offset by higher isg platform revenue approximately 325 million of lower pccg and dcg platform unit costs and 221 million of lower excess capacity charges 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

our overall gross margin percentage decreased to 598 in 2013 from 621 in 2012 the decrease in the gross margin percentage was primarily due to the gross margin percentage decrease in pccg we derived most of our overall gross margin dollars in 2013 and 2012 from the sale of platforms in the pccg and dcg operating segments 

our net revenue for 2012 which included 52 weeks decreased by 658 million or 1 compared to 2011 which included 53 weeks the pccg and dcg platform unit sales decreased 1 while average selling prices were unchanged additionally lower netbook platform unit sales and multicomm average selling prices primarily discrete modems contributed to the decrease these decreases were partially offset by our mcafee operating segment which we acquired in the q1 2011 mcafee contributed 469 million of additional revenue in 2012 compared to 2011 

our overall gross margin dollars for 2012 decreased by 606 million or 2 compared to 2011 the decrease was due in large part to 494 million of excess capacity charges as well as lower revenue from the pccg and dcg platform to a lesser extent approximately 390 million of higher unit costs on the pccg and dcg platform as well as lower netbook and multicomm revenue contributed to the decrease the decrease was partially offset by 643 million of lower factory startup costs as we transition from our 22nm process technology to rd of our nextgeneration 14nm process technology as well as 422 million of charges recorded in 2011 to repair and replace materials and systems impacted by a design issue related to our intel ®  6 series express chipset family the decrease was also partially offset by the two additional months of results from our acquisition of mcafee which occurred on february 28 2011 contributing approximately 334 million of additional gross margin dollars in 2012 compared to 2011 the amortization of acquisitionrelated intangibles resulted in a 557 million reduction to our overall gross margin dollars in 2012 compared to 482 million in 2011 primarily due to acquisitions completed in q1 2011 

our overall gross margin percentage in 2012 was flat from 2011 as higher excess capacity charges and higher unit costs on the pccg and dcg platform were offset by lower factory startup costs and no impact in 2012 for a design issue related to our intel 6 series express chipset family we derived a substantial majority of our overall gross margin dollars in 2012 and 2011 from the sale of platforms in the pccg and dcg operating segments 

pc client group 

the revenue and operating income for the pccg operating segment for each period were as follows 



net revenue for the pccg operating segment decreased by 15 billion or 4 in 2013 compared to 2012 pccg platform unit sales were down 3 primarily on softness in traditional pc demand during the first nine months of the year the decrease in revenue was driven by lower notebook and desktop platform unit sales which were down 4 and 2 respectively pccg platform average selling prices were flat with 6 higher desktop platform average selling prices offset by 4 lower notebook platform average selling prices 

operating income decreased by 13 billion or 10 in 2013 compared to 2012 which was driven by 15 billion of lower gross margin partially offset by 200 million of lower operating expenses the decrease in gross margin was driven by 15 billion of higher factory startup costs primarily on our nextgeneration 14nm process technology as well as lower pccg platform revenue these decreases were partially offset by approximately 520 million of lower pccg platform unit costs 260 million of lower excess capacity charges and higher sellthrough of previously nonqualified units 

net revenue for the pccg operating segment decreased by 11 billion or 3 in 2012 compared to 2011 pccg revenue was negatively impacted by the growth of tablets as these devices compete with pcs for consumer sales platform average selling prices and unit sales decreased 2 and 1 respectively the decrease was driven by 6 lower notebook platform average selling prices and 5 lower desktop platform unit sales these decreases were partially offset by a 4 increase in desktop platform average selling prices and a 2 increase in notebook platform unit sales 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

operating income decreased by 17 billion or 12 in 2012 compared to 2011 driven by 644 million of lower gross margin and 11 billion of higher operating expenses the decrease in gross margin was primarily due to lower platform revenue additionally 457 million of higher excess capacity charges and approximately 350 million of higher platform unit costs contributed to the decrease these decreases were partially offset by 785 million of lower factory startup costs as we transition from manufacturing startup costs related to our 22nm process technology to rd of our nextgeneration 14nm process technology additionally the first half of 2011 included  422 million  of charges recorded to repair and replace materials and systems impacted by the design issue related to our intel 6 series express chipset family 

data center group 

the revenue and operating income for the dcg operating segment for each period were as follows 



net revenue for the dcg operating segment increased by 727 million or 7 in 2013 compared to 2012 dcg platform average selling prices and unit sales were up 4 and 3 respectively our platform unit sales continued to benefit from growth in the internet cloud computing and high performance computing market segments 

operating income increased 144 million or 3 in 2013 compared to 2012 with 148 million of higher gross margin offset by higher operating expenses gross margin was positively impacted by higher platform revenue partially offset by 274 million of higher factory startup costs for our nextgeneration 14nm process technology and approximately 190 million of higher dcg platform unit costs 

net revenue for the dcg operating segment increased by 600 million or 6 in 2012 compared to 2011 the increase in revenue was due to 6 higher platform average selling prices slightly offset by 1 lower platform unit sales our platform average selling prices benefited from significant growth in the internet cloud computing and high performance computing market segments this was offset by weakness in the enterprise server market segment 

operating income decreased by 33 million in 2012 compared to 2011 as 356 million of higher gross margin was more than offset by 389 million of higher operating expenses the increase in gross margin was primarily due to higher platform revenue 

other intel architecture operating segments 

the revenue and operating income loss for the other intel architecture operating segments including isg multicomm the tablet group the phone group the service provider group the netbook group and the new devices group for each period were as follows 



net revenue for the other ia operating segments decreased by 286 million or 7 in 2013 compared to 2012 the decrease was primarily due to lower netbook platform feature and entry phone components and multicomm unit sales to a lesser extent lower multicomm average selling prices contributed to the decrease these decreases were partially offset by higher isg revenue on increased platform average selling prices 

operating results for the other ia operating segments decreased by 11 billion in 2013 compared to 2012 the decline in operating results was primarily due to approximately 590 million of higher operating expenses in the other ia operating segments on rd investments in our smartphone and tablet products as well as higher cost of sales as we ramp our tablet business additionally lower netbook platform and multicomm revenue contributed to the decrease these decreases were partially offset by higher isg revenue 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

net revenue for the other ia operating segments decreased by 627 million or 13 in 2012 compared to 2011 the decrease was primarily due to lower netbook platform unit sales and lower multicomm average selling prices to a lesser extent lower netbook platform average selling prices contributed to the decrease these decreases were partially offset by higher isg platform average selling prices 

operating results for the other ia operating segments decreased by 800 million from an operating loss of 577 million in 2011 to an operating loss of 14 billion in 2012 the decline in operating results was primarily due to lower netbook revenue and higher operating expenses in the other ia operating segments to a lesser extent lower multicomm revenue contributed to the decrease 

software and services operating segments 

the revenue and operating income loss for the ssg operating segments including mcafee the wind river software group and the software and services group for each period were as follows 



net revenue for the ssg operating segments increased by 121 million in 2013 compared to 2012 the increase was primarily driven by higher mcafee revenue 

the operating results for the ssg operating segments increased by 12 million in 2013 compared to 2012 the increase was primarily driven by higher mcafee revenue partially offset by higher mcafee operating expenses 

net revenue for the ssg operating segments increased by 511 million in 2012 compared to 2011 the increase was primarily due to two months of incremental revenue from mcafee of 469 million mcafee was acquired on february 28 2011 

the operating results for the ssg operating segments increased by 21 million in 2012 compared to 2011 the increase was primarily due to higher mcafee revenue partially offset by higher mcafee operating expenses 

operating expenses 

operating expenses for each period were as follows 



research and development rd spending increased  by 463 million  or 5  in 2013  compared to 2012  the increase  was driven by higher investments in our products primarily smartphones and tablets as well higher compensation expenses due to annual salary increases this increase  was partially offset by lower process development costs as we transitioned from rd to manufacturing for our 14nm process technology 

rd spending increased  by 18 billion  or 22  in 2012  compared to 2011  the increase  was driven by investments in our products for smartphones tablets ultrabook devices and data centers additionally rd spending increased due to higher process development costs for our 14nm process technology higher compensation expenses mainly due to annual salary increases additional expenses for acquisitions made in q1 2011 and higher costs related to the development of 450mm wafer technology 

marketing general and administrative mga expenses increased  by 31 million  in 2013  compared to 2012  and increased  by 387 million  or 5  in 2012  compared to 2011  the increase  in 2012  compared to 2011  was primarily due to two additional months of mcafee expenses in 2012 and higher compensation expenses due to annual salary increases as well as an increase in the number of employees 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

restructuring and asset impairment charges in response to the current business environment during 2013 management approved several restructuring actions including targeted workforce reductions as well as exit of certain businesses and facilities these actions include the wind down of our 200mm wafer fabrication facility in massachusetts which we expect to cease production by the end of 2014 these targeted reductions will enable the company to better align our resources in areas providing the greatest benefit in the changing market  

restructuring and asset impairment charges for each period were as follows 



the restructuring and asset impairment activity for 2013  was as follows   



we recorded the additional accruals and adjustments as restructuring and asset impairment charges in the consolidated statements of income within the “all other” operating segment the charges incurred during 2013  include   201 million   related to employee severance and benefit arrangements which impacted approximately 3900   employees the accrued restructuring balance as of december 28 2013  relates to employee severance and benefits which are expected to be paid within the next 12 months and was recorded as a current liability within accrued compensation and benefits in the consolidated balance sheets   

we estimate that employee severance and benefit charges to date will result in gross annual savings of approximately 400 million  which will be realized within rd cost of sales and mga we began to realize these savings in q4 2013 and expect to fully realize these savings by q1 2015 

we may incur additional charges in the future for employee severance and benefit arrangements as well as facilityrelated or other exit activities as we continue to align our resources to meet the needs of the business 

amortization of acquisitionrelated intangibles amortization of acquisitionrelated intangibles decreased  by 17 million  or 6  in 2013  compared to 2012  and increased  by 48 million  or 18  in 2012  compared to 2011  the increase  in 2012  compared to 2011  was primarily due to the full year of amortization of intangibles in 2012  related to the acquisitions of mcafee and the wls business of infineon both completed in q1 2011 for further information see “ note 8 acquisitions ” and “ note 11 identified intangible assets ” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

sharebased compensation 

sharebased compensation totaled 11 billion  in 2013   11 billion  in 2012  and 11 billion  in 2011  sharebased compensation was included in cost of sales and operating expenses 

as of december 28 2013  unrecognized sharebased compensation costs and the weighted average periods over which the costs are expected to be recognized were as follows 



as of december 28 2013  there was 13 million  in unrecognized sharebased compensation costs related to the rights to acquire common stock under our stock purchase plan we expect to recognize those costs over a period of approximately one and a half months 

gains losses on equity investments and interest and other 

gains losses on equity investments net and interest and other net for each period were as follows 



we recognized higher net gains on equity investments in 2013 compared to 2012 due to higher gains on sales of equity investments partially offset by lower gains on thirdparty merger transactions net gains on equity investments were higher in 2012 compared to 2011 due to lower equity method losses and higher gains on thirdparty merger transactions partially offset by lower gains on sales of equity investments 

net gains on equity investments for 2013 included gains of 439 million  on the sales of our interest in clearwire communications llc clearwire llc and our shares in clearwire corporation in q3 2013 for further information on these transactions see  note 5 cash and investments  in part ii item 8 of this form 10k net gains on equity investments for 2011 included a gain of 150 million  on the sale of shares in vmware inc our share of equity method investee losses recognized in 2011 was primarily related to clearwire llc  145 million  and these losses reduced our carrying value in clearwire llc to zero 

we recognized an interest and other net loss in 2013 compared to a net gain in 2012 we recognized a net loss in 2013 due to an increase in interest expense related to the issuance of our 62 billion  aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes in q4 2012 additionally in q2 2012 we received proceeds from an insurance claim related to the floods in thailand 

interest and other net decreased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to a 164 million  gain recognized upon formation of the intelge care innovations llc care innovations joint venture in q1 2011 and higher interest expense in 2012 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

provision for taxes 

our provision for taxes and effective tax rate for each period were as follows 



the us rd tax credit was reenacted in january 2013 retroactive to the beginning of 2012 the majority of the decrease in our effective tax rate was driven by the recognition of the 2012 us rd tax credit in q1 2013 the effective tax rate was also positively impacted by the recognition of the 2013 impact of the us rd tax credit partially offset by a lower percentage of our profits generated in lower tax jurisdictions in 2013  compared to 2012  

we generated a higher percentage of our profits from lower tax jurisdictions in 2012  compared to 2011  positively impacting our effective tax rate for 2012  this impact was partially offset by the us rd tax credit that was not reinstated during 2012

sources and uses of cash 

in millions 

  

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

in summary our cash flows for each period were as follows 



operating activities 

cash provided by  operating activities is net income adjusted for certain noncash items and changes in certain assets and liabilities 

for 2013  compared to 2012  the 19 billion   increase  in cash provided by operating activities was due to changes in working capital partially offset by lower net income in 2013 income taxes paid net of refunds in 2013 compared to 2012 were 11 billion   lower  due to lower income before taxes in 2013 and 2012 income tax overpayments 

changes in assets and liabilities as of december 28 2013  compared to december 29 2012  included lower income taxes payable and receivable resulting from a reduction in taxes due in 2013 and lower inventories due to the sellthrough of oldergeneration products partially offset by the ramp of 4th generation intel core processor family products 

for 2013  our three largest customers accounted for 44  of our net revenue  43  in 2012  and 2011  with hewlettpackard company accounting for 17  of our net revenue  18  in 2012  and 19  in 2011  dell accounting for 15  of our net revenue  14  in 2012  and 15  in 2011  and lenovo accounting for 12  of our net revenue  11  in 2012  and 9  in 2011  these three customers accounted for 34  of our accounts receivable as of december 28 2013   33  as of december 29 2012  

for 2012  compared to 2011  the 21 billion  decrease in cash provided by operating activities was due to lower net income and changes in our working capital partially offset by adjustments for noncash items the adjustments for noncash items were higher due primarily to higher depreciation in 2012 compared to 2011 partially offset by increases in nonacquisitionrelated deferred tax liabilities as of december 31 2011 

investing activities 

investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures investment purchases sales maturities and disposals as well as cash used for acquisitions 

the increase  in cash used for investing activities in 2013  compared to 2012  was primarily due to an increase in purchases of availableforsale investments and a decrease in maturities and sales of trading assets partially offset by an increase in maturities and sales of availableforsale investments and a decrease in purchases of licensed technology and patents our capital expenditures were 107 billion  in 2013   110 billion  in 2012  and 108 billion  in 2011  

cash used for investing activities increased in 2012  compared to 2011  primarily due to net purchases of availableforsale investments and trading assets in 2012 as compared to net maturities and sales of availableforsale investments and trading assets in 2011 partially offset by a decrease in cash paid for acquisitions net purchases of availableforsale investments in 2012 included our purchase of 32 billion  of equity securities in asml in q3 2012 

financing activities 

financing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases of common stock payment of dividends to stockholders issuance and repayment of longterm debt and proceeds from the sale of shares through employee equity incentive plans 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

the increase  in cash used for financing activities in 2013  compared to 2012  was primarily due to the issuance of longterm debt in 2012 and fewer repurchases of common stock under our authorized common stock repurchase program in 2013 we have an ongoing authorization originally approved by our board of directors in october 2005 and subsequently amended to repurchase up to 45 billion  in shares of our common stock in the open market or negotiated transactions during 2013  we repurchased 21 billion  of common stock under our authorized common stock repurchase program compared to 48 billion  in 2012  as of december 28 2013  32 billion  remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization limit we base our level of common stock repurchases on internal cash management decisions and this level may fluctuate proceeds from the sale of shares through employee equity incentive plans totaled 16 billion  in 2013  compared to 21 billion  in 2012  our total dividend payments were 45 billion  in 2013  compared to 44 billion  in 2012  we have paid a cash dividend in each of the past 85  quarters in january 2014  our board of directors declared a cash dividend of 0225  per common share for q1 2014  the dividend is payable on march 1 2014  to stockholders of record on february 7 2014  

the decrease in cash used for financing activities in 2012  compared to 2011  was primarily due to fewer repurchases of common stock under our authorized common stock repurchase program and to a lesser extent the issuance of a higher amount of longterm debt in 2012 compared to 2011 

liquidity 

cash generated by operations is our primary source of liquidity we maintain a diverse investment portfolio that we continually analyze based on issuer industry and country as of december 28 2013  cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and marketable debt instruments included in trading assets totaled 201 billion   182 billion  as of december 29 2012  in addition to the 201 billion  we have 19 billion  in other longterm investments and reverse repurchase agreements with original maturities greater than approximately three months that we include when assessing our sources of liquidity most  of our investments in debt instruments are in aa2 or better  rated issuances and the majority  of the issuances are rated aaaa3 or better  

our commercial paper program provides another potential source of liquidity we have an ongoing authorization from our board of directors to borrow up to 30 billion  including through the issuance of commercial paper maximum borrowings under our commercial paper program during 2013  were 300 million  although no commercial paper remained outstanding as of december 28 2013  our commercial paper was rated a1  by standard  poor’s and p1  by moody’s as of december 28 2013  we also have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the sec pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt equity and other securities in 2012 we utilized this shelf registration statement and issued 62 billion  aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes the proceeds from the sale of these notes were used for general corporate purposes and to repurchase shares of our common stock pursuant to our authorized common stock repurchase program for further information on the terms of the notes see “ note 16 borrowings ” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

as of december 28 2013  113 billion  of our cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and marketable debt instruments included in trading assets was held by our nonus subsidiaries of the 113 billion  held by our nonus subsidiaries approximately 21 billion  was available for use in the us without incurring additional us income taxes in excess of the amounts already accrued in our financial statements as of december 28 2013  the remaining amount of nonus cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and marketable debt instruments included in trading assets has been indefinitely reinvested and therefore no us current or deferred taxes have been accrued and this amount is earmarked for nearterm investment in our operations outside the us and future acquisitions of nonus entities we believe our us sources of cash and liquidity are sufficient to meet our business needs in the us and do not expect that we will need to repatriate the funds we have designated as indefinitely reinvested outside the us under current tax laws should our plans change and we were to choose to repatriate some or all of the funds we have designated as indefinitely reinvested outside the us such amounts would be subject to us income taxes and applicable nonus income and withholding taxes 

we believe that we have the financial resources needed to meet business requirements for the next 12 months including capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test working capital requirements and potential dividends common stock repurchases acquisitions and strategic investments 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

fair value of financial instruments 

when determining fair value we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and we consider assumptions such as an obligor’s credit risk that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability for further information see “fair value” in “ note 2 accounting policies ” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

marketable debt instruments 

as of december 28 2013  our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included 203 billion  of marketable debt instruments of these instruments 72 billion  was classified as level 1 130 billion  as level 2 and 59 million  as level 3 

our balance of marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 1 was classified as such due to the use of observable market prices for identical securities that are traded in active markets we evaluate securityspecific market data when determining whether the market for a debt security is active 

of the 130 billion  of marketable debt instruments measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 2 approximately 60  was classified as level 2 due to the use of a discounted cash flow model and approximately 40  was classified as such due to the use of nonbinding market consensus prices that were corroborated with observable market data 

our marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 3 are classified as such because the fair values are generally derived from discounted cash flow models performed either by us or our pricing providers using inputs that we are unable to corroborate with observable market data we monitor and review the inputs and results of these valuation models to ensure the fair value measurements are reasonable and consistent with market experience in similar asset classes 

loans receivable and reverse repurchase agreements 

as of december 28 2013  our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included 805 million  of loans receivable and 400 million  of reverse repurchase agreements all of these investments were classified as level 2 as the fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data 

marketable equity securities 

as of december 28 2013  our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included 62 billion  of marketable equity securities all of these securities were classified as level 1 because the valuations were based on quoted prices for identical securities in active markets our assessment of an active market for our marketable equity securities generally takes into consideration the number of days that each individual equity security trades over a specified period 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of december 28 2013  



 contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services included in other purchase obligations and commitments in the preceding table include agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on intel and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction for obligations with cancellation provisions the amounts included in the preceding table were limited to the noncancelable portion of the agreement terms or the minimum cancellation fee 

we have entered into certain agreements for the purchase of raw materials that specify minimum prices and quantities based on a percentage of the total available market or based on a percentage of our future purchasing requirements due to the uncertainty of the future market and our future purchasing requirements as well as the nonbinding nature of these agreements obligations under these agreements are not included in the preceding table our purchase orders for other products are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons in addition some of our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

contractual obligations that are contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones are not included in the preceding table these obligations include milestonebased comarketing agreements contingent fundingpayment obligations and milestonebased equity investment funding these arrangements are not considered contractual obligations until the milestone is met by the third party during 2012 we entered into a series of agreements with asml intended to accelerate the development of 450mm wafer technology and euv lithography  intel agreed to provide rd funding totaling €829 million  over five years and committed to advance purchase orders for a specified number of tools from asml  our remaining obligation contingent upon asml achieving certain milestones is approximately €738 million  or 10 billion  as of december 28 2013  as our obligation is contingent upon asml achieving certain milestones we have not included this obligation in the preceding table 

for the majority of restricted stock units granted the number of shares issued on the date the restricted stock units vest is net of the minimum statutory withholding requirements that we pay in cash to the appropriate taxing authorities on behalf of our employees the obligation to pay the relevant taxing authority is not included in the preceding table as the amount is contingent upon continued employment in addition the amount of the obligation is unknown as it is based in part on the market price of our common stock when the awards vest 

the expected timing of payments of the obligations in the preceding table is estimated based on current information timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations 

offbalancesheet arrangements 

as of december 28 2013  we did not have any significant offbalancesheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk 




 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend we are affected by changes in nonus currency exchange rates interest rates and equity prices all of the potential changes presented below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial positions as of december 28 2013  and december 29 2012  actual results may differ materially 

currency exchange rates 

in general we economically hedge currency risks of nonusdollardenominated investments in debt instruments and loans receivable with currency forward contracts or currency interest rate swaps gains and losses on these nonuscurrency investments are generally offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments 

substantially all of our revenue is transacted in us dollars however a significant amount of our operating expenditures and capital purchases is incurred in or exposed to other currencies primarily the euro the japanese yen and the israeli shekel we have established balance sheet and forecasted transaction currency risk management programs to protect against fluctuations in fair value and the volatility of the functional currency equivalent of future cash flows caused by changes in exchange rates  we generally utilize currency forward contracts in these hedging programs these programs reduce but do not eliminate the impact of currency exchange movements  for further information see “risk factors” in part i item 1a of this form 10k we considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that a weighted average adverse change of 20  in currency exchange rates could be experienced in the near term such an adverse change after taking into account balance sheet hedges only and offsetting recorded monetary asset and liability positions would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before taxes of less than 40 million  as of december 28 2013  less than 80 million  as of december 29 2012  

interest rates 

we generally hedge interest rate risks of fixedrate debt instruments with interest rate swaps gains and losses on these investments are generally offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments 

we are exposed to interest rate risk related to our investment portfolio and indebtedness our indebtedness includes our debt issuances and the liability associated with a longterm patent crosslicense agreement with nvidia corporation the primary objective of our investments in debt instruments is to preserve principal while maximizing yields which generally track the us dollar threemonth libor a hypothetical decrease in interest rates of up to 10  would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our indebtedness of approximately 11 billion  as of december 28 2013  an increase of approximately 15 billion  as of december 29 2012  a hypothetical decrease in benchmark interest rates of up to 10  after taking into account investment hedges would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our investment portfolio of approximately 10 million  as of december 28 2013  an increase of approximately 10 million  as of december 29 2012  the fluctuations in fair value of our investment portfolio and indebtedness reflect only the direct impact of the change in interest rates other economic variables such as equity market fluctuations and changes in relative credit risk could result in a significantly higher decline in the fair value of our net investment position for further information on how credit risk is factored into the valuation of our investment portfolio and debt issuances see “ note 4 fair value ” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

equity prices 

our investments include marketable equity securities and equity derivative instruments we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our equity market exposure through hedging activities at the inception of the investment before we enter into hedge arrangements we evaluate legal market and economic factors as well as the expected timing of disposal to determine whether hedging is appropriate our equity market risk management program may include equity derivatives with or without hedge accounting designation that utilize warrants equity options or other equity derivatives 

we also utilize total return swaps to offset changes in liabilities related to the equity market risks of certain deferred compensation arrangements gains and losses from changes in fair value of these total return swaps are generally offset by the losses and gains on the related liabilities  

as of december 28 2013  the fair value of our marketable equity investments and our equity derivative instruments including hedging positions was 63 billion   44 billion  as of december 29 2012  our marketable equity investment in asml was carried at a total fair market value of 59 billion  or 94  of our marketable equity portfolio as of december 28 2013  our marketable equity method investments are excluded from our analysis as the carrying value does not fluctuate based on market price changes unless an otherthantemporary impairment is deemed necessary to determine reasonably possible decreases in the market value of our marketable equity investments we have analyzed the historical market price sensitivity of our marketable equity investment portfolio assuming a loss of 25  in market prices and after reflecting the impact of hedges and offsetting positions the aggregate value of our marketable equity investments could decrease by approximately 16 billion  based on the value as of december 28 2013  a decrease in value of approximately 16 billion  based on the value as of december 29 2012  using an assumed loss of 35  

many of the same factors that could result in an adverse movement of equity market prices affect our nonmarketable equity investments although we cannot always quantify the impact directly financial markets are volatile which could negatively affect the prospects of the companies we invest in their ability to raise additional capital and the likelihood of our ability to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings mergers and private sales these types of investments involve a great deal of risk and there can be no assurance that any specific company will grow or become successful consequently we could lose all or part of our investment our nonmarketable equity investments excluding investments accounted for under the equity method had a carrying amount of 13 billion  as of december 28 2013   12 billion  as of december 29 2012  the carrying amount of our nonmarketable equity method investments was 10 billion  as of december 28 2013   10 billion  as of december 29 2012  the majority of our nonmarketable equity method investments balance as of december 28 2013  was concentrated in our imft investment of 646 million   642 million  as of december 29 2012

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act that occurred during the quarter ended december 28 2013  that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

management report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 

management assessed our internal control over financial reporting as of december 28 2013  the end of our fiscal year management based its assessment on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 1992 framework management’s assessment included evaluation of elements such as the design and operating effectiveness of key financial reporting controls process documentation accounting policies and our overall control environment 

based on this assessment management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the fiscal year to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles we reviewed the results of management’s assessment with the audit committee of our board of directors 

our independent registered public accounting firm ernst  young llp independently assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as stated in the firm’s attestation report which is included at the end of part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

our management including the ceo and cfo does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures

products 

platforms 

we offer platforms that incorporate various components and technologies including a microprocessor and chipset or standalone soc additionally a platform may be enhanced by additional hardware software and services 

a microprocessor—the central processing unit cpu of a computer system—processes system data and controls other devices in the system we offer microprocessors with one or multiple processor cores multicore microprocessors can enable improved multitasking and energyefficient performance by distributing computing tasks across two or more cores our 2nd 3rd and expectedtobereleased 4th generation intel ® core ™ formerly codenamed haswell processor families integrate graphics functionality onto the processor die in contrast some of our previousgeneration processors incorporated a separate graphics chip inside the processor package we also offer graphics functionality as part of a separate chipset outside the processor package processor packages may also integrate a memory controller 

a chipset sends data between the microprocessor and input display and storage devices such as the keyboard mouse monitor hard drive or solidstate drive and optical disc drives chipsets extend the audio video and other capabilities of many systems and perform essential logic functions such as balancing the performance of the system and removing bottlenecks some chipsets may also include graphics functionality or a memory controller for use with our microprocessors that do not integrate those system components 

we offer and continue to develop soc products that integrate our core processing functions with other system components such as graphics audio and video onto a single chip soc products are designed to reduce total cost of ownership provide improved performance due to higher integration and lower power consumption and enable smaller form factors such as smartphones and tablets 

we also offer features designed to improve our platform capabilities for example we offer intel ® vpro ™ technology a computer hardwarebased security technology for the notebook and desktop market segments this technology is designed to provide businesses with increased manageability upgradeability energyefficient performance and security while lowering the total cost of ownership 

 

  

we offer a range of platforms based upon the following microprocessors 

 

  

mcafee 

in 2011 we acquired mcafee inc with the objective of improving the overall security of our platforms mcafee offers software products that provide security solutions designed to protect systems in consumer mobile and corporate environments from malicious virus attacks as well as loss of data mcafee’s products include software solutions for endpoint security network and content security risk and compliance and consumer and mobile security

products and product strategy by operating segment 

our pc client group operating segment offers products that are incorporated in notebook including ultrabook  detachable and convertible systems and desktop computers for consumers and businesses in 2012 we introduced the 3rd generation intel ® core ™ processor family for use in notebook and desktop computers these processors use 22nanometer nm transistors and our trigate transistor processor technology our trigate transistor technology extends moore’s law and is the world’s first 3d trigate transistor on a production technology these enhancements in combination can provide significant power savings and performance gains when compared to previousgeneration technologies 

notebook 

our strategy for the notebook computing market segment is to offer notebook pc technologies designed to improve performance battery life wireless connectivity manageability and security as well as to allow for the design of smaller lighter and thinner form factors additionally we are collaborating with others in the industry to integrate a touchbased interface and recognition features based on voice and gesture in 2013 we expect to introduce our 4th generation intel ® core ™ processor family we believe these processors will continue to deliver increasing levels of graphics performance and provide oems and end users with more choice in selecting processors with more processor cores graphics performance or both 

in addition to offering notebook pc technologies we have worked with our customers to help them develop a new class of personal computing devices that includes ultrabook detachable and convertible systems these computers combine the energyefficient performance and capabilities of today’s notebooks and tablets with enhanced graphics and perceptual computing features in a thin light and customizable form factor that is highly responsive and secure and that can seamlessly connect to the internet and other enabled devices we believe the renewed innovation in the pc industry that we fostered with ultrabook systems and expanded to other thin and light form factors will continue to blur the lines between tablets and notebooks so a consumer does not have to choose between the two 

desktop 

our strategy for the desktop computing market segment is to offer products that provide increased manageability security and energyefficient performance while lowering total cost of ownership for businesses the desktop computing market segment includes allinone desktop products which combine traditionally separate desktop components into one form factor additionally allinone computers have transformed into adaptable and flexible form factors that offer users increased customization and ease of use for desktop consumers we also focus on the design of products for highend enthusiast pcs and mainstream pcs with rich audio and video capabilities 

our data center group operating segment offers products designed to provide leading performance energy efficiency and virtualization technology for server workstation and storage platforms we are also increasing our focus on products designed for highperformance computing missioncritical computing and cloud computing services the cloud computing market segment refers to servers and other products that enable ondemand network access to a shared pool of configurable software services and computing devices such products include the introduction in 2012 of our manycore intel ® xeon phi ™ coprocessor with 60 or more highperformance lowpower intel processor cores as well as our server platform that incorporates our 32nm intel ® xeon ® processors supporting as many as 10 cores for server platforms the intel xeon phi coprocessors are positioned to boost the power of the world’s most advanced supercomputers allowing for trillions of calculations per second while the 32nm intel xeon processors provide faster throughput for cloud computingbased services in the data storage market segment we introduced 64bit intel atom microarchitecturebased soc solutions to focus on the emerging market for highly dense lowpower server configurations these products allow server rack space optimization and reduced energy costs with microservers that require less than 10 watts per server node 

our other intel architecture operating segments offer products designed to be used in the mobile communications embedded netbook tablet and smartphone market segments

competition 

the computing industry is evolving and as a result so is our competitive landscape our platforms based on intel ® architecture are positioned to compete across the spectrum of internetconnected computing devices from the lowestpower portable devices to the most powerful data center servers new competitors are joining traditional competitors in our core pc and server business areas where we are a leading provider while we face incumbent competitors in the adjacent market segments that we are pursuing such as smartphones and tablets competitors include advanced micro devices inc amd international business machines ibm oracle corporation as well as arm architecture licensees from arm limited such as qualcomm incorporated nvidia corporation samsung electronics co ltd and texas instruments incorporated the primary competitor for our mcafee family of security products and services is symantec corporation 

we face emerging business model competitors from oems that choose to vertically integrate their own proprietary semiconductor and software assets to some degree such as apple inc and samsung in doing so these oems may be attempting to offer greater differentiation in their products and increase their share of the profits for each finished product they sell unforeseen competitor acquisitions collaborations or licensing scenarios including injunctions or other litigation outcomes could also have a significant impact on our competitive position 

our products primarily compete based on performance energy efficiency integration innovative design features price quality reliability brand recognition and availability one of our important competitive advantages is the combination of our network of manufacturing assembly and test facilities with our global architecture design teams this network enables us to have more direct control over our processes quality control product cost production timing performance and manufacturing yield the increased cost of constructing new fabrication facilities supporting smaller transistor geometries and larger wafers has led to a smaller pool of companies that can afford to build and equip leadingedge manufacturing facilities most of our competitors rely on thirdparty foundries and subcontractors such as taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company ltd or globalfoundries inc for their manufacturing and assembly and test needs creating among other risks the potential for supply constraints and limited process technology differentiation between competitors using the same foundry 

manufacturing and assembly and test 

as of december 29 2012 56 of our wafer fabrication including microprocessors and chipsets was conducted within the us at our facilities in new mexico arizona oregon and massachusetts the remaining 44 of our wafer fabrication was conducted outside the us at our facilities in ireland china and israel wafer fabrication conducted within and outside the us is impacted by the timing of a facility’s transition to a newer process technology as well as a facility’s capacity utilization 

 

 

as of december 29 2012 we primarily manufactured our products in wafer fabrication facilities at the following locations 

 

   

as of december 29 2012 most of our microprocessors were manufactured on 300mm wafers using our 22nm and 32nm process technology as we move to each succeeding generation of manufacturing process technology we incur significant startup costs to prepare each factory for manufacturing however continuing to advance our process technology provides benefits that we believe justify these costs the benefits of moving to each succeeding generation of manufacturing process technology can include using less space per transistor reducing heat output from each 

transistor and increasing the number of integrated features on each chip these advancements can result in microprocessors that are higher performing consume less power and cost less to manufacture in addition with each shift to a new process technology we are able to produce more microprocessors per square foot of our wafer fabrication facilities the costs to develop our process technology are significantly less than adding capacity by building additional wafer fabrication facilities using older process technology 

 

  

we use thirdparty manufacturing companies foundries to manufacture wafers for certain components including networking and communications products in addition we primarily use subcontractors to manufacture boardlevel products and systems and smartphones we purchase certain communications networking products and mobile phone components from external vendors primarily in the asiapacific region 

following the manufacturing process the majority of our components are subject to assembly and test we perform our components assembly and test at facilities in malaysia china costa rica and vietnam to augment capacity we use subcontractors to perform assembly of certain products primarily chipsets and networking and communications products in addition we use subcontractors to perform assembly and test of our mobile phone components 

our nand flash memory products are manufactured by imft and micron technology inc using 20nm 25nm or 34nm process technology and assembly and test of these products is performed by micron and other external subcontractors for further information see “note 10 equity method and cost method investments” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

our employment practices are consistent with and we expect our suppliers and subcontractors to abide by local country law in addition we impose a minimum employee age requirement as well as progressive environmental health and safety ehs requirements regardless of local law 

we have thousands of suppliers including subcontractors providing our various materials and service needs we set expectations for supplier performance and reinforce those expectations with periodic assessments we communicate those expectations to our suppliers regularly and work with them to implement improvements when necessary where possible we seek to have several sources of supply for all of these materials and resources but we may rely on a single or limited number of suppliers or upon suppliers in a single country in those cases we develop and implement plans and actions to reduce the exposure that would result from a disruption in supply we have entered into longterm contracts with certain suppliers to ensure a portion of our silicon supply 

our products are typically manufactured at multiple intel facilities around the world or by subcontractors however some products are manufactured in only one intel or subcontractor facility and we seek to implement action plans to reduce the exposure that would result from a disruption at any such facility see “risk factors” in part i item 1a of this form 10k 

research and development 

we are committed to investing in worldclass technology development particularly in the design and manufacture of integrated circuits research and development rd expenditures were 101 billion in 2012 84 billion in 2011 and 66 billion in 2010 

our rd activities are directed toward developing the technology innovations that we believe will deliver our next generation of products which will in turn enable new form factors and usage models for businesses and consumers our rd activities range from designing and developing new products and manufacturing processes to researching future technologies and products 

as part of our rd efforts we plan to introduce a new microarchitecture for our notebook ultrabook system and intel xeon processors approximately every two years and ramp the next generation of silicon process technology in the intervening years we refer to this as our “ticktock” technology development cadence as subsequently illustrated in 2012 we started manufacturing products with our 4th generation intel ® core ™ microarchitecture a new microarchitecture using our existing 22nm threedimensional trigate transistor process technology 22nm process technology we are currently developing 14nm process technology our nextgeneration process technology and expect to begin manufacturing products using that technology in 2013 our leadership in silicon technology has enabled us to make moore’s law a reality 

 

  

 

  

our leadership in silicon technology has also helped expand on the advances anticipated by moore’s law by bringing new capabilities into silicon and producing new products optimized for a wider variety of applications we have accelerated the intel atom processorbased soc roadmap for smartphones tablets and other devices from 32nm through 22nm to 14nm we intend that intel atom processors will eventually be on the same process technology as our leadingedge products for both smartphones and tablets we expect that this acceleration will result in a significant reduction in transistor leakage lower active power and an increase in transistor density to enable more powerful smartphones and tablets with more features and longer battery life 

we focus our rd efforts on advanced computing technologies developing new microarchitectures advancing our silicon manufacturing process technology delivering the next generation of microprocessors and chipsets improving our platform initiatives and developing software solutions and tools our rd efforts are intended to enable new levels of performance and address areas such as energy efficiency security scalability for multicore architectures system manageability and ease of use we continue to make significant rd investments in the development of socs to enable growth in areas such as smartphones tablets and embedded applications for example we continue to build smartphone and tablet reference designs to showcase the benefits of intel architecture in addition we continue to make significant investments in wireless technologies graphics and hpc 

our rd model is based on a global organization that emphasizes a collaborative approach to identifying and developing new technologies leading standards initiatives and influencing regulatory policies to accelerate the adoption of new technologies including joint pathfinding conducted between researchers at intel labs and our business groups we centrally manage key crossbusiness group product initiatives to align and prioritize our rd activities across these groups in addition we may augment our rd activities by investing in companies or entering into agreements with companies that have similar rd focus areas as well as directly purchasing or licensing technology applicable to our rd initiatives an example of augmenting our rd activities is the series of agreements we entered into in the third quarter of 2012 with asml these agreements in which intel purchased asml securities and agreed to provide rd funding over five years are intended to accelerate the development of 450mm wafer technology and euv lithography additionally in the second quarter of 2012 we entered into agreements with micron to modify our joint venture relationship extending intel and micron’s nand joint development program and expanding it to include emerging memory technologies for further information see “note 6 availableforsale investments and cash equivalents” and “note 10 equity method and cost method investments” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

employees 

as of december 29 2012 we had 105000 employees worldwide 100100 as of december 31 2011 with approximately 51 of those employees located in the us 52 as of december 31 2011 

 

  

sales and marketing 

customers 

we sell our products primarily to oems and odms odms provide design andor manufacturing services to branded and unbranded privatelabel resellers in addition we sell our products to other manufacturers including makers of a wide range of industrial and communications equipment our customers also include those who buy pc components and our other products through distributor reseller retail and oem channels throughout the world 

our worldwide reseller sales channel consists of thousands of indirect customers—systems builders that purchase intel microprocessors and other products from our distributors we have a boxed processor program that allows distributors to sell our microprocessors in small quantities to these systemsbuilder customers boxed processors are also available in direct retail outlets 

in 2012 hewlettpackard company accounted for 18 of our net revenue 19 in 2011 and 21 in 2010 dell inc accounted for 14 of our net revenue 15 in 2011 and 17 in 2010 and lenovo group limited accounted for 11 of our net revenue 9 in 2011 and 8 in 2010 no other customer accounted for more than 10 of our net revenue during such periods for information about revenue and operating income by operating segment and revenue from unaffiliated customers by country see “note 28 operating segment and geographic information” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

sales arrangements 

our products are sold through sales offices throughout the world sales of our products are typically made via purchase order acknowledgments that contain standard terms and conditions covering matters such as pricing payment terms and warranties as well as indemnities for issues specific to our products such as patent and copyright indemnities from time to time we may enter into additional agreements with customers covering for example changes from our standard terms and conditions new product development and marketing privatelabel branding and other matters most of our sales are made using electronic and webbased processes that allow the customer to review inventory availability and track the progress of specific goods ordered pricing on particular products may vary based on volumes ordered and other factors we also offer discounts rebates and other incentives to customers to increase acceptance of our products and technology 

our products are typically shipped under terms that transfer title to the customer even in arrangements for which the recognition of revenue and related cost of sales is deferred our standard terms and conditions of sale typically provide that payment is due at a later date generally 30 days after shipment or delivery our credit department sets accounts receivable and shipping limits for individual customers to control credit risk to intel arising from outstanding account balances we assess credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis and from this analysis we establish credit limits and determine whether we will use one or more credit support devices such as a parent guarantee or standby letter of credit or credit insurance credit losses may still be incurred due to bankruptcy fraud or other failure of the customer to pay for information about our allowance for doubtful receivables see “schedule ii—valuation and qualifying accounts” in part iv of this form 10k 

most of our sales to distributors are made under agreements allowing for price protection on unsold merchandise and a right of return on stipulated quantities of unsold merchandise under the price protection program we give distributors credits for the difference between the original price paid and the current price that we offer on most products there is no contractual limit on the amount of price protection nor is there a limit on the time horizon under which price protection is granted the right of return granted generally consists of a stock rotation program in which distributors are able to exchange certain products based on the number of qualified purchases made by the distributor we have the option to grant credit for repair or replace defective products and there is no contractual limit on the amount of credit that may be granted to a distributor for defective products 

distribution 

distributors typically handle a wide variety of products including those that compete with our products and fill orders for many customers we also utilize thirdparty sales representatives who generally do not offer directly competitive products but may carry complementary items manufactured by others sales representatives do not maintain a product inventory instead their customers place orders directly with us or through distributors we have several distribution warehouses that are located in proximity to key customers 

 

  

backlog 

over time our larger customers have generally moved to leaninventory or justintime operations rather than maintaining larger inventories of our products we have arrangements with these customers to seek to quickly fill orders from regional warehouses as a result our manufacturing production is based on estimates and advance nonbinding commitments from customers as to future purchases our order backlog as of any particular date is a mix of these commitments and specific firm orders that are primarily made pursuant to standard purchase orders for delivery of products only a small portion of our orders is noncancelable and the dollar amount associated with the noncancelable portion is not significant 

seasonal trends 

historically our platform sales have been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year accelerating in the third quarter and peaking in the fourth quarter however our sales have not followed this trend over the past two years 

marketing 

our corporate marketing objectives are to build a strong wellknown intel corporate brand that connects with businesses and consumers and to offer a limited number of meaningful and valuable brands in our portfolio to aid businesses and consumers in making informed choices about technology purchases the intel ® core ™ processor family and the intel ® atom ™  intel ® pentium ®  intel ® xeon ®  intel ® xeon phi ™ and intel ® itanium ® trademarks make up our processor brands 

we promote brand awareness and generate demand through our own direct marketing as well as through comarketing programs our direct marketing activities include television print and internet advertising as well as press relations and social media consumer and trade events and industry and consumer communications we market to consumer and business audiences and focus on building awareness and generating demand for new form factors such as ultrabook systems and for increased performance improved energy efficiency and other capabilities such as internet connectivity and security 

purchases by customers often allow them to participate in cooperative advertising and marketing programs such as the intel inside ® program this program broadens the reach of our brands beyond the scope of our own direct marketing through the intel inside ® program certain customers are licensed to place intel logos on computing devices containing our microprocessors and processor technologies and to use 

our brands in their marketing activities the program includes a market development component that accrues funds based on purchases and partially reimburses the oems for marketing activities for products featuring intel brands subject to the oems meeting defined criteria these marketing activities primarily include television print and internet marketing we have also entered into joint marketing arrangements with certain customers 

intellectual property rights and licensing 

intellectual property ip that applies to our products and services includes patents copyrights trade secrets trademarks and maskwork rights we maintain a program to protect our investment in technology by attempting to ensure respect for our ip the extent of the legal protection given to different types of ip varies under different countries’ legal systems we intend to license our ip where we can obtain adequate consideration see “competition” earlier in this section “risk factors” in part i item 1a and “note 27 contingencies” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

we have obtained patents in the us and other countries while our patents are an important element of our success our business as a whole is not significantly dependent on any one patent because of the fast pace of innovation and product development and the comparative pace of governments’ patenting processes our products are often obsolete before the patents related to them expire in some cases our products may be obsolete before the patents related to them are granted as we expand our products into new industries we also seek to extend our patent development efforts to patent such products in addition to developing patents based on our own research and development efforts we purchase patents from third parties to supplement our patent portfolio established competitors in existing and new industries as well as companies that purchase and enforce patents and other ip may already have patents covering similar products there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain patents covering our own products or that we will be able to obtain licenses from other companies on favorable terms or at all 

the software that we distribute including software embedded in our componentlevel and platform products is entitled to copyright and other ip protection to distinguish our products from our competitors’ products we have obtained trademarks and trade names for our products and we maintain cooperative advertising programs with customers to promote our brands and to identify products containing genuine intel components we also protect details about our processes products and strategies as trade secrets keeping confidential the information that we believe provides us with a competitive advantage 

 

  

in the first quarter of 2011 we entered into a longterm patent crosslicense agreement with nvidia under the agreement we received a license to all of nvidia’s patents with a capture period that runs through march 2017 while nvidia products are licensed under our patents with the same capture period subject to exclusions for x86 products certain chipsets and certain flash memory technology products 

compliance with environmental health and safety regulations 

our compliance efforts focus on monitoring regulatory and resource trends and setting companywide performance targets for key resources and emissions these targets address several parameters including product design chemical energy and water use waste recycling the source of certain minerals used in our products climate change and emissions 

as a company we focus on reducing natural resource use the solid and chemical waste byproducts of our manufacturing processes and the environmental impact of our products we currently use a variety of materials in our manufacturing process that have the potential to adversely impact the environment and are subject to a variety of ehs laws and regulations over the past several years we have significantly reduced the use of lead and halogenated flame retardants in our products and manufacturing processes 

we work with the us environmental protection agency epa nongovernmental organizations ngos oems and retailers to help manage ewaste including electronic products nearing the end of their useful lives and to promote recycling the european union requires producers of certain electrical and electronic equipment to develop programs that let consumers return products for recycling many states in the us have similar ewaste takeback laws although these laws are typically targeted at the end electronic product and not the component products that we manufacture the inconsistency of many ewaste takeback laws and the lack of local ewaste management options in many areas pose a challenge for our compliance efforts 

we are an industry leader in our efforts to build ethical sourcing of minerals for our products including “conflict minerals” coming out of central africa in 2013 intel will continue to work to establish a “conflictfree” supply chain for our company and our industry in 2012 intel verified after reasonable inquiry that the tantalum we use in our microprocessors is “conflictfree” and our goal for the end of 2013 is to manufacture the world’s first verified “conflictfree” microprocessor 

we seek to reduce our global greenhouse gas emissions by investing in energy conservation projects in our factories and working with suppliers to improve energy efficiency we take a holistic approach to power management addressing the 

challenge at the silicon package circuit microarchitecture macro architecture platform and software levels we recognize that climate change may cause general economic risk for further information on the risks of climate change see “risk factors” in part i item 1a of this form 10k we see a potential for higher energy costs driven by climate change regulations this could include items applied to utility companies that are passed along to customers such as carbon taxes or costs associated with obtaining permits for our us manufacturing operations emission cap and trade programs or renewable portfolio standards 

we are committed to sustainability and take a leadership position in promoting voluntary environmental initiatives and working proactively with governments environmental groups and industry to promote global environmental sustainability we believe that technology will be fundamental to finding solutions to the world’s environmental challenges and we are joining forces with industry business and governments to find and promote ways that technology can be used as a tool to combat climate change 

we have been purchasing wind power and other forms of renewable energy at some of our major sites for several years we purchase renewable energy certificates under a multiyear contract this purchase has placed intel at the top of the epa’s green power partnership for the past four years and is intended to help stimulate the market for green power leading to additional generating capacity and ultimately lower costs 

distribution of company information 

our internet address is wwwintelcom  we publish voluntary reports on our web site that outline our performance with respect to corporate responsibility including ehs compliance 

we use our investor relations web site wwwintccom as a routine channel for distribution of important information including news releases analyst presentations and financial information we post filings as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the us securities and exchange commission sec including our annual and quarterly reports on forms 10k and 10q and current reports on form 8k our proxy statements and any amendments to those reports or statements all such postings and filings are available on our investor relations web site free of charge in addition our investor relations web site allows interested persons to sign up to automatically receive email alerts when we post news releases and financial information the sec’s web site wwwsecgov contains reports proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the sec the content on any web site referred to in this form 10k is not incorporated by reference in this form 10k unless expressly noted

 item 1a risk factors tableend changes in product demand may harm our financial results and are hard to predict 

if product demand decreases our revenue and profit could be harmed important factors that could cause demand for our products to decrease include changes in 

       our operations have high costs—including costs related to facility construction and equipment rd and employment and training of a highly skilled workforce—that are either fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term at the same time demand for our products is highly variable if product demand decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately we could be required to write off inventory or record excess capacity charges which would lower our gross margin our manufacturing or assembly and test capacity could be underutilized and we may be required to write down our longlived assets which would increase our expenses factoryplanning decisions may shorten the useful lives of facilities and equipment and cause us to accelerate depreciation if product demand increases we may be unable to add capacity fast enough to meet market demand these changes in product demand and changes in our customers’ product needs could negatively affect our competitive position and may reduce our revenue increase our costs lower our gross margin percentage or require us to write down our assets 

we operate in highly competitive industries and our failure to anticipate and respond to technological and market developments could harm our ability to compete 

we operate in highly competitive industries that experience rapid technological and market developments changes in industry standards changes in customer needs and frequent product introductions and improvements if we are unable to 

anticipate and respond to these developments we may weaken our competitive position and our products or technologies may be uncompetitive or obsolete as computing market segments emerge such as smartphones tablets and consumer electronics devices we face new sources of competition and customers with different needs than customers in our pc business some of our competitors in these market segments are pursuing a vertical integration strategy incorporating their soc solutions into the smartphones and tablets they offer which could make it less likely that they will adopt our soc solutions to be successful we need to cultivate new industry relationships in these market segments as the number and variety of internetconnected devices increase we need to improve the cost connectivity energy efficiency and security of our platforms to succeed in these market segments and we need to expand our software capabilities to provide customers with comprehensive computing solutions 

to compete successfully we must maintain a successful rd effort develop new products and production processes and improve our existing products and processes ahead of competitors our rd efforts are critical to our success and are aimed at solving complex problems and we do not expect all of our projects to be successful we may be unable to develop and market new products successfully and the products we invest in and develop may not be well received by customers additionally the products and technologies offered by others may affect demand for our products these types of events could negatively affect our competitive position and may reduce revenue increase costs lower gross margin percentage or require us to impair our assets 

changes in the mix of products sold may harm our financial results 

because of the wide price differences of platform average selling prices among our data center pc client and other intel architecture platforms a change in the mix of platforms among these market segments may impact our revenue and gross margin for example our pc client platforms that are incorporated in notebook and desktop computers tend to have lower average selling prices and gross margin than our data center platforms that are incorporated in servers workstations and storage products therefore if there is less demand for our data center platforms and a resulting mix shift to our pc client platforms our gross margins and revenue would decrease also more recently introduced products tend to have higher costs because of initial development costs and lower production volumes relative to the previous product generation which can impact gross margin 

 

  

our global operations subject us to risks that may harm our results of operations and financial condition 

we have sales offices rd manufacturing assembly and test facilities and other facilities in many countries and some business activities may be concentrated in one or more geographic areas as a result our ability to manufacture assemble and test design develop or sell products may be affected by 

      legal and regulatory requirements differ among jurisdictions worldwide violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation although we have policies controls and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws our employees contractors or agents may violate our policies 

although most of our sales occur in us dollars expenses such as payroll utilities tax and marketing expenses may be paid in local currencies we also conduct certain investing and financing activities in local currencies our hedging programs reduce but do not eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements therefore changes in exchange rates could harm our results of operations and financial condition changes in tariff and import regulations and in us and nonus monetary policies may harm our results of operations and financial condition by increasing our expenses and reducing revenue differing tax rates in various jurisdictions could harm our results of operations and financial condition by increasing our overall tax rate 

we maintain a program of insurance coverage for a variety of property casualty and other risks we place our insurance coverage with multiple carriers in numerous jurisdictions however one or more of our insurance providers may be 

unable or unwilling to pay a claim the types and amounts of insurance we obtain vary depending on availability cost and decisions with respect to risk retention the policies have deductibles and exclusions that result in us retaining a level of selfinsurance losses not covered by insurance may be large which could harm our results of operations and financial condition 

failure to meet our production targets resulting in undersupply or oversupply of products may harm our business and results of operations 

production of integrated circuits is a complex process disruptions in this process can result from errors difficulties in our development and implementation of new processes defects in materials disruptions in our supply of materials or resources and disruptions at our fabrication and assembly and test facilities due to accidents maintenance issues or unsafe working conditions—all of which could affect the timing of production ramps and yields we may not be successful or efficient in developing or implementing new production processes production issues may result in our failure to meet or increase production as desired resulting in higher costs or large decreases in yields which could affect our ability to produce sufficient volume to meet product demand the unavailability or reduced availability of products could make it more difficult to deliver computing platforms the occurrence of these events could harm our business and results of operations 

we may have difficulties obtaining the resources or products we need for manufacturing assembling and testing our products or operating other aspects of our business which could harm our ability to meet demand and increase our costs 

we have thousands of suppliers providing materials that we use in production and other aspects of our business and where possible we seek to have several sources of supply for all of those materials however we may rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers or upon suppliers in a single location for these materials the inability of suppliers to deliver adequate supplies of production materials or other supplies could disrupt our production processes or make it more difficult for us to implement our business strategy production could be disrupted by the unavailability of resources used in production such as water silicon electricity gases and other materials future environmental regulations could restrict the supply or increase the cost of materials that we use in our business and make it more difficult to obtain permits to build or modify manufacturing capacity to meet demand the unavailability or reduced availability of materials or resources may require us to reduce production or incur additional costs the occurrence of these events could harm our business and results of operations 

 

  

costs related to product defects and errata may harm our results of operations and business 

costs of product defects and errata deviations from published specifications due to for example problems in our design and manufacturing processes could include 

     these costs could be large and may increase expenses and lower gross margin our reputation with customers or end users could be damaged as a result of product defects and errata and product demand could be reduced the announcement of product defects and errata could cause customers to purchase products from competitors as a result of possible shortages of intel components or for other reasons these factors could harm our business and financial results 

third parties might attempt to breach our network security and our products and services which could damage our reputation and financial results 

we regularly face attempts by others to gain unauthorized access through the internet or to introduce malicious software to our it systems additionally malicious hackers may attempt to gain unauthorized access and corrupt the processes of hardware and software products that we manufacture and services we provide these attempts might be the result of industrial or other espionage or actions by hackers seeking to harm our company our products and services or users of our products and services due to the widespread use of our products and due to the high profile of our mcafee subsidiary we or our products and services are a frequent target of computer hackers and organizations that intend to sabotage take control of or otherwise corrupt our manufacturing or other processes products and services we are also a target of malicious attackers who attempt to gain access to our network or data centers or those of our customers or end users steal proprietary information related to our business products employees and customers or interrupt our systems and services or those of our customers or others we believe such attempts are increasing in number and in technical sophistication these attacks are sometimes successful and in some instances we our customers and the users of our products and services might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects we seek to detect and investigate such attempts and incidents and to prevent their recurrence where practicable through changes to our internal processes and tools andor changes or patches to our products and services but in some cases preventive and remedial action might not be successful such attacks 

whether successful or unsuccessful could result in our incurring costs related to for example rebuilding internal systems reduced inventory value providing modifications to our products and services defending against litigation responding to regulatory inquiries or actions paying damages or taking other remedial steps with respect to third parties publicity about vulnerabilities and attempted or successful incursions could damage our reputation with customers or users and reduce demand for our products and services 

we may be subject to theft loss or misuse of personal data about us or our customers or other third parties which could increase our expenses damage our reputation or result in litigation 

global privacy legislation enforcement and policy activity are rapidly expanding and creating a complex compliance environment the theft loss or misuse of personal data collected used stored or transferred by us to run our business could result in increased security costs or costs related to defending legal claims costs to comply with and implement privacyrelated and data protection measures could be significant our failure to comply with federal state or international privacyrelated or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others 

third parties may claim infringement of ip rights which could harm our business 

we may face ip rights infringement claims from individuals and companies including those who have acquired patent portfolios to assert claims against other companies we are engaged in a number of litigation matters involving ip rights claims that our products or processes infringe the ip rights of others could cause us to incur large costs to respond to defend and resolve the claims and they may divert the efforts and attention of management and technical personnel as a result of ip rights infringement claims we could 

    these actions could harm our competitive position result in expenses or require us to impair our assets if we alter or stop production of affected items our revenue could be harmed 

 

  

we may be unable to enforce or protect our ip rights which may harm our ability to compete and may harm our business 

our ability to enforce our patents copyrights software licenses and other ip rights is subject to general litigation risks as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our ip rights in various countries when we seek to enforce our rights we are often subject to claims that the ip rights are invalid not enforceable or licensed to the opposing party our assertion of ip rights often results in the other party seeking to assert claims against us which could harm our business governments may adopt regulations—and governments or courts may render decisions—requiring compulsory licensing of ip rights or governments may require products to meet standards that serve to favor local companies our inability to enforce our ip rights under these circumstances may harm our competitive position and business 

we may be subject to ip theft or misuse which could result in claims against us and harm our business and results of operations 

the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products the value of our investment in rd product development and marketing could be reduced and third parties might make claims against us related to losses of confidential or proprietary information or enduser data or system reliability these incidents and claims could severely disrupt our business and we could suffer losses including the cost of product recalls and returns and reputational harm 

our licenses with other companies and participation in industry initiatives may allow competitors to use our patent rights 

companies in the computing industry often bilaterally license patents between each other to settle disputes or as part of business agreements between them our competitors may have licenses to our patents and under current case law some of the licenses may permit these competitors to pass our patent rights on to others under some circumstances our participation in industry standards organizations or with other industry initiatives may require us to license our patents to companies that adopt industrystandard specifications depending on the rules of the organization we might have to grant these licenses to our patents for little or no cost and as a result we may be unable to enforce certain patents against others our costs of enforcing our licenses or protecting our patents may increase and the value of our ip rights may be impaired 

litigation or regulatory proceedings could harm our business 

we may face legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder consumer competition and other issues on a global basis as described in “note 27 contingencies” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k we are engaged in a number of litigation and regulatory matters litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain and adverse rulings 

could occur including monetary damages or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling products engaging in business practices or requiring other remedies such as compulsory licensing of patents 

we face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties 

we sell a portion of our products through third parties such as distributors valueadded resellers oems internet service providers and channel partners collectively referred to as distributors using third parties for distribution exposes us to many risks including competitive pressure concentration credit risk and compliance risks distributors may sell products that compete with our products and we may need to provide financial and other incentives to focus distributors on the sale of our products we may rely on one or more key distributors for a product and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue distributors may face financial difficulties including bankruptcy which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and financial results violations of fcpa or similar laws by distributors or other thirdparty intermediaries could have a material impact on our business failing to manage risks related to our use of distributors may reduce sales increase expenses and weaken our competitive position 

we face risks related to sales to government entities 

we derive a portion of our revenue from sales to government entities and their respective agencies government demand and payment for our products may be affected by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations government contracts are subject to oversight including special rules on accounting expenses reviews and security failing to comply with these rules could result in civil and criminal penalties and sanctions including termination of contracts fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business 

we invest in companies for strategic reasons and may not realize a return on our investments 

we make investments in companies around the world to further our strategic objectives and support key business initiatives these investments include equity or debt instruments of public or private companies and many of these instruments are nonmarketable at the time of our initial investment companies range from earlystage companies that are still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models the companies in which we invest may fail because they are unable to secure additional funding obtain favorable terms for future financings or participate in liquidity events such as public offerings mergers and private sales if any of these companies fail we could lose all or part of our investment if we determine that an otherthantemporary decline in the fair value exists for an investment we write down the investment to its fair value and recognize a loss impacting gains losses on equity investments net the majority of our marketable equity security portfolio balance is concentrated in asml and declines in the value of our asml holdings could result in impairment charges impacting gains losses on equity investments net 

 

  

our results of operations could vary as a result of the methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying accounting policies 

the methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying accounting policies have a large impact on our results of operations for more information see “critical accounting estimates” in part ii item 7 of this form 10k these methods estimates and judgments are subject to large risks uncertainties and assumptions and changes could affect our results of operations 

changes in our effective tax rate may harm our results of operations 

a number of factors may increase our effective tax rates which could reduce our net income including 

         decisions about the scope of operations of our business could affect our results of operations and financial condition 

changes in the business environment could lead to changes in the scope of our operations resulting in restructuring and asset impairment charges factors that could affect our results of operations and financial condition due to a change in the scope of our operations include 

 

     our acquisitions divestitures and other transactions could disrupt our ongoing business and harm our results of operations 

in pursuing our business strategy we routinely conduct discussions evaluate opportunities and enter into agreements for possible investments acquisitions divestitures and other transactions such as joint ventures acquisitions and other transactions involve large challenges and risks including risks that 

        when we decide to sell assets or a business we may have difficulty selling on acceptable terms in a timely manner and the agreedupon terms and financing arrangements could be renegotiated due to changes in business or market conditions these circumstances could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives or cause us to incur added expense or we may sell a business at a price or on terms that are less favorable than we had anticipated resulting in a loss on the transaction 

if we do enter into agreements with respect to acquisitions divestitures or other transactions we may fail to complete them due to factors such as 

  

 

  

our failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could harm our business and results of operations 

the manufacturing and assembly and test of our products require the use of hazardous materials that are subject to a broad array of ehs laws and regulations our failure to comply with these laws or regulations could result in 

    our failure to manage the use transportation emissions discharge storage recycling or disposal of hazardous materials could lead to increased costs or future liabilities environmental laws and regulations could also require us to acquire pollution abatement or remediation equipment modify product designs or incur other expenses many new materials that we are evaluating for use in our operations may be subject to regulation under environmental laws and regulations these restrictions could harm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter manufacturing and assembly and test processes 

climate change poses both regulatory and physical risks that could harm our results of operations and affect the way we conduct business 

in addition to the possible direct economic impact that climate change could have on us climate change mitigation programs and regulations can increase our costs the cost of perfluorocompounds pfcs—a gas that we use in manufacturing—could increase under some climatechangefocused emissions trading programs that may be imposed through regulation if the use of pfcs is prohibited we would need to obtain substitute materials that may cost more or be less available for our manufacturing operations airquality permit requirements for our manufacturing operations could become more burdensome and cause delays in our ability to modify or build additional manufacturing capacity under recently adopted greenhouse gas regulations in the us many of our manufacturing facilities have become “major” sources under the clean air act at a minimum this change in status results in some uncertainty as the epa adopts guidance on its greenhouse gas regulations due to the dynamic nature of our operations these regulations will likely result in increased costs for our us operations these cost increases could be associated with new air pollution control requirements and increased or new monitoring recordkeeping and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions we also see the potential for higher energy costs driven by 

climate change regulations our costs could increase if utility companies pass on their costs such as those associated with carbon taxes emission cap and trade programs or renewable portfolio standards while we maintain business recovery plans that are intended to allow us to recover from natural disasters or other events that can be disruptive to our business we cannot be sure that our plans will fully protect us from all such disasters or events many of our operations are located in semiarid regions such as israel and the southwestern us some scenarios predict that these regions may become even more vulnerable to prolonged droughts due to climate change 

in order to compete we must attract retain and motivate key employees and our failure to do so could harm our results of operations 

in order to compete we must attract retain and motivate executives and other key employees hiring and retaining qualified executives scientists engineers technical staff and sales representatives are critical to our business and competition for experienced employees in the semiconductor industry can be intense our current chief executive officer ceo plans to retire in may 2013 and the board of directors is working to choose a successor the succession and transition process may have a direct or indirect effect on business and operations in connection with the appointment of the new ceo we will seek to retain our executive management team some of whom are being considered for the ceo position and keep employees focused on achieving our strategic goals and objectives to help attract retain and motivate qualified employees we use sharebased incentive awards such as employee stock options and nonvested share units restricted stock units if the value of such stock awards does not appreciate as measured by the performance of the price of our common stock or if our sharebased compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit our ability to attract retain and motivate employees could be weakened which could harm our results of operations 

a number of factors could lower interest and other net harming our results of operations 

factors that could lower interest and other net in our consolidated statements of income include changes in fixedincome equity and credit markets foreign currency exchange rates interest rates credit standing of financial instrument counterparties our cash and investment balances and our indebtedness

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

  

overview 

our results of operations were as follows 

 

   

our revenue for 2012 was down 1 from 2011 and lower than we expected at the start of the year worldwide gross domestic product growth was less than expected as we entered 2012 and pc client group revenue was negatively impacted by the growth of tablets as these devices compete with pcs for consumer sales data center group revenue grew 6 in 2012 as a richer mix of products and significant growth in the internet cloud segment was partially offset by weakness in the enterprise market segment our gross margin percentage for 2012 was flat compared to 2011 as higher excess capacity charges and higher platform unit costs were offset by lower startup costs and no impact in 2012 for the intel ® 6 series express chipset design issue 

our fourth quarter revenue of 135 billion was flat from the third quarter of 2012 historically our revenue generally has increased in the fourth quarter however softness in pc demand and continued decline of inventory in the pc supply chain as oems reduce inventory on oldergeneration products negatively impacted our results for the fourth quarter the decline in our gross margin percentage in the fourth quarter was driven by excess capacity charges as we responded to lower demand by bringing down inventory levels and redirecting capital resources to our 14nm process technology our gross margin was also negatively impacted by higher inventory reserves on production of our nextgeneration microarchitecture products codenamed haswell which we expect to qualify for sale in the first quarter of 2013 

during 2012 we made significant product introductions across all our businesses including pc client servers smartphones and tablets and extended our manufacturing and process technology leadership we launched our nextgeneration serverbased products the intel xeon processor e5 family which provides higher performance and better energyefficiency than priorgeneration products in 2012 we continued to extend our process technology leadership with the introduction of our 22nm process technology products that utilize threedimensional trigate transistor technology these products also improve performance and energy efficiency compared to prior generation products and helped 

us accelerate our ultrabook strategy in 2012 we entered the smartphone market segment with six mobile phone providers launching the first intel architecturebased smartphones we are also expanding in the tablet market segment with designs based on android and windows operating systems currently shipping 

in a challenging environment our business continues to produce significant cash from operations generating 189 billion in 2012 we returned 44 billion to stockholders through dividends and repurchased 48 billion of common stock through our common stock repurchase program in addition we purchased 110 billion in capital assets as we continue to make significant investments to extend our manufacturing leadership during the third quarter of 2012 we also entered into a series of agreements with asml intended to accelerate the development of 450millimeter mm wafer technology and extreme ultraviolet euv lithography the agreements included intel’s purchase of asml equity securities totaling 32 billion we also took advantage of the low interest rate environment in 2012 and issued 62 billion of senior notes from a financial condition perspective we ended the year with an investment portfolio of 182 billion which consisted of cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and trading assets in january 2013 the board of directors declared a cash dividend of 0225 per common share for the first quarter of 2013 

as we look into 2013 we expect revenue to grow in the low single digits with particular strength in our server market segment we believe the renewed innovation in the pc industry that we fostered with ultrabook systems and expanded to other thin and light form factors will blur the lines between tablets and notebooks and provide growth opportunities in 2013 we also expect to launch new socs for smartphones and tablets based on our 22nm process technology in 2013 we expect an increase in capital expenditures primarily driven by beginning construction of a 450mm development facility as we progress toward manufacturing with 450mm wafer technology later in the decade

our business outlook for the first quarter and fullyear 2013 includes where applicable our current expectations for revenue gross margin percentage spending rd plus mga and capital expenditures we will keep our most current business outlook publicly available on our investor relations web site wwwintccom  this business outlook is not incorporated by reference into this form 10k we expect that our corporate representatives will from time to time meet publicly or privately with investors and others and may reiterate the forwardlooking statements contained in business outlook or in this form 10k the public can continue to rely on the business outlook published on the web site as representing our current expectations on matters covered unless we publish a notice stating otherwise the statements in business outlook and forwardlooking statements in this form 10k are subject to revision during the course of the year in our quarterly earnings releases and sec filings and at other times 

the forwardlooking statements in business outlook will be effective through the close of business on march 15 2013 unless updated earlier from the close of business on march 15 2013 until our quarterly earnings release is published currently scheduled for april 16 2013 we will observe a “quiet period” during the quiet period business outlook and other forwardlooking statements first published in our form 8k filed on january 17 2013 and other forwardlooking statements disclosed in the company’s news releases and filings with the sec as reiterated or updated as applicable in this form 10k should be considered historical speaking as of prior to the quiet period only and not subject to update during the quiet period our representatives will not comment on our business outlook or our financial results or expectations the exact timing and duration of the routine quiet period and any others that we utilize from time to time may vary at our discretion 

critical accounting estimates 

the methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our consolidated financial statements some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain our most critical accounting estimates include 



    in the following section we discuss these policies further as well as the estimates and judgments involved 

nonmarketable equity investments 

we regularly invest in nonmarketable equity instruments of private companies which range from earlystage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models the carrying value of our nonmarketable equity investment portfolio excluding equity derivatives totaled 22 billion as of december 29 2012 28 billion as of december 31 2011 

our nonmarketable equity investments are recorded using the cost method or the equity method of accounting depending on the facts and circumstances of each investment our nonmarketable equity investments are classified within other longterm assets on the consolidated balance sheets 

nonmarketable equity investments are inherently risky and their success depends on product development market acceptance operational efficiency the ability of the investee companies to raise additional funds in financial markets that can be volatile and other key business factors the companies could fail or not be able to raise additional funds when needed or they may receive lower valuations with less favorable investment terms than previous financings these events could cause our investments to become impaired in addition financial market volatility could negatively affect our ability to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings mergers and private sales for further information about our investment portfolio risks see “risk factors” in part i item 1a of this form 10k 

 

  

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

  

we determine the fair value of our nonmarketable equity investments portfolio quarterly for disclosure purposes however the investments are recorded at fair value only if an impairment charge is recognized we determine the fair value of our nonmarketable equity investments using the market and income approaches the market approach includes the use of financial metrics and ratios of comparable public companies such as projected revenues earnings and comparable performance multiples the selection of comparable companies requires management judgment and is based on a number of relevant factors including comparable companies’ sizes growth rates industries and development stages the income approach includes the use of a discounted cash flow model which may include one or multiple discounted cash flow scenarios and requires the following significant estimates for the investee revenue expenses capital spending and other costs and discount rates based on the risk profile of comparable companies estimates of revenue expenses capital spending and other costs are developed using available market historical and forecast data the valuation of our nonmarketable equity investments also takes into account variables such as conditions reflected in the capital markets recent financing activities by the investees the investees’ capital structures the terms of the investees’ issued interests and the lack of marketability of the investments 

for nonmarketable equity investments the measurement of fair value requires significant judgment and includes quantitative and qualitative analysis of identified events or circumstances that impact the fair value of the investment such as 

     if the fair value of an investment is below our carrying value we determine whether the investment is otherthantemporarily impaired based on our quantitative and qualitative analysis which includes assessing the severity and duration of the impairment and the likelihood of recovery before disposal if the investment is considered to be otherthantemporarily impaired we write down the investment to its fair value impairments of nonmarketable equity investments were 104 million in 2012 over the past 12 quarters including the fourth quarter of 2012 impairments of non marketable equity investments ranged from 8 million to 59 million per quarter 

longlived assets 

property plant and equipment 

we assess property plant and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant underperformance of a business or product line in relation to expectations significant negative industry or economic trends and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets we measure the recoverability of assets that we will continue to use in our operations by comparing the carrying value of the asset grouping to our estimate of the related total future undiscounted net cash flows if an asset grouping’s carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows the asset grouping is considered to be impaired we measure the impairment by comparing the difference between the asset grouping’s carrying value and its fair value property plant and equipment is considered a nonfinancial asset and is recorded at fair value only if an impairment charge is recognized 

impairments are determined for groups of assets related to the lowest level of identifiable independent cash flows due to our asset usage model and the interchangeable nature of our semiconductor manufacturing capacity we must make subjective judgments in determining the independent cash flows that can be related to specific asset groupings in addition as we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions we must make subjective judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets primarily processspecific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements when we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated we accelerate the rate of depreciation over the assets’ new shorter useful lives over the past 12 quarters including the fourth quarter of 2012 impairments and accelerated depreciation of property plant and equipment ranged from zero to 36 million per quarter 

goodwill 

goodwill is recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired goodwill is allocated to our reporting units based on relative fair value of the future benefit of the purchased operations to our existing business units as well as the acquired business unit reporting units may be operating segments as a whole or an operation one level below an operating segment referred to as a component our reporting units are consistent with the operating segments identified in “note 28 operating segment and geographic information” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

 

  

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

  

we perform an annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit in which goodwill resides is less than its carrying value for reporting units in which this assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than its carrying value goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test qualitative factors considered in this assessment include industry and market considerations overall financial performance and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit 

for reporting units in which the impairment assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying value we perform the first step of the goodwill impairment test which compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform additional testing if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit then we must perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill if we determine during this second step that the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value we record an impairment loss equal to the difference 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions our goodwill impairment test uses a weighting of the income method and the market method to estimate the reporting unit’s fair value the income method is based on a discounted future cash flow approach that uses the following reporting unit estimates revenue based on assumed market segment growth rates and our assumed market segment share estimated costs and appropriate discount rates based on the reporting units’ weighted average cost of capital as determined by considering the observable weighted average cost of capital of comparable companies our estimates of market segment growth our market segment share and costs are based on historical data various internal estimates and a variety of external sources these estimates are developed as part of our routine longrange planning process the same estimates are also used in planning for our longterm manufacturing and assembly and test capacity needs as part of our capital budgeting process and for longterm and shortterm business planning and forecasting we test the reasonableness of the inputs and outcomes of our discounted cash flow analysis against available comparable market data the market method is based on financial multiples of comparable companies and applies a control premium the reporting unit’s carrying value represents the assignment of various assets and liabilities excluding certain corporate assets and liabilities such as cash investments and debt 

for the annual impairment assessment in 2012 we determined that for each of our reporting units with significant amounts of goodwill it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units exceeded the carrying value as a result we concluded that performing the first step of the goodwill impairment test was not necessary for those reporting units during the fourth quarter of each of the prior three fiscal years we completed our annual impairment assessments and concluded that goodwill was not impaired in any of these years 

identified intangibles 

we make judgments about the recoverability of purchased finitelived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist recoverability of finitelived intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate we perform an annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each year for indefinitelived intangible assets or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist to determine whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable recoverability of indefinitelived intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future discounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate if we determine that an individual asset is impaired the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset 

the assumptions and estimates used to determine future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible and other longlived assets are complex and subjective they can be affected by various factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our forecasts for specific product lines based on our impairment reviews of our intangible assets we recognized impairment charges of 21 million in 2012 10 million in 2011 and no impairment charges in 2010 

income taxes 

we must make estimates and judgments in determining the provision for taxes for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes as well as the interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions significant changes in these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 

 

  

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

  

we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets if recovery is not likely we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable we believe that we will ultimately recover the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets however should a change occur in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely recovery of a portion of our deferred tax assets is impacted by management’s plans with respect to holding or disposing of certain investments therefore changes in management’s plans with respect to holding or disposing of investments could affect our future provision for taxes 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a twostep process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining whether the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any if we determine that a tax position will more likely than not be sustained on audit the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors such as changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law new audit activity and effectively settled issues determining whether an uncertain tax position is effectively settled requires judgment such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 

inventory 

the valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality the determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products the estimate of future demand is compared to workinprocess and finished goods inventory levels to determine the amount if any of obsolete or excess inventory as of december 29 2012 we had total workinprocess inventory of 22 billion and total finished goods inventory of 20 billion the demand forecast is included in the development of our shortterm manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuation and build decisions productspecific facts and circumstances reviewed in the inventory valuation process include a review of our customer base the 

stage of the product life cycle of our products consumer confidence and customer acceptance of our products as well as an assessment of the selling price in relation to the product cost if our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly we could be required to write off inventory which would negatively impact our gross margin 

to determine which costs can be included in the valuation of inventory we must determine normal capacity at our manufacturing and assembly and test facilities based on historical loadings compared to total available capacity if the factory loadings are below the established normal capacity level a portion of our manufacturing overhead costs would not be included in the cost of inventory therefore it would be recognized as cost of sales in that period which would negatively impact our gross margin we refer to these costs as excess capacity charges in the fourth quarter of 2012 excess capacity charges were 480 million in the previous 11 quarters excess capacity charges were less than 50 million in each quarter 

loss contingencies 

we are subject to various legal and administrative proceedings and asserted and potential claims as well as accruals related to repair or replacement of parts in connection with product errata and product warranties and potential asset impairments loss contingencies that arise in the ordinary course of business an estimated loss from such contingencies is recognized as a charge to income if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated disclosure of a loss contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a material loss has been incurred the outcomes of legal and administrative proceedings and claims and the estimation of product warranties and asset impairments are subject to significant uncertainty significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether a loss is reasonably estimable with respect to estimating the losses associated with repairing and replacing parts in connection with product errata we make judgments with respect to customer return rates costs to repair or replace parts and where the product is in our customer’s manufacturing process at least quarterly we review the status of each significant matter and we may revise our estimates these revisions could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position

results of operations 

the following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of income data as a percentage of net revenue for the periods indicated 

 

   

our net revenue for 2012 which included 52 weeks decreased by 658 million or 1 compared to 2011 which included 53 weeks pc client group and data center group platform volume decreased 1 while average selling prices were unchanged additionally lower imc average selling prices and lower netbook platform volume contributed to the decrease these decreases were partially offset by our mcafee operating segment which we acquired in the first quarter of 2011 mcafee contributed 469 million of additional revenue in 2012 compared to 2011 

our overall gross margin dollars for 2012 decreased by 606 million or 2 compared to 2011 the decrease was due in large part to approximately 490 million of excess capacity charges as well as lower pc client group and data center group platform revenue to a lesser extent higher pc client group and data center group platform unit costs as well as lower netbook and imc revenue contributed to the decrease the decrease was partially offset by approximately 645 million of lower startup costs as we transition from our 22nm process technology to rd of our nextgeneration 14nm process technology as well as 422 million of charges recorded in 2011 to repair and replace materials and systems impacted by a design issue related to our intel 6 series express chipset family the decrease was also partially offset by the two additional months of results from our acquisition of mcafee which occurred on february 28 2011 contributing approximately 334 million of additional gross margin dollars in 2012 compared to 2011 the amortization of acquisitionrelated intangibles resulted in a 557 million 

reduction to our overall gross margin dollars in 2012 compared to 482 million in 2011 primarily due to acquisitions completed in the first quarter of 2011 

our overall gross margin percentage in 2012 was flat from 2011 as higher excess capacity charges and higher pc client group and data center group platform unit costs in 2012 were offset by lower startup costs and no impact in 2012 for the intel 6 series express chipset design issue we derived a substantial majority of our overall gross margin dollars in 2012 and 2011 from the sale of platforms in the pc client group and data center group operating segments 

our net revenue for 2011 which included 53 weeks increased 104 billion or 24 compared to 2010 which included 52 weeks pc client group and data center group platform revenue increased 63 billion on 8 higher average selling prices and 7 higher unit sales additionally 36 billion of the increase in revenue was due to acquisitions completed in the first quarter of 2011 primarily imc and mcafee 

our overall gross margin dollars for 2011 increased 53 billion or 18 compared to 2010 primarily reflecting higher revenue from our existing business and our acquisitions as discussed previously the increase was partially offset by approximately 10 billion of higher startup costs compared to 2010 the amortization of acquisitionrelated intangibles resulted in a 482 million reduction to our overall gross margin dollars in 2011 compared to 65 million in 2010 primarily due to the acquisitions in the first quarter of 2011 

 

  

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

  

our overall gross margin percentage decreased to 625 in 2011 from 653 in 2010 the decrease in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to the gross margin percentage decrease in the pc client group and to a lesser extent the gross margin percentage decrease in the other intel architecture operating segments we derived a substantial majority of our overall gross margin dollars in 2011 and most of our gross margin dollars in 2010 from the sale of platforms in the pc client group and data center group operating segments 

pc client group 

the revenue and operating income for the pc client group for the three years ended december 29 2012 were as follows 

 

 net revenue for the pccg operating segment decreased by 11 billion or 3 in 2012 compared to 2011 pccg revenue was negatively impacted by the growth of tablets as these devices compete with pcs for consumer sales platform average selling prices and unit sales decreased 2 and 1 respectively the decrease was driven by 6 lower notebook platform average selling prices and 5 lower desktop platform volume these decreases were partially offset by a 4 increase in desktop platform average selling prices and a 2 increase in notebook platform volume 

operating income decreased by 17 billion or 12 in 2012 compared to 2011 driven by 649 million of lower gross margin and 11 billion of higher operating expenses the 

decrease in gross margin was primarily due to lower platform revenue additionally approximately 455 million of higher excess capacity charges and higher platform unit costs contributed to the decrease these decreases were partially offset by approximately 785 million of lower startup costs as we transition from manufacturing startup costs related to our 22nm process technology to rd of our nextgeneration 14nm process technology additionally the first half of 2011 included 422 million of charges recorded to repair and replace materials and systems impacted by a design issue related to our intel 6 series express chipset family 

net revenue for the pccg operating segment increased by 51 billion or 17 in 2011 compared to 2010 platform average selling prices and unit sales increased 8 and 7 respectively the increase in revenue was due to notebook platform unit sales and notebook platform average selling prices which both increased 9 to a lesser extent an increase in desktop platform average selling prices of 6 and an increase in desktop platform unit sales of 4 also contributed to the increase in addition to the extra work week in 2011 our client business benefited from rising incomes that increased the affordability of pcs in emerging markets we also saw an increase in revenue as demand increased in the enterprise and emerging markets for higher performance and more energyefficient computing 

operating income increased by 18 billion in 2011 compared to 2010 as the gross margin increase of 24 billion was partially offset by 584 million of higher operating expenses the increase in gross margin was primarily due to higher platform revenue partially offset by approximately 960 million of higher startup costs as we transitioned into production using our 22nm process technology higher platform unit costs and inventory writeoffs as compared to 2010 also contributed to the offset

 net revenue for the other ia operating segments decreased by 627 million or 13 in 2012 compared to 2011 the decrease was primarily due to lower imc average selling prices and lower netbook platform volume to a lesser extent lower netbook platform average selling prices contributed to the decrease these decreases were partially offset by higher isg platform average selling prices 

operating results for the other ia operating segments decreased by 800 million from an operating loss of 577 million in 2011 to an operating loss of 14 billion in 2012 the decline in operating results was primarily due to lower netbook revenue and higher operating expenses in the other ia operating segments additionally lower imc revenue was largely offset by lower imc unit cost 

net revenue for the other ia operating segments increased by 20 billion or 64 in 2011 compared to 2010 the increase was primarily due to imc revenue an operating segment formed from the acquisition of the wls business of infineon in the first quarter of 2011 to a lesser extent higher isg platform unit sales also contributed to the increase these increases were partially offset by lower netbook platform unit sales 

operating results for the other ia operating segments decreased by 847 million from an operating income of 270 million in 2010 to an operating loss of 577 million in 2011 the decline in operating results was primarily due to higher operating expenses within each of the other ia operating segments partially offset by higher revenue

software and services operating segments 

the revenue and operating income loss for the ssg operating segments including mcafee the wind river software group and the software and services group for the three years ended december 29 2012 were as follows 

 

 net revenue for the ssg operating segments increased by 511 million in 2012 compared to 2011 the increase was primarily due to two months of incremental revenue from mcafee of 469 million mcafee was acquired on february 28 2011 

the operating loss for the ssg operating segments decreased by 21 million in 2012 compared to 2011 the decrease in operating loss was primarily due to higher mcafee revenue partially offset by higher mcafee operating expenses 

net revenue for the ssg operating segments increased by 16 billion in 2011 compared to 2010 the increase was due to revenue from mcafee which was acquired on february 28 2011 due to the revaluation of mcafee’s historic deferred revenue to fair value at the time of acquisition we excluded 204 million of revenue that would have been reported in 2011 if mcafee’s deferred revenue had not been written down due to the acquisition 

the operating loss for the ssg operating segments decreased by 143 million in 2011 compared to 2010 the decrease was due to higher revenue partially offset by higher operating expenses across each of the ssg operating segments due to the revaluation of mcafee’s historic deferred revenue to fair value at the time of acquisition we excluded revenue and associated costs that would have increased operating results by 190 million in 2011 

 

 

operating expenses

marketing general and administrative  marketing general and administrative expenses increased by 387 million or 5 in 2012 compared to 2011 and increased by 14 billion or 22 in 2011 compared to 2010 the increase in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to the full first quarter expenses of mcafee in 2012 and higher compensation expenses mainly due to annual salary increases as well as an increase in the number of employees the increase in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to the expenses of mcafee and imc higher compensation expenses based on an increase in the number of employees and higher advertising expenses including cooperative advertising expenses 

amortization of acquisitionrelated intangibles the increase in 2012 compared to 2011 of 48 million was primarily due to the full year of amortization of intangibles in 2012 related to the acquisitions of mcafee and the wls business of infineon both completed in the first quarter of 2011 the increase in 2011 compared to 2010 of 242 million was primarily due to the amortization of intangibles related to the acquisitions of mcafee and the wls business of infineon in 2011 for further information see “note 13 acquisitions” and “note 16 identified intangible assets” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k

 as of december 29 2012 there was 13 million in unrecognized sharebased compensation costs related to the rights to acquire common stock under our stock purchase plan we expect to recognize those costs over a period of approximately one and a half months 

gains losses on equity investments and interest and other 

gains losses on equity investments net and interest and other net for the three years ended december 29 2012 were as follows 

 

 net gains on equity investments were higher in 2012 compared to 2011 due to lower equity method losses and higher gains on thirdparty merger transactions partially offset by lower gains on sales of equity investments we recognized lower net gains on equity investments in 2011 compared to 2010 due to lower gains on sales of equity investments higher equity method losses and lower gains on thirdparty merger transactions 

net gains on equity investments for 2011 included a gain of 150 million on the sale of shares in vmware inc during 2010 we recognized a gain of 181 million on the initial public offering of smart technologies inc and the subsequent partial sale of our shares in the secondary offering we also recognized a gain of 91 million on the sale of our ownership interest in numonyx bv and a gain of 67 million on the sale of shares in micron technology inc in 2010 our share of equity method investee losses recognized in 2011 and 2010 was primarily related to clearwire communications llc clearwire llc 145 million and 116 million respectively our share of equity method investee losses recognized in 2011 reduced our carrying value in clearwire llc to zero we do not expect to recognize additional equity method losses for clearwire llc in the future 

interest and other net decreased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to a 164 million gain recognized upon formation of the intelge care innovations llc care innovations joint venture during the first quarter of 2011 and higher interest expense in 2012 this decrease was partially offset by proceeds received from an insurance claim in the second quarter of 2012 related to the floods in thailand 

interest and other net increased in 2011 compared to 2010 the 164 million gain recognized upon formation of care innovations during 2011 was partially offset by the recognition of 41 million of interest expense in 2011 compared to zero in 2010 and lower interest income in 2011 compared to 2010 as a result of lower average investment balances we recognized interest expense during 2011 as the amount of interest incurred began to exceed the amount we were able to capitalize upon the issuance of 50 billion aggregate principal of senior unsecured notes in the third quarter of 2011 

 

  

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

  

provision for taxes 

our provision for taxes and effective tax rate were as follows 

 

 we generated a higher percentage of our profits from lower tax jurisdictions in 2012 compared to 2011 positively impacting our effective tax rate for 2012 this impact was partially offset by a us research and development tax credit that was not reinstated in 2012 

the us research and development tax credit was reenacted in january 2013 retroactive to the beginning of 2012 the full year 2012 impact of the us federal research and development tax credit will be recognized in the first quarter 2013 financial statements and is expected to have a significant positive impact on the first quarter of 2013 effective tax rate 

we generated a higher percentage of our profits from lower tax jurisdictions in 2011 compared to 2010 positively impacting our effective tax rate for 2011

sources and uses of cash 

in millions 

 

in summary our cash flows were as follows 

 

   

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

  

operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain noncash items and changes in certain assets and liabilities 

for 2012 compared to 2011 the 21 billion decrease in cash provided by operating activities was due to lower net income and changes in our working capital partially offset by adjustments for noncash items the adjustments for noncash items were higher due primarily to higher depreciation in 2012 compared to 2011 partially offset by increases in nonacquisitionrelated deferred tax liabilities as of december 31 2011 compared to december 25 2010 

changes in assets and liabilities as of december 29 2012 compared to december 31 2011 included higher inventories on the ramp of 3rd generation intel ® core ™ processor family products partially offset by a significant reduction in oldergeneration products 

for 2012 our three largest customers accounted for 43 of our net revenue 43 in 2011 and 46 in 2010 with hewlettpackard company accounting for 18 of our net revenue 19 in 2011 and 21 in 2010 dell accounting for 14 of our net revenue 15 in 2011 and 17 in 2010 and lenovo accounting for 11 of our net revenue 9 in 2011 and 8 in 2010 these three customers accounted for 33 of our accounts receivable as of december 29 2012 36 as of december 31 2011 

for 2011 compared to 2010 the 43 billion increase in cash provided by operating activities was due to adjustments for noncash items and higher net income the adjustments for noncash items were higher for 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to higher depreciation and amortization of intangibles as well as increases in nonacquisitionrelated deferred tax liabilities as of december 31 2011 compared to december 25 2010 income taxes paid net of refunds in 2011 compared to 2010 were 13 billion lower largely due to the tax benefit of depreciating 100 of assets placed in service in the us in 2011 

investing activities 

investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures investment purchases sales maturities and disposals as well as cash used for acquisitions 

the increase in cash used for investing activities in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to net purchases of availableforsale investments and trading assets in 2012 as compared to net maturities and sales of availableforsale 

investments and trading assets in 2011 partially offset by a decrease in cash paid for acquisitions net purchases of availableforsale investments in 2012 included our purchase of 32 billion of equity securities in asml during the third quarter of 2012 our capital expenditures were 110 billion in 2012 108 billion in 2011 and 52 billion in 2010 

cash used for investing activities decreased slightly in 2011 compared to 2010 a decrease due to net maturities and sales of availableforsale investments in 2011 as compared to net purchases of availableforsale investments in 2010 was offset by higher cash paid for acquisitions of which the substantial majority was for our acquisition of mcafee in the first quarter of 2011 and an increase in capital expenditures the significant increase in capital expenditures in 2011 compared to 2010 was due to the expansion of our network of fabrication facilities to include an additional largescale fabrication facility as well as bringing our 22nm process technology manufacturing capacity online 

financing activities 

financing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases of common stock payment of dividends to stockholders issuance and repayment of longterm debt and proceeds from the sale of shares through employee equity incentive plans 

the decrease in cash used for financing activities in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to fewer repurchases of common stock under our authorized common stock repurchase program and to a lesser extent the issuance of a higher amount of longterm debt in 2012 compared to 2011 we have an ongoing authorization since october 2005 as amended from our board of directors to repurchase up to 45 billion in shares of our common stock in the open market or negotiated transactions during 2012 we repurchased 48 billion of common stock under our authorized common stock repurchase program compared to 141 billion in 2011 as of december 29 2012 53 billion remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization limit we base our level of common stock repurchases on internal cash management decisions and this level may fluctuate proceeds from the sale of shares through employee equity incentive plans totaled 21 billion in 2012 compared to 20 billion in 2011 our total dividend payments were 44 billion in 2012 compared to 41 billion in 2011 as a result of an increase in quarterly cash dividends per common share we have paid a cash dividend in each of the past 81 quarters in january 2013 our board of directors declared a cash dividend of 0225 per common share for the first quarter of 2013 the dividend is payable on march 1 2013 to stockholders of record on february 7 2013 

 

  

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

  

the increase in cash used in financing activities in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to higher repurchases of common stock under our authorized common stock repurchase program partially offset by the issuance of longterm debt in 2011 and higher proceeds from the sale of shares through employee equity incentive plans 

liquidity 

cash generated by operations is our primary source of liquidity we maintain a diverse investment portfolio that we continually analyze based on issuer industry and country as of december 29 2012 cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and marketable debt instruments included in trading assets totaled 182 billion 148 billion as of december 31 2011 in addition to the 182 billion we have 15 billion in loans receivable and other longterm investments that we include when assessing our investment portfolio substantially all of our investments in debt instruments are in aa2 or better rated issuances and the majority of the issuances are rated aaaa3 or better 

our commercial paper program provides another potential source of liquidity we have an ongoing authorization from our board of directors to borrow up to 30 billion including through the issuance of commercial paper maximum borrowings under our commercial paper program during 2012 were 500 million although no commercial paper remained outstanding as of december 29 2012 our commercial paper was rated a1 by standard  poor’s and p1 by moody’s as of december 29 2012 we also have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the sec pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt equity and other securities in the fourth quarter of 2012 we utilized this shelf registration statement and issued 62 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes these notes were issued for general corporate purposes and to repurchase shares of our common stock pursuant to our authorized common stock repurchase program for further information on the terms of the notes see “note 19 borrowings” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

we believe that we have the financial resources needed to meet business requirements for the next 12 months including capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test working capital requirements and potential dividends common stock repurchases and acquisitions or strategic investments 

fair value of financial instruments 

when determining fair value we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and we consider assumptions such as an obligor’s credit risk that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability for further information see “fair value” in “note 2 accounting policies” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

marketable debt instruments 

as of december 29 2012 our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included 153 billion of marketable debt instruments of these instruments 52 billion was classified as level 1 100 billion as level 2 and 126 million as level 3 

our balance of marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 1 was classified as such due to the use of observable market prices for identical securities that are traded in active markets we evaluate securityspecific market data when determining whether the market for a debt security is active 

of the 100 billion of marketable debt instruments measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 2 approximately 60 was classified as level 2 due to the use of a discounted cash flow model and approximately 40 was classified as such due to the use of nonbinding market consensus prices that were corroborated with observable market data 

our marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 3 were classified as such due to the lack of observable market data to corroborate either the nonbinding market consensus prices or the nonbinding broker quotes when observable market data is not available we corroborate our fair value measurements using nonbinding market consensus prices and nonbinding broker quotes from a second source 

loans receivable and reverse repurchase agreements 

as of december 29 2012 our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included 780 million of loans receivable and 28 billion of reverse repurchase agreements all of these investments were classified as level 2 as the fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data 

 

  

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

  

marketable equity securities 

as of december 29 2012 our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included 44 billion of marketable equity securities all of these securities were classified as level 1 because the valuations were based 

on quoted prices for identical securities in active markets our assessment of an active market for our marketable equity securities generally takes into consideration the number of days that each individual equity security trades over a specified period 

 

 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of december 29 2012 

 

  

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services included in other purchase obligations and commitments in the preceding table include agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on intel and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction for obligations with cancellation provisions the amounts included in the preceding table were limited to the noncancelable portion of the agreement terms or the minimum cancellation fee 

we have entered into certain agreements for the purchase of raw materials that specify minimum prices and quantities based on a percentage of the total available market or based on a percentage of our future purchasing requirements due to the uncertainty of the future market and our future purchasing requirements as well as the nonbinding nature of these agreements obligations under these agreements are not included in the preceding table our purchase orders for other products are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons in addition some of our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 

 

  

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

  

contractual obligations that are contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones are not included in the preceding table these obligations include milestonebased comarketing agreements contingent fundingpayment obligations and milestonebased equity investment funding these arrangements are not considered contractual obligations until the milestone is met by the third party during 2012 we entered into a series of agreements with asml intended to accelerate the development of 450mm wafer technology and euv lithography intel agreed to provide rd funding totaling € 829 million approximately 11 billion as of december 29 2012 over five years and committed to advance purchase orders for a specified number of tools from asml our obligation is contingent upon asml achieving certain milestones as a result we have not included this obligation in the preceding table 

for the majority of restricted stock units granted the number of shares issued on the date the restricted stock units vest is net of the minimum statutory withholding requirements that we pay in cash to the appropriate taxing authorities on behalf of our employees the obligation to pay the relevant taxing authority is not included in the preceding table as the amount is contingent upon continued employment in addition the amount of the obligation is unknown as it is based in part on the market price of our common stock when the awards vest 

contractual obligations with regard to our investment in imft are not included in the preceding table we are currently committed to purchasing 49 of imft’s production output and productionrelated services we also have several agreements with micron related to the supply of nand flash memory products ip and rd funding related to nonvolatile memory manufacturing the obligation to purchase our proportion of imft’s inventory was approximately 28 million as of december 29 2012 for further information see “note 10 equity method and cost method investments” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

the expected timing of payments of the obligations in the table above is estimated based on current information timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations 

offbalancesheet arrangements 

as of december 29 2012 we did not have any significant offbalancesheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend we are directly and indirectly affected by changes in nonus currency exchange rates interest rates and equity prices all of the potential changes that follow are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial positions as of december 29 2012 and december 31 2011 actual results may differ materially 

currency exchange rates 

in general we economically hedge currency risks of nonusdollardenominated investments in debt instruments and loans receivable with currency forward contracts or currency interest rate swaps gains and losses on these nonuscurrency investments would generally be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments resulting in an insignificant net exposure to loss 

substantially all of our revenue is transacted in us dollars however a significant amount of our operating expenditures and capital purchases is incurred in or exposed to other currencies primarily the euro the japanese yen and the israeli shekel we have established balance sheet and forecasted transaction currency risk management programs to protect against fluctuations in fair value and the volatility of the functional currency equivalent of future cash flows caused by changes in exchange rates we generally utilize currency forward contracts in these hedging programs our hedging programs reduce but do not always eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements for further information see “risk factors” in part i item 1a of this form 10k we considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that a weighted average adverse change of 20 in currency exchange rates could be experienced in the near term such an adverse change after taking into account balance sheet hedges only and offsetting recorded monetary asset and liability positions would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before taxes of less than 80 million as of december 29 2012 less than 40 million as of december 31 2011 

interest rates 

we generally hedge interest rate risks of fixedrate debt instruments with interest rate swaps gains and losses on these investments would generally be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments resulting in an insignificant net exposure to interest rate loss 

we are exposed to interest rate risk related to our investment portfolio and indebtedness our indebtedness includes our debt issuances and the liability associated with a longterm patent crosslicense agreement with nvidia the primary objective of our investments in debt instruments is to preserve principal while maximizing yields which generally track the usdollar threemonth libor a hypothetical decrease in interest rates of 10 would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our indebtedness of approximately 15 billion as of december 29 2012 an increase of approximately 900 million as of december 31 2011 the significant increase from december 31 2011 was primarily driven by the inclusion of 62 billion of senior unsecured notes issued in the fourth quarter of 2012 a hypothetical decrease in benchmark interest rates of up to 10 after taking into account investment hedges would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our investment portfolio of approximately 10 million as of december 29 2012 an increase of approximately 20 million as of december 31 2011 the fluctuations in fair value of our investment portfolio and indebtedness reflect only the direct impact of the change in interest rates other economic variables such as equity market fluctuations and changes in relative credit risk could result in a significantly higher decline in the fair value of our net investment position for further information on how credit risk is factored into the valuation of our investment portfolio and debt issuances see “note 4 fair value” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

equity prices 

our investments include marketable equity securities and equity derivative instruments such as warrants and options we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our equity market exposure through hedging activities however for our investments in strategic equity derivative instruments we may enter into transactions to reduce or eliminate the equity market risks additionally for our securities that we no longer consider strategic we evaluate legal market and economic factors in our decision on the timing of disposal and whether it is possible and appropriate to hedge the equity market risk 

we hold derivative instruments that seek to offset changes in liabilities related to the equity market risks of certain deferred compensation arrangements the gains and losses from changes in fair value of these derivatives are designed to offset the losses and gains on the related liabilities resulting in an insignificant net exposure to loss 

 

  

as of december 29 2012 the fair value of our marketable equity investments and our equity derivative instruments including hedging positions was 44 billion 585 million as of december 31 2011 our marketable equity investment in asml was carried at a total fair market value of 40 billion or 90 of our marketable equity portfolio as of december 29 2012 our marketable equity method investments are excluded from our analysis as the carrying value does not fluctuate based on market price changes unless an otherthantemporary impairment is deemed necessary to determine reasonably possible decreases in the market value of our marketable equity investments we have analyzed the expected market price sensitivity of our marketable equity investment portfolio assuming a loss of 35 in market prices and after reflecting the impact of hedges and offsetting positions the aggregate value of our marketable equity investments could decrease by approximately 16 billion based on the value as of december 29 2012 a decrease in value of approximately 265 million based on the value as of december 31 2011 using an assumed loss of 45 

many of the same factors that could result in an adverse movement of equity market prices affect our nonmarketable equity investments although we cannot always quantify the impact directly financial markets are volatile which could negatively affect the prospects of the companies we invest in their ability to raise additional capital and the likelihood of our ability to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings mergers and private sales these types of investments involve a great deal of risk and there can be no assurance that any specific company will grow or become successful consequently we could lose all or part of our investment our nonmarketable equity investments excluding investments accounted for under the equity method had a carrying amount of 12 billion as of december 29 2012 11 billion as of december 31 2011 as of december 29 2012 the carrying amount of our nonmarketable equity method investments was 10 billion 16 billion as of december 31 2011 the majority of the total nonmarketable equity method investments balance as of december 29 2012 was concentrated in our imft investment of 642 million 13 billion in imft and im flash singapore llp as of december 31 2011

 products 

platforms 

we offer platforms that incorporate various components and technologies including a microprocessor and chipset and may be enhanced by additional hardware software and services 

a microprocessor—the central processing unit cpu of a computer system—processes system data and controls other devices in the system we offer microprocessors with one or multiple processor cores multicore microprocessors can enable improved multitasking and energyefficient performance by distributing computing tasks across two or more cores our 2nd and 3rd generation intel ® core™ processor families integrate graphics functionality onto the processor die in contrast some of our previousgeneration processors incorporated a separate graphics chip inside the processor package we also offer graphics functionality as part of a separate chipset outside the processor package processor packages may also integrate the memory controller 

a chipset sends data between the microprocessor and input display and storage devices such as the keyboard mouse monitor hard drive or solidstate drive and cd dvd or 

bluray drive chipsets extend the audio video and other capabilities of many systems and perform essential logic functions such as balancing the performance of the system and removing bottlenecks some chipsets may also include graphics functionality or a memory controller for use with our microprocessors that do not integrate those system components 

we offer and are continuing to develop systemonchip soc products that integrate our core processing functions with other system components such as graphics audio and video onto a single chip soc products are designed to reduce total cost of ownership provide improved performance due to higher integration and lower power consumption and enable smaller form factors 

we also offer features to improve our platform capabilities for example we offer intel ® vpro ™ technology a computer hardwarebased security technology for the notebook and desktop market segments designed to provide businesses with increased manageability upgradeability energyefficient performance and security while lowering the total cost of ownership in 2011 we introduced the 2nd generation intel ® core ™ vpro™ processor family designed to deliver security manageability and power management on the 32nanometer nm process technology

 competition 

over the past few years the number and variety of computing devices have expanded rapidly creating a connected computing landscape that extends from the largest supercomputers and data centers to the smallest mobile and embedded devices there are frequent product introductions and these products are becoming increasingly capable the competitive environment in the computing industry is in a constant state of flux as customers and collaborators in one part of our business can quickly become competitors in another new market segments can emerge rapidly we are focused on our strategy to expand into market segments beyond our traditional pc and server businesses—including consumer electronics devices embedded applications smartphones and tablets—where we face several incumbent suppliers 

one of our important competitive advantages is the combination of our network of manufacturing and assembly and test facilities with our global architecture design teams this network enables us to have more direct control over our processes quality control product cost production timing performance and other factors most of our competitors rely on thirdparty foundries and subcontractors such as taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company ltd or globalfoundries inc for their manufacturing and assembly and test needs 

our process technology leadership allows us to shrink the size of our transistors optimizing power and performance characteristics and improving our ability to add more transistors and features this leads to more powerful energyefficient microprocessors we believe that as the need for computing power in smartphones and tablets grows our ability to add transistors will become an important competitive advantage for our offerings in those market segments 

our platforms primarily compete based on performance energy efficiency innovative design and features price quality and reliability brand recognition and availability other important competitive factors include development of 

the software ecosystem security connectivity and compatibility with other devices in the computing continuum the ability of our architecture to support multiple operating systems including legacy environments based on x86 is an advantage in offering oem customers operating system choices we believe that our platform strategy to integrate multiple hardware and software technologies gives us a significant competitive advantage 

for many years advanced micro devices inc amd has been our primary competitor in the market segments for platforms used in notebooks and desktops amd also competes with us in the server market segment along with international business machines corporation ibm and oracle corporation companies offering arm limited arm based designs are also attempting to expand into the notebook desktop and server market segments in addition our platforms with integrated graphics and chipsets compete with nvidia corporation’s graphics processors nvidia has shifted some of the workload traditionally performed by the microprocessor to its graphics processor 

companies using arm or mips technologies inc mips based designs are our primary competitors in the consumer electronics devices and embedded applications market segments in smartphones and tablets we face established competitors such as qualcomm incorporated nvidia and texas instruments incorporated which deliver soc solutions based on the arm architecture and complementary wireless technologies as well as companies that incorporate soc solutions that they manufacture the primary competitor for mcafee’s family of security products and services is symantec corporation 

manufacturing and assembly and test 

as of december 31 2011 78 of our wafer fabrication including microprocessors and chipsets was conducted within the us at our facilities in arizona new mexico oregon and massachusetts the remaining 22 of our wafer fabrication was conducted outside the us at our facilities in ireland china and israel 

 

 

as of december 31 2011 we primarily manufactured our products in wafer fabrication facilities at the following locations 

 

   

 as of december 31 2011 a substantial majority of our microprocessors were manufactured on 300millimeter mm wafers using our 32nm process technology in the second half of 2011 we began manufacturing microprocessors using our 22nm process technology as we move to each succeeding generation of manufacturing process technology we incur significant startup costs to prepare each factory for manufacturing however continuing to advance our process technology provides benefits that we believe justify these costs the benefits of moving to each succeeding generation of manufacturing process technology can include using less space per transistor reducing heat output from each transistor and increasing the number of integrated features on each chip these advancements can result in microprocessors that are higher performing consume less power and cost less to manufacture in addition with each shift to a new process technology we are able to produce more microprocessors per square foot of our wafer fabrication facilities the costs to develop our process technology are significantly less than adding capacity by building additional wafer fabrication facilities using older process technology 

we use thirdparty manufacturing companies foundries to manufacture wafers for certain components including networking and communications products in addition we primarily use subcontractors to manufacture boardlevel products and systems and purchase certain communications networking products and mobile phone components from external vendors primarily in the asiapacific region 

following the manufacturing process the majority of our components are subject to assembly and test we perform our components assembly and test at facilities in malaysia china costa rica and vietnam to augment capacity we use subcontractors to perform assembly of certain products primarily chipsets and networking and communications products in addition we use subcontractors to perform assembly and test of our mobile phone components 

our nand flash memory products are manufactured by imft and imfs using 20nm 25nm 34nm or 50nm process technology and assembly and test of these products is performed by micron technology inc and other external subcontractors for further information see “note 11 equity method and cost method investments” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

our employment practices are consistent with and we expect our suppliers and subcontractors to abide by local country law in addition we impose a minimum employee age requirement as well as progressive environmental health and safety ehs requirements regardless of local law 

we have thousands of suppliers including subcontractors providing our various materials and service needs we set expectations for supplier performance and reinforce those expectations with periodic assessments we communicate those expectations to our suppliers regularly and work with them to implement improvements when necessary we seek where possible to have several sources of supply for all of these materials and resources but we may rely on a single or limited number of suppliers or upon suppliers in a single country in those cases we develop and implement plans and actions to reduce the exposure that would result from a disruption in supply we have entered into longterm contracts with certain suppliers to ensure a portion of our silicon supply 

our products are typically produced at multiple intel facilities at various sites around the world or by subcontractors that have multiple facilities however some products are produced in only one intel or subcontractor facility and we seek to implement action plans to reduce the exposure that would result from a disruption at any such facility see “risk factors” in part i item 1a of this form 10k 

research and development 

we are committed to investing in worldclass technology development particularly in the design and manufacture of integrated circuits research and development rd expenditures were 84 billion in 2011 66 billion in 2010 and 57 billion in 2009 

our rd activities are directed toward developing the technology innovations such as threedimensional trigate and hik metal gate transistor technologies that we believe will deliver our next generation of products which will in turn enable new form factors and usage models for businesses and consumers our rd activities range from designing and developing new products and manufacturing processes to researching future technologies and products 

we are focusing our rd efforts on advanced computing technologies developing new microarchitectures advancing our silicon manufacturing process technology delivering the next generation of microprocessors and chipsets improving our platform initiatives and developing software solutions and tools to support our technologies our rd efforts enable new levels of performance and address areas such as energy efficiency security scalability for multicore architectures system manageability and ease of use we continue to make significant rd investments in the development of socs to enable growth in areas such as smartphones tablets and embedded applications in addition we continue to make significant investments in wireless technologies graphics and highperformance computing 

 

  

  

as part of our rd efforts we plan to introduce a new microarchitecture for our notebook ultrabook system desktop and intel xeon processors approximately every two years and ramp the next generation of silicon process technology in the intervening years we refer to this as our “ticktock” technology development cadence in 2011 we started manufacturing products formerly code named ivy bridge using our new 22nm threedimensional trigate transistor process technology 22nm process technology this technology is the first to use a threedimensional transistor design which is expected to improve performance 

and energy efficiency compared to the existing twodimensional transistor structure and significantly decreases the power targets for notebook processors we expect to begin manufacturing products using a new microarchitecture using our 22nm process technology in 2012 we are currently developing 14nm process technology our nextgeneration process technology and expect to begin manufacturing products using that technology in 2013 our leadership in silicon technology has enabled us to make “moore’s law” a reality moore’s law predicted that transistor density on integrated circuits would double about every two years 

 

 

  

our leadership in silicon technology has also helped expand on the advances anticipated by moore’s law by bringing new capabilities into silicon and producing new products optimized for a wider variety of applications we have accelerated the intel atom processorbased soc roadmap for netbooks smartphones tablets and other devices from 32nm through 22nm to 14nm within three successive years intel atom processors will eventually be on the same process technology as our leadingedge products we expect that this acceleration will result in a significant reduction in transistor leakage lower active power and an increase in transistor density to enable more powerful smartphones tablets and netbooks with more features and longer battery life 

our rd model is based on a global organization that emphasizes a collaborative approach to identifying and developing new technologies leading standards initiatives and influencing regulatory policies to accelerate the adoption of new technologies including joint pathfinding conducted between researchers at intel labs and our business groups we centrally manage key crossbusiness group product initiatives to align and prioritize our rd activities across these groups in addition we may augment our rd activities by investing in companies or entering into agreements with companies that have similar rd focus areas as well as directly purchasing intellectual property rights ip applicable to our rd initiatives 

employees 

as of december 31 2011 we had 100100 employees worldwide 82500 as of december 25 2010 with approximately 55 of those employees located in the us 55 as of december 25 2010 the majority of the increase in employees was due to employees hired as a result of the acquisitions of mcafee and the wls business of infineon 

sales and marketing 

customers 

we sell our products primarily to oems and odms odms provide design andor manufacturing services to branded and unbranded privatelabel resellers in addition we sell our products to other manufacturers including makers of a wide range of industrial and communications equipment our customers also include those who buy pc components and our other products through distributor reseller retail and oem channels throughout the world 

our worldwide reseller sales channel consists of thousands of indirect customers—systems builders that purchase intel microprocessors and other products from our distributors we have a boxed processor program that allows distributors to sell intel microprocessors in small quantities to these systemsbuilder customers boxed processors are also available in direct retail outlets 

 

  

 in 2011 hewlettpackard company accounted for 19 of our net revenue 21 in 2010 and 2009 and dell inc accounted for 15 of our net revenue 17 in 2010 and 2009 no other customer accounted for more than 10 of our net revenue for information about revenue and operating income by operating segment and revenue from unaffiliated customers by geographic regioncountry see “results of operations” in part ii item 7 and “note 30 operating segment and geographic information” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

sales arrangements 

our products are sold through sales offices throughout the world sales of our products are typically made via purchase order acknowledgments that contain standard terms and conditions covering matters such as pricing payment terms and warranties as well as indemnities for issues specific to our products such as patent and copyright indemnities from time to time we may enter into additional agreements with customers covering for example changes from our standard terms and conditions new product development and marketing privatelabel branding and other matters most of our sales are made using electronic and webbased processes that allow the customer to review inventory availability and track the progress of specific goods ordered pricing on particular products may vary based on volumes ordered and other factors we also offer discounts rebates and other incentives to customers to increase acceptance of our products and technology 

our products are typically shipped under terms that transfer title to the customer even in arrangements for which the recognition of revenue and related costs of sales is deferred our standard terms and conditions of sale typically provide that payment is due at a later date generally 30 days after shipment or delivery our credit department sets accounts receivable and shipping limits for individual customers to control credit risk to intel arising from outstanding account balances we assess credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis and from this analysis we establish credit limits and determine whether we will use one or more credit support devices such as a thirdparty guarantee or standby letter of credit or credit insurance credit losses may still be incurred due to bankruptcy fraud or other failure of the customer to pay for information about our allowance for doubtful receivables see “schedule ii—valuation and qualifying accounts” in part iv of this form 10k 

most of our sales to distributors are made under agreements allowing for price protection on unsold merchandise and a right of return on stipulated quantities of unsold merchandise under the price protection program we give distributors credits for the difference between the original price paid and the current price that we offer on most products there is no 

contractual limit on the amount of price protection nor is there a limit on the time horizon under which price protection is granted the right of return granted generally consists of a stock rotation program in which distributors are able to exchange certain products based on the number of qualified purchases made by the distributor we have the option to grant credit for repair or replace defective products and there is no contractual limit on the amount of credit that may be granted to a distributor for defective products 

distribution 

distributors typically handle a wide variety of products including those that compete with our products and fill orders for many customers we also utilize thirdparty sales representatives who generally do not offer directly competitive products but may carry complementary items manufactured by others sales representatives do not maintain a product inventory instead their customers place orders directly with us or through distributors we have several distribution warehouses that are located in close proximity to key customers 

backlog 

over time our larger customers have generally moved to leaninventory or justintime operations rather than maintaining larger inventories of our products we have arrangements with these customers to seek to quickly fill orders from regional warehouses as a result our manufacturing production is based on estimates and advance nonbinding commitments from customers as to future purchases our order backlog as of any particular date is a mix of these commitments and specific firm orders that are made primarily pursuant to standard purchase orders for delivery of products only a small portion of our orders is noncancelable and the dollar amount associated with the noncancelable portion is not significant 

seasonal trends 

our platform sales generally have followed a seasonal trend historically our sales have been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year accelerating in the third quarter and peaking in the fourth quarter consumer and business purchases of pcs have historically been higher in the second half of the year 

 

  

 marketing 

our corporate marketing objectives are to build a strong wellknown intel corporate brand that connects with businesses and consumers and to offer a limited number of meaningful and valuable brands in our portfolio to aid businesses and consumers in making informed choices about technology purchases the intel ® core™ processor family and the intel atom intel ® pentium ®  intel ® celeron ®  intel xeon and intel ® itanium ® trademarks make up our processor brands 

we promote brand awareness and generate demand through our own direct marketing as well as comarketing programs our direct marketing activities include television print and internet advertising as well as press relations consumer and trade events and industry and consumer communications we market to consumer and business audiences and focus on building awareness and generating demand for increased performance improved energy efficiency and other capabilities such as internet connectivity and security 

purchases by customers often allow them to participate in cooperative advertising and marketing programs such as the intel inside ® program this program broadens the reach of our brands beyond the scope of our own direct marketing through the intel inside program certain customers are licensed to place intel logos on computing devices containing our microprocessors and processor technologies and to use our brands in their marketing activities the program includes a market development component that accrues funds based on purchases and partially reimburses the oems for marketing activities for products featuring intel brands subject to the oems meeting defined criteria these marketing activities primarily include television print and internet marketing we have also entered into joint marketing arrangements with certain customers 

intellectual property rights and licensing 

ip that applies to our products and services includes patents copyrights trade secrets trademarks and maskwork rights we maintain a program to protect our investment in technology by attempting to ensure respect for our ip the extent of the legal protection given to different types of ip varies under different countries’ legal systems we intend to license our ip where we can obtain adequate consideration see “competition” earlier in this section “risk factors” in part i item 1a and “note 29 contingencies” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

we have obtained patents in the us and other countries while our patents are an important element of our success our business as a whole is not significantly dependent on any one patent because of the fast pace of innovation and 

product development and the comparative pace of governments’ patenting processes our products are often obsolete before the patents related to them expire and may sometimes be obsolete before the patents related to them are even granted as we expand our products into new industries we also seek to extend our patent development efforts to patent such products established competitors in existing and new industries as well as companies that purchase and enforce patents and other ip may already have patents covering similar products there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain patents covering our own products or that we will be able to obtain licenses from other companies on favorable terms or at all 

the software that we distribute including software embedded in our componentlevel and systemlevel products is entitled to copyright protection to distinguish intel products from our competitors’ products we have obtained trademarks and trade names for our products and we maintain cooperative advertising programs with customers to promote our brands and to identify products containing genuine intel components we also protect details about our processes products and strategies as trade secrets keeping confidential the information that we believe provides us with a competitive advantage 

in the first quarter of 2011 we entered into a longterm patent crosslicense agreement with nvidia under the agreement we received a license to all of nvidia’s patents with a capture period that runs through march 2017 while nvidia products are licensed to our patents subject to exclusions for x86 products certain chipsets and certain flash memory technology products 

compliance with environmental health and safety regulations 

our compliance efforts focus on monitoring regulatory and resource trends and setting companywide performance targets for key resources and emissions these targets address several parameters including product design chemical energy and water use waste recycling the source of certain minerals used in our products climate change and emissions 

intel focuses on reducing natural resource use the solid and chemical waste byproducts of our manufacturing processes and the environmental impact of our products we currently use a variety of materials in our manufacturing process that have the potential to adversely impact the environment and are subject to a variety of ehs laws and regulations over the past several years we have significantly reduced the use of lead and halogenated flame retardants in our products and manufacturing processes 

 

  

 we work with the us environmental protection agency epa nongovernmental organizations oems and retailers to help manage ewaste which includes electronic products nearing the end of their useful lives and promote recycling the european union requires producers of certain electrical and electronic equipment to develop programs that allow consumers to return products for recycling many states in the us have similar ewaste takeback laws although these laws are typically targeted at the end electronic product and not the component products that intel manufactures the inconsistency of many ewaste takeback laws and the lack of local ewaste management options in many areas pose a challenge for our compliance efforts 

intel is an industry leader in efforts to build ethical sourcing of minerals for our products intel has partnered with the us state department and the us agency for international development to create pilot programs that would allow for tracking and tracing of our source materials in particular those minerals sourced from the democratic republic of the congo in 2012 intel will continue to work to establish a conflictfree supply chain for our company and our industry intel’s goal for 2012 is to verify that the tantalum we use in our microprocessors is conflictfree and our goal for 2013 is to manufacture the world’s first verified conflictfree microprocessor 

intel seeks to reduce our global greenhouse gas emissions by investing in energy conservation projects in our factories and working with suppliers to improve energy efficiency we take a holistic approach to power management addressing the challenge at the silicon package circuit micromacro architecture platform and software levels we recognize that climate change may cause general economic risk for further information on the risks of climate change see “risk factors” in part i item 1a of this form 10k we see the potential for higher energy costs driven by climate change regulations this could include items applied to utilities that are passed along to customers such as carbon taxes or costs associated with obtaining permits for our us manufacturing operations emission cap and trade programs or renewable portfolio standards 

we are committed to sustainability and take a leadership position in promoting voluntary environmental initiatives and working proactively with governments environmental groups and industry to promote global environmental sustainability we believe that technology will be fundamental to finding solutions to the world’s environmental challenges and we are joining forces with industry business and governments to find and promote ways that technology can be used as a tool to combat climate change 

we have been purchasing wind power and other forms of renewable energy at some of our major sites for several years we purchase renewable energy certificates under a multiyear contract the purchase has placed intel at the top of the epa’s green power partnership for the past four years and was intended to help stimulate the market for green power leading to additional generating capacity and ultimately lower costs 

distribution of company information 

our internet address is wwwintelcom  we publish voluntary reports on our web site that outline our performance with respect to corporate responsibility including ehs compliance 

we use our investor relations web site wwwintccom as a routine channel for distribution of important information including news releases analyst presentations and financial information we post filings as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the us securities and exchange commission sec including our annual and quarterly reports on forms 10k and 10q and current reports on form 8k our proxy statements and any amendments to those reports or statements all such postings and filings are available on our investor relations web site free of charge in addition our investor relations web site allows interested persons to sign up to automatically receive email alerts when we post news releases and financial information the sec’s web site wwwsecgov contains reports proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the sec the content on any web site referred to in this form 10k is not incorporated by reference in this form 10k unless expressly noted

 item 1a risk factors tableend changes in product demand may harm our financial results and are hard to predict 

if product demand decreases our revenue and profit could be harmed important factors that could cause demand for our products to decrease include changes in 

       our operations have high costs such as those related to facility construction and equipment rd and employment and training of a highly skilled workforce that are either fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term at the same time demand for our products is highly variable if product demand decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately we could be required to write off inventory or record excess capacity charges which would lower our gross margin our manufacturing or assembly and test capacity could be underutilized and we may be required to write down our longlived assets which would increase our expenses factoryplanning decisions may shorten the useful lives of facilities and equipment and cause us to accelerate depreciation if product demand increases we may be unable to add capacity fast enough to meet market demand these changes in product demand and changes in our customers’ product needs could negatively affect our competitive position and may reduce our revenue increase our costs lower our gross margin percentage or require us to write down our assets 

we operate in highly competitive industries and our failure to anticipate and respond to technological and market developments could harm our ability to compete 

we operate in highly competitive industries that experience rapid technological and market developments changes in industry standards changes in customer needs and frequent product introductions and improvements if we are unable to anticipate and respond to these developments we may weaken our competitive position and our products or technologies may be uncompetitive or obsolete as computing market segments emerge such as netbooks smartphones tablets and consumer electronics devices we face new sources of competition and customers with different needs than customers in our pc business to be successful we need to cultivate new industry relationships in these market segments as the number and variety of 

internetconnected devices increase we need to improve the cost connectivity energy efficiency and security of our platforms to succeed in these new market segments and we need to expand our software capabilities in order to provide customers with complete computing solutions 

to compete successfully we must maintain a successful rd effort develop new products and production processes and improve our existing products and processes ahead of competitors our rd efforts are critical to our success and are aimed at solving complex problems and we do not expect that all of our projects will be successful we may be unable to develop and market new products successfully the products we invest in and develop may not be well received by customers and products and technologies offered by others may affect demand for our products these types of events could negatively affect our competitive position and may reduce revenue increase costs lower gross margin percentage or require us to impair our assets 

changes in the mix of products sold may harm our financial results 

because of the wide price differences in notebook netbook smartphone tablet desktop and server microprocessors the mix of microprocessors sold affects the average selling prices of our products and has a large impact on our revenue and gross margin our financial results also depend on the mix of other products that we sell such as chipsets flash memory and other semiconductor products more recently introduced products tend to have higher costs because of initial development and production and changes in the mix of products sold may affect our ability to recover our fixed costs and product investments 

our global operations subject us to risks that may harm our results of operations and financial condition 

we have sales offices rd manufacturing assembly and test facilities and other facilities in many countries and some business activities may be concentrated in one or more geographic areas as a result our ability to manufacture assemble and test design develop or sell products may be affected by 

     

 

  

 legal and regulatory requirements differ among jurisdictions worldwide violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation although we have policies controls and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws our employees contractors or agents may violate our policies 

although most of our sales occur in us dollars expenses such as payroll utilities tax and marketing expenses may be paid in local currencies we also conduct certain investing and financing activities in local currencies our hedging programs reduce but do not eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements therefore changes in exchange rates could harm our results and financial condition changes in tariff and import regulations and in us and nonus monetary policies may harm our results and financial condition by increasing our expenses and reducing revenue varying tax rates in different jurisdictions could harm our results of operations and financial condition by increasing our overall tax rate 

we maintain a program of insurance coverage for a variety of property casualty and other risks we place our insurance coverage with multiple carriers in numerous jurisdictions however one or more of our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim the types and amounts of insurance we obtain vary depending on availability cost and decisions with respect to risk retention the policies have deductibles and exclusions that result in us retaining a level of selfinsurance losses not covered by insurance may be large which could harm our results of operations and financial condition 

failure to meet our production targets resulting in undersupply or oversupply of products may harm our business and results of operations 

production of integrated circuits is a complex process disruptions in this process can result from errors difficulties in our development and implementation of new processes defects in materials disruptions in our supply of materials or resources and disruptions at our fabrication and assembly and test facilities due to accidents maintenance issues or unsafe working conditions—all of which could affect the timing of production ramps and yields we may not be successful or efficient in developing or implementing new production processes production issues may result in our failure to meet or increase production as desired resulting in higher costs or large decreases in yields which could affect our ability to produce sufficient volume to meet product demand the unavailability or reduced availability of products could make it more difficult to deliver computing platforms the occurrence of these events could harm our business and results of operations 

we may have difficulties obtaining the resources or products we need for manufacturing assembling and testing our products or operating other aspects of our business which could harm our ability to meet demand and increase our costs 

we have thousands of suppliers providing materials that we use in production and other aspects of our business and we seek where possible to have several sources of supply for all of those materials however we may rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers or upon suppliers in a single location for these materials the inability of suppliers to deliver adequate supplies of production materials or other supplies could disrupt our production processes or make it more difficult for us to implement our business strategy production could be disrupted by the unavailability of resources used in production such as water silicon electricity gases and other materials future environmental regulations could restrict the supply or increase the cost of materials that we use in our business and make it more difficult to obtain permits to build or modify manufacturing capacity to meet demand the unavailability or reduced availability of materials or resources may require us to reduce production or incur additional costs the occurrence of these events could harm our business and results of operations 

costs related to product defects and errata may harm our results of operations and business 

costs of product defects and errata deviations from published specifications due to for example problems in our design and manufacturing processes could include 

     these costs could be large and may increase expenses and lower gross margin our reputation with customers or end users could be damaged as a result of product defects and errata and product demand could be reduced the announcement of product defects and errata could cause customers to purchase products from competitors as a result of possible shortages of intel components or for other reasons these factors could harm our business and financial results 

 

  

 third parties may attempt to breach our network security which could damage our reputation and financial results 

we regularly face attempts by others to gain unauthorized access through the internet or introduce malicious software to our it systems these attempts—which might be the result of industrial or other espionage or actions by hackers seeking to harm the company its products or end users—are sometimes successful in part because of the high profile of our mcafee subsidiary in the network and system protection business we might become a target of computer hackers who create viruses to sabotage or otherwise attack our products and services hackers might attempt to penetrate our network security and gain access to our network and our data centers steal proprietary information including personally identifiable information or interrupt our internal systems and services we seek to detect and investigate these security incidents and to prevent their recurrence but in some cases we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects 

third parties may claim infringement of ip which could harm our business 

we may face ip infringement claims from individuals and companies including those who have acquired patent portfolios to assert claims against other companies we are engaged in a number of litigation matters involving ip claims that our products or processes infringe the ip of others could cause us to incur large costs to respond to defend and resolve the claims and may divert the efforts and attention of management and technical personnel as a result of ip infringement claims we could 

    these actions could harm our competitive position result in expenses or require us to impair our assets if we alter or stop production of affected items our revenue could be harmed 

we may be unable to enforce or protect our ip which may harm our ability to compete and harm our business 

our ability to enforce our patents copyrights software licenses and other ip is subject to general litigation risks as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our ip in various countries when we seek to enforce our rights we are often subject to claims that the ip is invalid not enforceable or licensed to the opposing party our assertion of ip often results in the other party seeking to assert claims against us 

which could harm our business governments may adopt regulations—and governments or courts may render decisions—requiring compulsory licensing of ip or governments may require products to meet standards that serve to favor local companies our inability to enforce our ip under these circumstances may harm our competitive position and business 

we may be subject to ip theft or misuse which could result in claims and harm our business and results of operations 

the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products the value of our investment in rd product development and marketing could be reduced and third parties might make claims related to losses of confidential or proprietary information or enduser data or system reliability these incidents and claims could severely disrupt our business and we could suffer losses including the cost of product recalls and returns and reputational harm 

our licenses with other companies and participation in industry initiatives may allow competitors to use our patent rights 

companies in the computing industry often bilaterally license patents between each other to settle disputes or as part of business agreements between them our competitors may have licenses to our patents and under current case law some of the licenses may permit these competitors to pass our patent rights on to others under some circumstances our participation in industry standards organizations or with other industry initiatives may require us to license our patents to companies that adopt industrystandard specifications depending on the rules of the organization we might have to grant these licenses to our patents for little or no cost and as a result we may be unable to enforce certain patents against others our costs of enforcing our licenses or protecting our patents may increase and the value of our ip may be impaired 

litigation or regulatory proceedings could harm our business 

we may face legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder consumer competition and other issues on a global basis as described in “note 29 contingencies” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k we are engaged in a number of litigation and regulatory matters litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain and adverse rulings could occur including monetary damages or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling products engaging in business practices or requiring other remedies such as compulsory licensing of patents 

 

  

 we face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties 

we sell a portion of our products through third parties such as distributors valueadded resellers oems internet service providers and channel partners collectively referred to as distributors using third parties for distribution exposes us to many risks including competitive pressure concentration credit risk and compliance risks distributors may sell products that compete with our products and we may need to provide financial and other incentives to focus distributors on the sale of our products we may rely on one or more key distributors for a product and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue distributors may face financial difficulties including bankruptcy which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and financial results violations of fcpa or similar laws by distributors or other thirdparty intermediaries could have a material impact on our business failing to manage risks related to our use of distributors may reduce sales increase expenses and weaken our competitive position 

we face risks related to sales to government entities 

we derive a portion of our revenue from sales to government entities and their respective agencies government demand and payment for our products may be affected by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations government contracts are subject to oversight including special rules on accounting expenses reviews and security failing to comply with these rules could result in civil and criminal penalties and sanctions including termination of contracts fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business 

we invest in companies for strategic reasons and may not realize a return on our investments 

we make investments in companies around the world to further strategic objectives and support key business initiatives these investments include equity or debt instruments of public or private companies and many of these instruments are nonmarketable at the time of our initial investment companies range from earlystage companies that are still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models the companies in which we invest may fail because they may be unable to secure additional funding obtain favorable terms for future financings or participate in liquidity events such as public offerings mergers and private sales if any of these private companies fail we could lose all or part of our investment if we determine that an otherthantemporary decline in the fair value exists for an investment we write down the investment to its fair value and recognize a loss we have large investments in the flash memory market segment and declines in this market segment or changes in management’s plans with respect to our investments in this market segment could result in large impairment charges impacting gains losses on equity investments net 

when the strategic objectives of an investment have been achieved or if the investment or business diverges from our strategic objectives we may decide to dispose of the investment we may incur losses on the disposal of nonmarketable investments for cases in which we are required under equity method accounting to recognize a proportionate share of another company’s income or loss such income or loss may impact earnings gains or losses from equity securities could vary from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of securities gains or losses from equity investments and impairment charges for equity and other investments 

our results of operations could vary as a result of the methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying accounting policies 

the methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying accounting policies have a large impact on our results of operations for further information see “critical accounting estimates” in part ii item 7 of this form 10k these methods estimates and judgments are subject to large risks uncertainties and assumptions and changes could affect our results of operations 

changes in our effective tax rate may harm our results of operations 

a number of factors may increase our effective tax rates which could reduce our net income including 

        

 

  

 decisions about the scope of operations of our business could affect our results of operations and financial condition 

changes in the business environment could lead to changes in the scope of our operations resulting in restructuring and asset impairment charges factors that could affect our results of operations and financial condition due to a change in the scope of our operations include 

       our acquisitions divestitures and other transactions could disrupt our ongoing business and harm our results of operations 

in pursuing our business strategy we routinely conduct discussions evaluate opportunities and enter into agreements for possible investments acquisitions divestitures and other transactions such as joint ventures acquisitions and other transactions involve large challenges and risks including risks that 

       

when we decide to sell assets or a business we may have difficulty selling on acceptable terms in a timely manner and the agreed terms and financing arrangements could be renegotiated due to changes in business or market conditions these circumstances could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives or cause us to incur added expense or we may sell a business at a price or on terms that are less favorable than we had anticipated resulting in a loss on the transaction 

if we do enter into agreements with respect to acquisitions divestitures or other transactions we may fail to complete them due to factors such as 

   our failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could harm our business and results of operations 

the manufacturing and assembling and testing of our products require the use of hazardous materials that are subject to a broad array of ehs laws and regulations our failure to comply with these laws or regulations could result in 

    our failure to manage the use transportation emissions discharge storage recycling or disposal of hazardous materials could lead to increased costs or future liabilities environmental laws and regulations could also require us to acquire pollution abatement or remediation equipment modify product designs or incur other expenses many new materials that we are evaluating for use in our operations may be subject to regulation under environmental laws and regulations these restrictions could harm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter manufacturing and assembly and test processes 

 

  

 climate change poses both regulatory and physical risks that could harm our results of operations and affect the way we conduct business 

in addition to the possible direct economic impact that climate change could have on us climate change mitigation programs and regulations can increase our costs the cost of perfluorocompounds pfcs—a gas that we use in manufacturing—could increase under some climatechangefocused emissions trading programs that may be imposed by regulation if the use of pfcs is prohibited we would need to obtain substitute materials that may cost more or be less available for our manufacturing operations airquality permit requirements for our manufacturing operations could become more burdensome and cause delays in our ability to modify or build additional manufacturing capacity under recently adopted greenhouse gas regulations in the us many of our manufacturing facilities have become “major” sources under the clean air act at a minimum this change in status results in some uncertainty as the epa adopts guidance on its greenhouse gas regulations due to the dynamic nature of our operations it is likely that these regulations will result in increased costs for our us operations these cost increases could be associated with new air pollution control requirements and increased or new monitoring recordkeeping and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions 

we also see the potential for higher energy costs driven by climate change regulations our costs could increase if utility companies pass on their costs such as those associated with carbon taxes emission cap and trade programs or renewable portfolio standards while we maintain business recovery plans that are intended to allow us to recover from natural disasters or other events that can be disruptive to our business we cannot be sure that our plans will fully protect us from all such disasters or events many of our operations are located in semiarid regions such as israel and the southwestern us some scenarios predict that these regions may become even more vulnerable to prolonged droughts due to climate change 

a number of factors could lower interest and other net harming our results of operations 

factors that could lower interest and other net in our income statements include changes in fixedincome equity and credit markets foreign currency exchange rates interest rates credit standing of financial instrument counterparties our cash and investment balances and our indebtedness

  the various sections of this mda contain a number of forwardlooking statements words such as “expects” “goals” “plans” “believes” “continues” “may” “will” and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forwardlooking statements in addition any statements that refer to projections of our future financial performance our anticipated growth and trends in our businesses and other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forwardlooking statements such statements are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risk factors described throughout this filing and particularly in “risk factors” in part i item 1a of this form 10k our actual results may differ materially and these forwardlooking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any divestitures mergers acquisitions or other business combinations that had not been completed as of february 23 2012 

 

 

overview 

our results of operations were as follows 

 

   

2011 was our most profitable year with record revenue operating income net income and earnings per share revenue of 540 billion was up 104 billion or 24 from a year ago and was our second year in a row with revenue growing over 20 we saw growth in 2011 in both our client business and our data center business our client business is benefiting as rising incomes increase the affordability of pcs in emerging markets our data center business is benefiting as the increasing number of devices that compute and connect to the internet drives the buildout of the cloud infrastructure additionally we completed the acquisitions of mcafee and the wls business of infineon in 2011 which combined contributed approximately 36 billion to our revenue growth our 2011 gross margin percentage was down 28 percentage points compared to 2010 the decline 

was primarily driven by the increase in startup costs associated with 22nm factories as well as the impact of acquisitions these declines were partially offset by growth in our platform business 

our fourth quarter revenue of 139 billion was down 346 million from the third quarter of 2011 the floods in thailand and the resulting hard disk drive supply shortage negatively impacted our fourth quarter revenue as our customers reduced inventories across the supply chain we expect the shortage of hard disk drives to continue to impact our business in the first quarter of 2012 compared to the third quarter of 2011 our fourth quarter gross margin was up 11 percentage points as a result of lower manufacturing costs platform unit costs and other cost of sales partially offset by higher platform writeoffs 

 

  

 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

  

our strong financial performance during 2011 has allowed us to make significant investments in our business as well as increase the return of cash to our stockholders through common stock repurchases and dividends for 2011 we generated a record 210 billion of cash from operations and ended the quarter with an investment portfolio of 148 billion consisting of cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and marketable debt instruments included in trading assets during 2011 we issued 50 billion of senior unsecured notes primarily to repurchase shares of our common stock repurchased 141 billion of common stock through our common stock repurchase program purchased 108 billion in capital assets spent 87 billion on acquisitions and returned 41 billion to stockholders through dividends in january 2012 the board of directors declared a cash dividend of 021 per common share for the first quarter of 2012 

looking ahead to 2012 we believe that the emerging market the data center and enterprise trends that drove our revenue in 2011 will continue to drive our business in 2012 in addition we have a strong product and technology pipeline coming to market with the ramp of ultrabook systems with the launch of our 22nm process technology microprocessors code named “ivy bridge” the launch of our new server platform code named “romley” security and intel processorpowered smartphones and tablets for 2012 we are also forecasting a gross margin increase of 15 percentage points to 64 we expect lower startup costs no impact from the intel ® 6 series express chipset design issue and higher platform revenue these increases to gross margin are expected to be partially offset by higher platform unit costs as we ramp ivy bridge we are forecasting an increase in our investment in rd of approximately 18 billion as we make incremental investment in technologies for ultrabook systems data centers smartphones and tablets additionally we are making investments in core capabilities such as security socs and extending our process technology leadership we are forecasting an increase in capital spending to 125 billion which is 17 billion higher than in 2011 as we build the world’s first highvolume manufacturing factories for 14nm process technology we believe that this continued investment will allow our process technology and manufacturing advantage to continue to extend in 2012 enabling a leadership product portfolio 

our business outlook for 2012 includes our current expectations for revenue gross margin percentage spending and capital expenditures we will keep our most current business outlook publicly available on our investor relations web site at wwwintccom  this business outlook is not incorporated by reference into this form 10k we expect that our corporate representatives will from time to time meet publicly or privately with investors and others and may reiterate the forwardlooking statements contained in business outlook or in this form 10k the public can 

continue to rely on the business outlook published on the web site as representing our current expectations on matters covered unless we publish a notice stating otherwise the statements in business outlook and forwardlooking statements in this form 10k are subject to revision during the course of the year in our quarterly earnings releases and sec filings and at other times 

the forwardlooking statements in business outlook will be effective through the close of business on march 16 2012 unless updated earlier from the close of business on march 16 2012 until our quarterly earnings release is published presently scheduled for april 17 2012 we will observe a “quiet period” during the quiet period business outlook and other forwardlooking statements first published in our form 8k filed on january 19 2012 and other forwardlooking statements disclosed in the company’s news releases and filings with the sec as reiterated or updated as applicable in this form 10k should be considered historical speaking as of prior to the quiet period only and not subject to update during the quiet period our representatives will not comment on our business outlook or our financial results or expectations the exact timing and duration of the routine quiet period and any others that we utilize from time to time may vary at our discretion 

critical accounting estimates 

the methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our consolidated financial statements some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain our most critical accounting estimates include 

     below we discuss these policies further as well as the estimates and judgments involved 

 

  

 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

  

nonmarketable equity investments 

we regularly invest in nonmarketable equity instruments of private companies which range from earlystage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models the carrying value of our nonmarketable equity investment portfolio excluding equity derivatives totaled 28 billion as of december 31 2011 26 billion as of december 25 2010 approximately half of this balance as of december 31 2011 was concentrated in companies in the flash memory market segment our flash memory market segment investments include our investment in imft and imfs of 13 billion 15 billion as of december 25 2010 for additional information see “note 11 equity method and cost method investments” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

our nonmarketable equity investments are recorded using the cost method or the equity method of accounting depending on the facts and circumstances of each investment our nonmarketable equity investments are classified within other longterm assets on the consolidated balance sheets 

nonmarketable equity investments are inherently risky and their success is dependent on product development market acceptance operational efficiency the ability of the investee companies to raise additional funds in financial markets that can be volatile and other key business factors the companies could fail or not be able to raise additional funds when needed or they may receive lower valuations with less favorable investment terms than previous financings these events could cause our investments to become impaired in addition financial market volatility could negatively affect our ability to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings mergers and private sales for further information about our investment portfolio risks see “risk factors” in part i item 1a of this form 10k 

we determine the fair value of our nonmarketable equity investments portfolio quarterly for disclosure purposes however the investments are recorded at fair value only if an impairment charge is recognized we determine the fair value of our nonmarketable equity investments using the market and income approaches the market approach includes the use of financial metrics and ratios of comparable public companies such as projected revenue earnings and comparable performance multiples the selection of 

comparable companies requires management judgment and is based on a number of factors including comparable companies’ sizes growth rates industries development stages and other relevant factors the income approach includes the use of a discounted cash flow model which may include one or multiple discounted cash flow scenarios and requires the following significant estimates for the investee revenue expenses capital spending and other costs and discount rates based on the risk profile of comparable companies estimates of revenue expenses capital spending and other costs are developed using available market historical and forecast data the valuation of our nonmarketable equity investments also takes into account variables such as conditions reflected in the capital markets recent financing activities by the investees the investees’ capital structures the terms of the investees’ issued interests and the lack of marketability of the investments 

for nonmarketable equity investments the measurement of fair value requires significant judgment and includes quantitative and qualitative analysis of identified events or circumstances that impact the fair value of the investment such as 

     if the fair value of an investment is below our carrying value we determine if the investment is otherthantemporarily impaired based on our quantitative and qualitative analysis which includes assessing the severity and duration of the impairment and the likelihood of recovery before disposal if the investment is considered to be otherthantemporarily impaired we write down the investment to its fair value impairments of nonmarketable equity investments were 63 million in 2011 over the past 12 quarters including the fourth quarter of 2011 impairments of nonmarketable equity investments ranged from 8 million to 79 million per quarter 

 

  

 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

  

longlived assets 

property plant and equipment 

we assess property plant and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant underperformance of a business or product line in relation to expectations significant negative industry or economic trends and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets we measure the recoverability of assets that will continue to be used in our operations by comparing the carrying value of the asset grouping to our estimate of the related total future undiscounted net cash flows if an asset grouping’s carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows the asset grouping is considered to be impaired the impairment is measured by comparing the difference between the asset grouping’s carrying value and its fair value property plant and equipment is considered a nonfinancial asset and is recorded at fair value only if an impairment charge is recognized 

impairments are determined for groups of assets related to the lowest level of identifiable independent cash flows due to our asset usage model and the interchangeable nature of our semiconductor manufacturing capacity we must make subjective judgments in determining the independent cash flows that can be related to specific asset groupings in addition as we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions we must make subjective judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets primarily processspecific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements when we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated we accelerate the rate of depreciation over the assets’ new shorter useful lives over the past 12 quarters including the fourth quarter of 2011 impairments and accelerated depreciation of property plant and equipment ranged from 10 million to 75 million per quarter 

goodwill 

goodwill is recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired goodwill is allocated to our reporting units based on relative fair value of the future benefit of the purchased operations to our existing business units as well as the acquired business unit reporting units may be operating segments as a whole or an operation one level below an operating segment referred to as a component our reporting units are consistent with the operating segments identified in “note 30 operating segment and geographic information” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

we perform an annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit in which goodwill resides is less than its carrying value for reporting units in which this assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than its carrying value goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test qualitative factors considered in this assessment include industry and market considerations overall financial performance and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit 

for reporting units in which the impairment assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying value we perform the first step of the goodwill impairment test which compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform further testing if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit then we must perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill if during this second step we determine that the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference 

determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions our goodwill impairment test uses a weighting of both the income and market methods to estimate the reporting unit’s fair value the income method is based on a discounted future cash flow approach that uses the following reporting unit estimates revenue based on assumed market segment growth rates and intel’s assumed market segment share estimated costs and appropriate discount rates based on the reporting units’ weighted average cost of capital as determined by considering the observable weighted average cost of capital of comparable companies our estimates of market segment growth our market segment share and costs are based on historical data various internal estimates and a variety of external sources and are developed as part of our routine longrange planning process the same estimates are also used in planning for our longterm manufacturing and assembly and test capacity needs as part of our capital budgeting process and for both longterm and shortterm business planning and forecasting we test the reasonableness of the inputs and outcomes of our discounted cash flow analysis against available comparable market data the market method is based on financial multiples of comparable companies and applies a control premium the reporting unit’s carrying value represents the assignment of various assets and liabilities excluding certain corporate assets and liabilities such as cash investments and debt 

 

  

 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

  

during the fourth quarter of each of the prior three fiscal years we completed our annual impairment assessments and impairment tests when necessary and concluded that goodwill was not impaired in any of these years

we make judgments about the recoverability of purchased finitelived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist recoverability of finitelived intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate we review indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment quarterly and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable recoverability of indefinitelived intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future discounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate if it is determined that an individual asset is impaired the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset 

the assumptions and estimates used to determine future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible and other longlived assets are complex and subjective they can be affected by various factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our forecasts for specific product lines based on our impairment reviews of our intangible assets we recognized impairment charges of approximately 10 million in 2011 and no impairment charges in the prior two fiscal years 

income taxes 

we must make estimates and judgments in determining the provision for taxes for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes as well as the interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions significant changes in these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 

we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets if recovery is not likely we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable we believe that we will ultimately recover the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets however should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets our 

tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely recovery of a portion of our deferred tax assets is impacted by management’s plans with respect to holding or disposing of certain investments therefore changes in management’s plans with respect to holding or disposing of investments could affect our future provision for taxes 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a twostep process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any if we determine that a tax position will more likely than not be sustained on audit the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors such as changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law new audit activity and effectively settled issues determining whether an uncertain tax position is effectively settled requires judgment such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 

inventory 

the valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality the determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products the estimate of future demand is compared to workinprocess and finished goods inventory levels to determine the amount if any of obsolete or excess inventory as of december 31 2011 we had total workinprocess inventory of 17 billion and total finished goods inventory of 18 billion the demand forecast is included in the development of our shortterm manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuation and build decisions productspecific facts and circumstances reviewed in the inventory valuation process include a review of the customer base the stage of the product life cycle of our products consumer confidence and customer acceptance of our products as well as an assessment of the selling price in relation to the product cost if our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly we could be required to write off inventory which would negatively impact our gross margin 

 

  

 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

  

in order to determine what costs can be included in the valuation of inventory we must determine normal capacity at our manufacturing and assembly and test facilities based on historical loadings compared to total available capacity if the factory loadings are below the established normal capacity level a portion of our manufacturing overhead costs would not be included in the cost of inventory and therefore would be recognized as cost of sales in that period which would negatively impact our gross margin we refer to these costs as excess capacity charges over the past 12 quarters excess capacity charges ranged from zero to 680 million per quarter 

loss contingencies 

we are subject to various legal and administrative proceedings and asserted and potential claims accruals related to repair or replacement of parts in connection with product errata as well as product warranties and potential asset impairments loss contingencies that arise in the ordinary course of business an estimated loss from such contingencies is recognized as a charge to income if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated disclosure of a loss contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred the outcomes of 

legal and administrative proceedings and claims and the estimation of product warranties and asset impairments are subject to significant uncertainty significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether a loss is reasonably estimable with respect to estimating the losses associated with repairing and replacing parts in connection with product errata we make judgments with respect to customer return rates costs to repair or replace parts and where the product is in our customer’s manufacturing process at least quarterly we review the status of each significant matter and we may revise our estimates these revisions could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position

results of operations 

the following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of income data as a percentage of net revenue for the periods indicated 

 

 geographic breakdown of revenue 

 

  

our net revenue for 2011 which included 53 weeks increased 104 billion or 24 compared to 2010 which included 52 weeks the increase was due to significantly higher platform microprocessor and chipset average selling prices and to a lesser extent slightly higher platform unit sales revenue from intel mobile communications formerly the wls business of infineon and mcafee contributed 36 billion to 2011 revenue revenue in the americas europe asiapacific and japan regions increased by 31 24 23 and 13 respectively compared to 2010 

  

our overall gross margin dollars for 2011 increased 53 billion or 18 compared to 2010 the increase was primarily due to significantly higher revenue from our existing business as well as our acquired business the increase was partially offset by approximately 10 billion of higher startup costs compared to 2010 the amortization of acquisitionrelated intangibles resulted in a 482 million reduction to our overall gross margin dollars in 2011 compared to 65 million in 2010 primarily due to the acquisitions of mcafee and the wls business of infineon 

 

  

 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

  

our overall gross margin percentage decreased to 625 in 2011 from 653 in 2010 the decrease in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to the gross margin percentage decrease in the pc client group and to a lesser extent the gross margin percentage decrease in the other intel architecture operating segments we derived a substantial majority of our overall gross margin dollars in 2011 and most of our overall gross margin dollars in 2010 from the sale of platforms in the pc client group and data center group operating segments 

our net revenue for 2010 increased 85 billion or 24 compared to 2009 the increase was due to significantly higher platform unit sales and to a lesser extent higher platform average selling prices revenue in the japan asiapacific americas and europe regions increased by 31 29 21 and 6 respectively compared to 2009 

our overall gross margin dollars for 2010 increased 89 billion or 46 compared to 2009 the increase was primarily due to significantly higher revenue to a lesser extent excess capacity charges recorded in 2009 of 11 billion and lower platform unit costs contributed to the increase in gross margin dollars for 2010 compared to 2009 these increases were partially offset by charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2010 to repair and replace materials and systems impacted by a design issue related to our intel ® 6 series express chipset family for further information see “note 20 chipset design issue” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

our overall gross margin percentage increased to 653 in 2010 from 557 in 2009 the increase in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to the gross margin percentage increase in the pc client group operating segment and to a lesser extent gross margin percentage increases in the data center group the other intel architecture operating segments and the nonvolatile memory solutions group we derived most of our overall gross margin dollars in 2010 and 2009 from the sale of platforms in the pc client group and data center group operating segments 

pc client group 

the revenue and operating income for the pc client group pccg for the three years ended december 31 2011 were as follows 

 

 net revenue for the pccg operating segment increased by 51 billion or 17 in 2011 compared to 2010 platforms within pccg include those designed for the notebook and desktop computing market segments the increase in revenue was due to higher notebook platform unit sales and higher notebook platform average selling prices to a lesser extent higher desktop platform average selling prices and slightly higher desktop platform unit sales also contributed to the increase 

operating income increased by 18 billion in 2011 compared to 2010 the increase in operating income was primarily due to significantly higher revenue the increase was partially offset by approximately 960 million of higher startup costs higher operating expenses platform unit costs and inventory writeoffs compared to 2010 also contributed to the offset 

for 2010 net revenue for the pccg operating segment increased by 54 billion or 22 in 2010 compared to 2009 significantly higher notebook platform unit sales were the primary driver for the increase in revenue to a lesser extent higher desktop platform unit sales and slightly higher notebook platform average selling prices also contributed to the increase 

operating income increased by 55 billion in 2010 compared to 2009 the increase in operating income was primarily due to significantly higher revenue during 2009 pccg recognized approximately 10 billion of excess capacity charges additionally lower platform unit costs in 2010 contributed to the increase in operating income these impacts were partially offset by charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2010 to repair and replace materials and systems impacted by a design issue related to our intel ® 6 series express chipset family additionally operating expenses in 2010 were higher compared to 2009

 net revenue for the dcg operating segment increased by 14 billion or 17 in 2011 compared to 2010 the increase in revenue was due to significantly higher server platform unit sales to a lesser extent slightly higher server platform average selling prices also contributed to the increase 

operating income increased by 712 million in 2011 compared to 2010 the increase in operating income was primarily due to significantly higher revenue partially offset by higher operating expenses compared to 2010 

for 2010 net revenue for the dcg operating segment increased by 22 billion or 35 in 2010 compared to 2009 the increase in revenue was primarily due to significantly higher server platform unit sales to a lesser extent higher server platform average selling prices also contributed to the increase 

operating income increased by 21 billion in 2010 compared to 2009 the increase in operating income was due to significantly higher revenue and to a lesser extent lower platform unit costs 

other intel architecture operating segments 

the revenue and operating income loss for the other intel architecture other ia operating segments including intel mobile communications imc the intelligent systems group isg the netbook and tablet group ntg and the ultramobility group umg for the three years ended december 31 2011 were as follows 

 

 net revenue for the other ia operating segments increased by 20 billion or 64 in 2011 compared to 2010 the increase was primarily due to imc revenue an operating segment formed from the acquisition of the wls business of infineon in the first quarter of 2011 to a lesser extent significantly higher embedded platform unit sales within isg also contributed to the increase these increases were partially offset by significantly lower netbook platform unit sales within ntg 

operating results for the other ia operating segments decreased by 847 million from an operating income of 270 million in 2010 to an operating loss of 577 million in 2011 the decline in operating results was primarily due to higher operating expenses within each of the other ia operating segments partially offset by higher revenue 

for 2010 net revenue for the other ia operating segments increased by 372 million or 14 in 2010 compared to 2009 the increase was due to significantly higher embedded platform unit sales within isg 

operating results for the other ia operating segments increased by 315 million from an operating loss of 45 million in 2009 to an operating income of 270 million in 2010 the increase in operating results was due to higher revenue and lower netbook platform unit costs within ntg to a lesser extent lower embedded platform unit costs within isg also contributed to the increase these increases were partially offset by higher operating expenses in ntg and isg

software and services operating segments 

the revenue and operating income loss for the software and services operating segments including mcafee the wind river software group and the software and services group for the three years ended december 31 2011 were as follows 

 

 net revenue for the software and services operating segments increased by 16 billion in 2011 compared to 2010 the increase was due to revenue from mcafee which was acquired during the first quarter of 2011 due to the revaluation of mcafee’s historic deferred revenue to fair value we excluded 204 million of revenue that would have been reported in 2011 if mcafee’s deferred revenue had not been written down due to the acquisition 

the operating loss for the software and services operating segments decreased by 143 million in 2011 compared to 2010 the decrease was due to higher revenue partially offset by higher operating expense across each of the software and services operating segments due to the revaluation of mcafee’s historic deferred revenue to fair value at the time of acquisition we excluded revenue and associated costs that would have increased operating results by 190 million in 2011 

for 2010 net revenue for the software and services operating segments increased by 149 million in 2010 compared to 2009 the increase was primarily due to significantly higher revenue from the wind river software group we acquired wind river systems inc during the third quarter of 2009 

the operating loss for the software and services operating segments increased by 75 million in 2010 compared to 2009 the increase in operating losses was due to higher operating expenses partially offset by higher revenue within the wind river software group 

 

 

operating expenses 

operating expenses for the three years ended december 31 2011 were as follows 

 

   

research and development rd spending increased by 18 billion or 27 in 2011 compared to 2010 and increased by 923 million or 16 in 2010 compared to 2009 the increase in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to the expenses of mcafee and imc and higher compensation expenses based on an increase in employees in addition lower overall process development costs due to the transition to manufacturing startup costs related to our 22nm process technology were mostly offset by higher process development costs due to rd of our nextgeneration 14nm process technology the increase in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to higher profitdependent compensation an increase in employees and higher process development costs as we transitioned from manufacturing startup costs related to our 32nm process technology to rd of our 22nm process technology 

marketing general and administrative  marketing general and administrative expenses increased 14 billion or 22 in 2011 compared to 2010 and decreased 16 billion or 20 in 2010 compared to 2009 the increase in 2011 

compared to 2010 was primarily due to the expenses of mcafee and imc higher compensation expenses based on an increase in employees and higher advertising expenses including cooperative advertising expenses the decrease in 2010 compared to 2009 was due to the 2009 charge of 1447 billion incurred as a result of the fine imposed by the european commission ec and the 125 billion payment to amd in 2009 as part of a settlement agreement these decreases were partially offset by higher advertising expenses including cooperative advertising expenses higher profitdependent compensation and to a lesser extent expenses related to our wind river software group operating segment and an expense of 100 million recognized during the fourth quarter of 2010 due to a patent crosslicense agreement that we entered into with nvidia in january 2011 see “note 17 identified intangible assets” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

rd combined with marketing general and administrative expenses were 30 of net revenue in 2011 and 2010 and 39 of net revenue in 2009

restructuring and asset impairment charges  the following table summarizes restructuring and asset impairment charges by plan for the three years ended december 31 2011 

 

 the 2009 restructuring included closing two assembly and test facilities in malaysia one facility in the philippines and one facility in china stopping production at a 200mm wafer fabrication facility in oregon and ending production at our 200mm wafer fabrication facility in california the 2006 efficiency program was designed to improve operational efficiency and financial results both programs are complete 

amortization of acquisitionrelated intangibles the increase of 242 million was primarily due to the amortization of intangibles related to the acquisitions of mcafee and the wls business of infineon both completed in the first quarter of 2011 for further information see “note 14 acquisitions” and “note 17 identified intangible assets” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k

as of december 31 2011 unrecognized sharebased compensation costs and the weighted average periods over which the costs are expected to be recognized were as follows 

 

 

as of december 31 2011 there was 13 million in unrecognized sharebased compensation costs related to rights to acquire common stock under our stock purchase plan and we expect to recognize those costs over a period of approximately one and a half months 

gains losses on equity investments and interest and other 

gains losses on equity investments net and interest and other net for the three years ended december 31 2011 were as follows 

 

 net gains on equity investments were lower in 2011 compared to 2010 we recognized lower gains on sales higher equity method losses and lower gains on thirdparty merger transactions in 2011 compared to 2010 we recognized a net gain on equity investments in 2010 compared to a net loss in 2009 in 2010 we recognized higher gains on sales higher gains on thirdparty merger transactions lower impairment charges and lower equity method losses compared to 2009

 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

  

interest and other net increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to a 164 million gain recognized upon formation of the intelge care innovations llc joint venture during 2011 for further information see “note 11 equity method and cost method investments” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k the gain was partially offset by the recognition of 41 million of interest expense in 2011 compared to zero in 2010 and lower interest income in 2011 compared to 2010 as a result of lower average investment balances we recognized interest expense in 2011 due to the issuance of 50 billion aggregate principal of senior unsecured notes in the third quarter of 2011 

interest and other net was lower in 2010 compared to 2009 on lower interest income interest income was lower as a result of lower average interest rates partially offset by higher average investment balances the average interest rate earned during 2010 decreased by approximately 05 percentage points compared to 2009 in addition lower fair value gains on our trading assets zero in 2010 and 70 million in 2009 were partially offset by lower exchange rate losses zero in 2010 and 40 million in 2009 exchange rate losses in 2009 were due to euro exposure related to our eurodenominated liability for the ec fine of 1447 billion in 2009 for further information on the ec fine see “note 29 contingencies” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

provision for taxes 

our provision for taxes and effective tax rate were as follows 

 

 we generated a higher percentage of our profits from lower tax jurisdictions in 2011 compared to 2010 positively impacting our effective tax rate for 2011 

we generated a higher percentage of our profits from higher tax jurisdictions in 2010 compared to 2009 negatively impacting our effective tax rate for 2010 the effective tax rate for 2009 was positively impacted by the reversal of previously accrued taxes of 366 million on settlements effective settlements and related remeasurements of various uncertain tax positions these impacts were partially offset by the recognition of the ec fine of 1447 billion in 2009 which was not tax deductible and therefore significantly increased our effective tax rate for 2009 for further information on the ec fine see “note 29 contingencies” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k

liquidity and capital resources 

 

 sources and uses of cash 

in millions 

 

  

 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

  

in summary our cash flows were as follows 

 

   

operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain noncash items and changes in certain assets and liabilities 

for 2011 compared to 2010 the 43 billion increase in cash provided by operating activities was due to adjustments for noncash items and higher net income the adjustments for noncash items were higher for 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to higher depreciation and amortization of intangibles as well as increases in nonacquisitionrelated deferred tax liabilities as of december 31 2011 compared to december 25 2010 income taxes paid net of refunds in 2011 compared to 2010 were 13 billion lower largely due to the tax benefit of depreciating 100 of assets placed in service in the united states in 2011 

changes in assets and liabilities as of december 31 2011 compared to december 25 2010 included the following 

   for 2011 our two largest customers accounted for 34 of our net revenue 38 in 2010 and 2009 with one of these customers accounting for 19 of our net revenue 21 in 2010 and 2009 and another customer accounting for 15 of our net revenue 17 in 2010 and 2009 these two largest customers accounted for 32 of our accounts receivable as of december 31 2011 44 as of december 25 2010 

for 2010 compared to 2009 the 55 billion increase in cash provided by operating activities was due to higher net income partially offset by adjustments for noncash items income taxes paid net of refunds in 2010 compared to 2009 were 37 billion higher primarily due to higher income before taxes in 2010 

investing activities 

investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures investment purchases sales maturities and disposals as well as cash used for acquisitions 

cash used for investing activities decreased slightly in 2011 compared to 2010 a decrease due to net maturities and sales of availableforsale investments in 2011 as compared to net purchases of availableforsale investments in 2010 was offset by higher cash paid for acquisitions of which the substantial majority was for our acquisition of mcafee in the first quarter of 2011 and an increase in capital expenditures as we build and equip our 22nm process technology manufacturing capacity our capital expenditures were 108 billion in 2011 52 billion in 2010 and 45 billion in 2009 due to expanding our network of fabrication facilities to include an additional largescale fabrication facility as well as bringing our 22nm process technology manufacturing capacity online in 2011 

the increase in cash used for investing activities in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to an increase in net purchases of availableforsale investments and to a lesser extent higher capital expenditures these increases were partially offset by a decrease in net purchases of trading assets and lower cash paid for acquisitions 

 

  

 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

  

financing activities 

financing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases of common stock payment of dividends to stockholders issuance and repayment of longterm debt and proceeds from the sale of shares through employee equity incentive plans 

the increase in cash used in financing activities in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to higher repurchases of common stock under our authorized common stock repurchase program partially offset by the issuance of longterm debt in 2011 and higher proceeds from the sale of shares through employee equity incentive plans we have an ongoing authorization since october 2005 as amended from our board of directors to repurchase up to 45 billion in shares of our common stock in open market or negotiated transactions this amount includes 20 billion of increases in the authorization limit approved by our board of directors in 2011 during 2011 we repurchased 141 billion of common stock under our authorized common stock repurchase program compared to 15 billion in 2010 as of december 31 2011 101 billion remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization limit we base our level of common stock repurchases on internal cash management decisions and this level may fluctuate proceeds from the sale of shares through employee equity incentive plans totaled 20 billion in 2011 compared to 587 million in 2010 our total dividend payments were 41 billion in 2011 compared to 35 billion in 2010 as a result of increases in quarterly cash dividends per common share we have paid a cash dividend in each of the past 77 quarters in january 2012 our board of directors declared a cash dividend of 021 per common share for the first quarter of 2012 the dividend is payable on march 1 2012 to stockholders of record on february 7 2012 

the increase in cash used in financing activities in 2010 compared to 2009 was due to the issuance of longterm debt in 2009 

liquidity 

cash generated by operations is our primary source of liquidity we maintain a diverse portfolio that we continuously analyze based on issuer industry and country as of december 31 2011 cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and marketable debt instruments included in trading assets totaled 148 billion 215 billion as of 

december 25 2010 in addition to the 148 billion we have 18 billion in loans receivable and other longterm investments that we include when assessing our investment portfolio substantially all of our investments in debt instruments are with aa2 or better rated issuers and a majority of the issuers are rated aaaa3 or better as certain countries in europe are experiencing economic uncertainty we continue to monitor the credit quality of our european sovereign and nonsovereign debt investments the credit quality of our investment portfolio within the european region remains high with substantially all of our sovereign debt investments with aaaa3 or better rated issuers and most of the nonsovereign debt issuers rated aa2 or better as of december 31 2011 our total investments located in spain italy ireland greece and portugal were approximately 50 million all of which matures in 2012 we have 1 million in unrealized losses related to these investments these countries have experienced significant economic uncertainty and credit downgrades so we will only make investments in these countries in the future if their risk profile meets our investment objectives 

our commercial paper program provides another potential source of liquidity we have an ongoing authorization from our board of directors to borrow up to 30 billion including through the issuance of commercial paper maximum borrowings under our commercial paper program during 2011 were 14 billion and 200 million of commercial paper remained outstanding as of december 31 2011 our commercial paper was rated a1 by standard  poor’s and p1 by moody’s as of december 31 2011 we also have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the sec pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt equity and other securities in the third quarter of 2011 we utilized this shelf registration statement and issued 50 billion aggregate principal of senior unsecured notes these notes were issued primarily to repurchase shares of our common stock pursuant to our common stock repurchase program and for general corporate purposes for further information on the terms of the notes see “note 21 borrowings” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

we believe that we have the financial resources needed to meet business requirements for the next 12 months including capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test working capital requirements and potential dividends common stock repurchases and acquisitions or strategic investments

fair value of financial instruments 

when determining fair value we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and we consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability for further information see “fair value” in “note 2 accounting policies” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

credit risk is factored into the valuation of financial instruments that we measure and record at fair value when fair value is determined using pricing models such as a discounted cash flow model the issuer’s credit risk or intel’s credit risk is factored into the calculation of the fair value as appropriate 

marketable debt instruments 

as of december 31 2011 our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included 151 billion of marketable debt instruments of these instruments 61 billion was classified as level 1 87 billion as level 2 and 218 million as level 3 

our balance of marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 1 was classified as such due to the use of observable market prices for identical securities that are traded in active markets management judgment was required to determine the levels for the frequency of transactions that should be met for a market to be considered active our assessment of an active market for our marketable debt instruments generally takes into consideration the number of days each individual instrument trades over a specified period 

of the 87 billion balance of marketable debt instruments measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 2 approximately 60 of the balance was 

classified as level 2 due to the use of a discounted cash flow model and approximately 40 due to the use of nonbinding market consensus prices that were corroborated with observable market data 

our marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 3 were classified as such due to the lack of observable market data to corroborate either the nonbinding market consensus prices or the nonbinding broker quotes when observable market data is not available we corroborate our fair value measurements using nonbinding market consensus prices and nonbinding broker quotes from a second source 

loans receivable 

as of december 31 2011 our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included 748 million of loans receivable all of these securities were classified as level 2 as the fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of december 31 2011 

 

  

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services include agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on intel and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction for obligations with cancellation provisions the amounts included in the preceding table were limited to the noncancelable portion of the agreement terms or the minimum cancellation fee 

we have entered into certain agreements for the purchase of raw materials that specify minimum prices and quantities based on a percentage of the total available market or based on a percentage of our future purchasing requirements due to the uncertainty of the future market and our future 

purchasing requirements as well as the nonbinding nature of these agreements obligations under these agreements are not included in the preceding table our purchase orders for other products are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons in addition some of our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 

contractual obligations that are contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones are not included in the preceding table these obligations include milestonebased comarketing agreements contingent fundingpayment obligations and milestonebased equity investment funding these arrangements are not considered contractual obligations until the milestone is met by the third party 

 

  

 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

  

for the majority of restricted stock units granted the number of shares issued on the date the restricted stock units vest is net of the minimum statutory withholding requirements that we pay in cash to the appropriate taxing authorities on behalf of our employees the obligation to pay the relevant taxing authority is not included in the preceding table as the amount is contingent upon continued employment in addition the amount of the obligation is unknown as it is based in part on the market price of our common stock when the awards vest 

contractual obligations with regard to our investment in imftimfs are not included in the preceding table we are currently committed to purchasing 49 of imft’s and 22 of imfs’s production output and productionrelated services we also have several agreements with micron related to ip and rd funding related to nonvolatile memory manufacturing the obligation to purchase our proportion of 

imftimfs’s inventory was approximately 125 million as of december 31 2011 for further information see “note 11 equity method and cost method investments” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

the expected timing of payments of the obligations above is estimated based on current information timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations 

offbalancesheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2011 we did not have any significant offbalancesheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend we use derivative financial instruments primarily to manage currency exchange rate and interest rate risk and to a lesser extent equity market risk all of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial positions as of december 31 2011 and december 25 2010 actual results may differ materially 

currency exchange rates 

in general we economically hedge currency risks of nonusdollardenominated investments in debt instruments and loans receivable with currency forward contracts or currency interest rate swaps gains and losses on these nonuscurrency investments would generally be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments resulting in an insignificant net exposure to loss 

substantially all of our revenue is transacted in us dollars however a significant amount of our operating expenditures and capital purchases is incurred in or exposed to other currencies primarily the japanese yen the euro the israeli shekel and the chinese yuan we have established balance sheet and forecasted transaction currency risk management programs to protect against fluctuations in fair value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in exchange rates we generally utilize currency forward contracts in these hedging programs our hedging programs reduce but do not always entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements for further information see “risk factors” in part i item 1a of this form 10k we considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that a weighted average adverse change of 20 in currency exchange rates could be experienced in the near term such an adverse change after taking into account balance sheet hedges only and offsetting recorded monetary asset and liability positions would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before taxes of less than 40 million as of december 31 2011 less than 35 million as of december 25 2010 

interest rates 

we generally hedge interest rate risks of fixedrate debt instruments with interest rate swaps gains and losses on these investments would generally be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments resulting in an insignificant net exposure to interest rate loss 

we are exposed to interest rate risk related to our investment portfolio and indebtedness our indebtedness includes our debt issuances and the liability associated with a longterm patent crosslicense agreement with nvidia for further information see “note 17 identified intangible assets” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k the primary objective of our investments in debt instruments is to preserve principal while maximizing yields which generally track the usdollar threemonth libor a hypothetical decrease in interest rates of 10 would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our indebtedness of approximately 900 million as of december 31 2011 an increase of approximately 250 million as of december 25 2010 the significant increase from december 25 2010 is primarily driven by the inclusion of the 50 billion of senior unsecured notes issued in the third quarter of 2011 a hypothetical decrease in interest rates of up to 10 after taking into account investment hedges would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our investment portfolio of approximately 20 million as of december 31 2011 an increase of approximately 15 million as of december 25 2010 the fluctuations in fair value of our investment portfolio and indebtedness reflect only the direct impact of the change in interest rates other economic variables such as equity market fluctuations and changes in relative credit risk could result in a significantly higher decline in the fair value of our net investment position for further information on how credit risk is factored into the valuation of our investment portfolio and debt issuances see “note 5 fair value” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

equity prices 

our marketable equity investments include marketable equity securities and equity derivative instruments such as warrants and options to the extent that our marketable equity securities have strategic value we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our equity market exposure through hedging activities however for our investments in strategic equity derivative instruments we may enter into transactions to reduce or eliminate the equity market risks for securities that we no longer consider strategic we evaluate legal market and economic factors in our decision on the timing of disposal and whether it is possible and appropriate to hedge the equity market risk 

we hold derivative instruments that seek to offset changes in liabilities related to the equity market risks of certain deferred compensation arrangements the gains and losses from changes in fair value of these derivatives are designed to offset the gains and losses on the related liabilities resulting in an insignificant net exposure to loss 

 

  

 as of december 31 2011 the fair value of our marketable equity investments and our equity derivative instruments including hedging positions was 585 million 15 billion as of december 25 2010 our marketable equity investment in imagination technologies group plc was carried at a total fair market value of 327 million or 56 of our marketable equity portfolio as of december 31 2011 our marketable equity method investments are excluded from our analysis as the carrying value does not fluctuate based on market price changes unless an otherthantemporary impairment is deemed necessary to determine reasonably possible decreases in the market value of our marketable equity investments we analyzed the expected market price sensitivity of our marketable equity investment portfolio assuming a loss of 45 in market prices and after reflecting the impact of hedges and offsetting positions the aggregate value of our marketable equity investments could decrease by approximately 265 million based on the value as of december 31 2011 a decrease in value of approximately 365 million based on the value as of december 25 2010 using an assumed loss of 40 

many of the same factors that could result in an adverse movement of equity market prices affect our nonmarketable equity investments although we cannot always quantify the impact directly financial markets are volatile which could negatively affect the prospects of the companies we invest in their ability to raise additional capital and the likelihood of our being able to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings mergers and private sales these types of investments involve a great deal of risk and there can be no assurance that any specific company will grow or become successful consequently we could lose all or part of our investment our nonmarketable equity investments excluding investments accounted for under the equity method had a carrying amount of 11 billion as of december 31 2011 872 million as of december 25 2010 as of december 31 2011 the carrying amount of our nonmarketable equity method investments was 16 billion 18 billion as of december 25 2010 approximately half of the total nonmarketable equity investments balance as of december 31 2011 was concentrated in our imftimfs investment of 13 billion 15 billion as of december 25 2010

we are focusing our rd efforts on advanced computing technologies developing new microarchitectures advancing our silicon manufacturing process technology delivering the next generation of microprocessors and chipsets improving our platform initiatives and developing software solutions and tools to support our technologies our rd efforts enable new levels of performance and address areas such as energy efficiency security scalability for multicore architectures system manageability and ease of use we continue to make significant rd investments in the development of socs to enable growth in areas such as handheld devices embedded applications and consumer electronics in addition we continue to make significant investments in wireless technologies graphics and highperformance computing 

 

as part of our rd efforts we plan to introduce a new microarchitecture for our notebook desktop and intel xeon processors approximately every two years and ramp the next generation of silicon process technology in the intervening years we refer to this as our “ticktock” technology development cadence in 2010 we introduced our 2nd generation intel core microarchitecture a new microarchitecture using our existing 32nm process technology we are currently developing 22nm process technology our nextgeneration process technology and expect to begin manufacturing products using that technology in the second half of 2011 our leadership in silicon technology has enabled us to make “moore’s law” a reality moore’s law predicted that transistor density on integrated circuits would double about every two years our leadership in silicon technology has also helped expand on the advances anticipated by moore’s law by bringing new capabilities into silicon and producing new products and platforms optimized for a wider variety of applications 

 

our rd model is based on a global organization that emphasizes a collaborative approach to identifying and developing new technologies leading standards initiatives and influencing regulatory policies to accelerate the adoption of new technologies our rd initiatives are performed by various internal business groups and we centrally manage key crossbusiness group product initiatives to align and prioritize our rd activities across these groups in addition we may augment our rd initiatives by investing in companies or entering into agreements with companies that have similar rd focus areas for example we have an agreement with micron for joint development of nand flash memory technologies 

 

employees 

 

as of december 25 2010 we had 82500 employees worldwide with approximately 55 of those employees located in the us 

 

sales and marketing 

 

customers 

 

we sell our products primarily to original equipment manufacturers oems and original design manufacturers odms odms provide design andor manufacturing services to branded and unbranded privatelabel resellers in addition we sell our products to other manufacturers including makers of a wide range of industrial and communications equipment our customers also include those who buy pc components and our other products through distributor reseller retail and oem channels throughout the world 

our worldwide reseller sales channel consists of thousands of indirect customers—systems builders that purchase intel microprocessors and other products from our distributors we have a boxed processor program that allows distributors to sell intel microprocessors in small quantities to these systemsbuilder customers boxed processors are also available in direct retail outlets 

 

in 2010 hewlettpackard company accounted for 21 of our net revenue 21 in 2009 and 20 in 2008 and dell inc accounted for 17 of our net revenue 17 in 2009 and 18 in 2008 no other customer accounted for more than 10 of our net revenue for information about revenue and operating income by operating segment and revenue from unaffiliated customers by geographic regioncountry see “results of operations” in part ii item 7 and “note 30 operating segment and geographic information” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

 

sales arrangements 

 

our products are sold through sales offices throughout the world sales of our products are typically made via purchase order acknowledgments that contain standard terms and conditions covering matters such as pricing payment terms and warranties as well as indemnities for issues specific to our products such as patent and copyright indemnities from time to time we may enter into additional agreements with customers covering for example changes from our standard terms and conditions new product development and marketing privatelabel branding and other matters most of our sales are made using electronic and webbased processes that allow the customer to review inventory availability and track the progress of specific goods ordered pricing on particular products may vary based on volumes ordered and other factors we also offer discounts rebates and other incentives to customers to increase acceptance of our products and technology 

 

our products are typically shipped under terms that transfer title to the customer even in arrangements for which the recognition of revenue and related costs of sales is deferred our standard terms and conditions of sale typically provide that payment is due at a later date generally 30 days after shipment or delivery our credit department sets accounts receivable and shipping limits for individual customers to control credit risk to intel arising from outstanding account balances we assess credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis and from this analysis we establish credit limits and determine whether we will seek to use one or more credit support devices such as obtaining some form of thirdparty guarantee or standby letter of credit or obtaining credit insurance for all or a portion of the account balance if necessary credit losses may still be incurred due to bankruptcy fraud or other failure of the customer to pay for information about our allowance for doubtful receivables see “schedule ii—valuation and qualifying accounts” in part iv of this form 10k 

 

most of our sales to distributors are made under agreements allowing for price protection on unsold merchandise and a right of return on stipulated quantities of unsold merchandise under the price protection program we give distributors credits for the difference between the original price paid and the current price that we offer on most products there is no contractual limit on the amount of price protection nor is there a limit on the time horizon under which price protection is granted the right of return granted generally consists of a stock rotation program in which distributors are able to exchange certain products based on the number of qualified purchases made by the distributor we have the option to grant credit for repair or replace defective products and there is no contractual limit on the amount of credit that may be granted to a distributor for defective products 

 

distribution 

 

distributors typically handle a wide variety of products including those that compete with our products and fill orders for many customers we also utilize thirdparty sales representatives who generally do not offer directly competitive products but may carry complementary items manufactured by others sales representatives do not maintain a product inventory instead their customers place orders directly with us or through distributors we have several distribution warehouses that are located in close proximity to key customers 

 

backlog 

 

we do not believe that backlog as of any particular date is meaningful as our sales are made primarily pursuant to standard purchase orders for delivery of products only a small portion of our orders is noncancelable and the dollar amount associated with the noncancelable portion is not significant 

 

seasonal trends 

 

our microprocessor sales generally have followed a seasonal trend historically our sales have been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year accelerating in the third quarter and peaking in the fourth quarter consumer purchases of pcs have historically been higher in the second half of the year primarily due to backtoschool and holiday demand in addition purchases from businesses have also historically tended to be higher in the second half of the year 

marketing 

 

our corporate marketing objectives are to build a strong wellknown intel corporate brand that connects with businesses and consumers and to offer a limited number of meaningful and valuable brands in our portfolio to aid businesses and consumers in making informed choices about technology purchases the intel core processor family and the intel atom intel ® pentium ®  intel ® celeron ®  intel xeon and intel itanium trademarks make up our processor brands 

 

we promote brand awareness and generate demand through our own direct marketing as well as comarketing programs our direct marketing activities include television print and internet advertising as well as press relations consumer and trade events and industry and consumer communications we market to consumer and business audiences and focus on building awareness and generating demand for increased performance improved energy efficiency and other capabilities such as internet connectivity and security 

 

purchases by customers often allow them to participate in cooperative advertising and marketing programs such as the intel inside ® program this program broadens the reach of our brands beyond the scope of our own direct marketing through the intel inside program certain customers are licensed to place intel logos on computers containing our microprocessors and processor technologies and to use our brands in their marketing activities the program includes a market development component that accrues funds based on purchases and partially reimburses the oems for marketing activities for products featuring intel brands subject to the oems meeting defined criteria these marketing activities primarily include television print and internet marketing we have also entered into joint marketing arrangements with certain customers 

 

competition 

 

the semiconductor industry is dynamic characterized by rapid advances in technology and frequent product introductions as unit volumes of a product grow production experience is accumulated and costs typically decrease further competition develops and prices decline the life cycle of our products is very short sometimes less than a year these short product life cycles and other factors lead to frequent negotiations with our oem customers which typically are large sophisticated buyers who are also operating in very competitive environments our ability to compete depends on our ability to navigate this environment by improving our products and processes faster than our competitors anticipating changing customer requirements developing and launching new products and platforms pricing our products competitively and reducing average unit cost see “risk factors” in part i item 1a of this form 10k 

 

our products compete primarily based on performance energy efficiency features price quality reliability brand recognition and availability we are focused on offering innovative products and worldwide support for our customers at competitive prices including providing improved energyefficient performance enhanced security and internet connectivity we believe that our computing platforms which we define as integrated hardware and software computing technologies that are designed to provide an optimized solution provide us with a competitive advantage compared to components that are used separately 

 

we believe that our network of manufacturing facilities and assembly and test facilities gives us a competitive advantage this network enables us to have more direct control over our processes quality control product cost volume timing of production and other factors these facilities require significant upfront capital spending and therefore make it difficult for us to reduce our costs in the short term many of our competitors do not own such facilities because they may not be able to afford to do so or because their business models involve the use of thirdparty foundries and assembly and test subcontractors for manufacturing and assembly and test the thirdparty foundries and subcontractors may also offer intellectual property design services and other goods and services to our competitors these “fabless” semiconductor companies include broadcom corporation nvidia corporation qualcomm incorporated and via technologies inc some of our competitors such as advanced micro devices inc amd own portions of such facilities through investment or jointventure arrangements with other companies 

 

we plan to continue to cultivate new businesses and work with the computing and communications industries through standards bodies trade associations oems odms and independent software and operating system vendors to help align the industry to offer products that take advantage of the latest market trends and usage models we frequently participate in industry initiatives designed to discuss and agree upon technical specifications and other aspects of technologies that could be adopted as standards by standardssetting organizations our competitors may also participate in the same initiatives and specification development our participation does not ensure that any standards or specifications adopted by these organizations will be consistent with our product planning 

microprocessors 

 

we continue to be largely dependent on the success of our microprocessor business our ability to compete depends on our ability to deliver new microprocessor products with increased performance capabilities and improved energyefficient performance at competitive prices some of our microprocessor competitors such as amd market softwarecompatible products that compete with our processors we also face competition from companies offering rival architecture designs such as cell broadband engine architecture developed jointly by international business machines corporation ibm sony corporation and toshiba corporation power architecture offered by ibm arm architecture developed by arm limited and sun scalable processor architecture sparc offered by oracle corporation in addition nvidia has begun developing cpus based on the arm architecture to combine with its graphics processors and has shifted some of the workload traditionally performed by the microprocessor to its graphics processor 

 

amd has been our primary competitor in the market segments for microprocessors used in notebooks desktops and servers while companies using armbased designs are our primary competitors in the growing market segments for microprocessors used in handheld devices and tablets companies using armbased designs are also targeting the notebook netbook and server market segments arm does not manufacture microprocessors they design and license semiconductor intellectual property and offer supporting software and services our ability to compete with armbased competitors depends on our ability to design and produce highperformance energyefficient microprocessors at competitive prices it also requires us to develop a software ecosystem that appeals to end users and software developers we have taken a number of steps to build this software ecosystem including the development of meego a linuxbased software platform that will run on multiple hardware platforms acquiring mcafee inc which we expect to complete in the first quarter of 2011 and wind river systems inc and creating the intel ® atom tm developer program 

 

the following is a list of our main microprocessor competitors by market segment 

  

 

  

chipsets 

 

our chipsets compete with chipsets produced by companies such as amd including chipsets marketed under the ati technologies inc brand broadcom nvidia silicon integrated systems corporation and via we also compete with companies offering graphics components and other specialpurpose products used in the notebook netbook desktop and workstation market segments one aspect of our business model is to incorporate improved performance and advanced properties into our microprocessors and chipsets for which demand may increasingly be affected by competition from companies whose business models are based on dedicated chipsets and other components such as graphics controllers 

 

flash memory 

 

our nand flash memory products currently compete with nand products primarily manufactured by hynix semiconductor inc micron samsung sandisk corporation and toshiba 

 

connectivity 

 

we offer products designed for wireless and wired connectivity and network processors our wifi and wimax products currently compete with products manufactured by atheros communications inc broadcom qualcomm and other smaller companies 

 

competition lawsuits and government matters 

 

we are currently a party to lawsuits and government matters involving our competitive practices see “note 29 contingencies” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

acquisitions and strategic investments 

 

we expect to complete the acquisition of mcafee in the first quarter of 2011 mcafee is a provider of security products and services that help secure systems and networks as a result of the acquisition we expect to hire approximately 6400 mcafee employees mcafee’s offerings will include endpoint security products system security products consumer security products network security products and risk and compliance products many of mcafee’s products are offered under a softwareasaservice delivery model an online console used to manage and update hardware and software which reduces onpremise capital expenses the anticipated acquisition of mcafee reflects our belief that security is a fundamental component of online computing as we develop future products and services security considerations will be as important as our continued focus on energyefficient performance and internet connectivity 

 

in the first quarter of 2011 we completed the acquisition of the wls business of infineon as a result of the acquisition we expect to hire approximately 3700 employees from infineon the wls business will operate as intel mobile communications and offer mobile phone components such as baseband processors radio frequency transceivers and power management chips in addition to managing the existing wls business the objective of the acquisition is to contribute to our strategy to provide solutions with internet connectivity to a broad range of computing devices 

 

during 2009 we completed the acquisition of wind river systems a vendor of software for embedded devices the objective of the acquisition of wind river systems was to enable the introduction of products for the embedded and handheld market segments resulting in benefits for our existing operations 

 

for further information see “note 15 acquisitions” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

 

intellectual property and licensing 

 

intellectual property rights that apply to our products and services include patents copyrights trade secrets trademarks and maskwork rights we maintain a program to protect our investment in technology by attempting to ensure respect for our intellectual property rights the extent of the legal protection given to different types of intellectual property rights varies under different countries’ legal systems we intend to license our intellectual property rights where we can obtain adequate consideration see “competition” earlier in this section “risk factors” in part i item 1a and “note 29 contingencies” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

 

we have filed and obtained a number of patents in the us and other countries while our patents are an important element of our success our business as a whole is not significantly dependent on any one patent because of the fast pace of innovation and product development our products are often obsolete before the patents related to them expire and sometimes are obsolete before the patents related to them are even granted as we expand our product offerings into new industries we also seek to extend our patent development efforts to patent such product offerings established competitors in existing and new industries as well as companies that purchase and enforce patents and other intellectual property may already have patents covering similar products there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain patents covering our own products or that we will be able to obtain licenses from such companies on favorable terms or at all 

 

the majority of the software that we distribute including software embedded in our componentlevel and systemlevel products is entitled to copyright protection to distinguish intel products from our competitors’ products we have obtained certain trademarks and trade names for our products and we maintain cooperative advertising programs with certain customers to promote our brands and to identify products containing genuine intel components we also protect certain details about our processes products and strategies as trade secrets keeping confidential the information that we believe provides us with a competitive advantage 

 

compliance with environmental health and safety regulations 

 

our compliance efforts focus on monitoring regulatory and resource trends and setting companywide performance targets for key resources and emissions these targets address several parameters including product design chemical energy and water use climate change waste recycling and emissions 

 

intel focuses on reducing natural resource use the solid and chemical waste byproducts of our manufacturing processes and the environmental impact of our products we currently use a variety of materials in our manufacturing process that have the potential to adversely impact the environment and are subject to a variety of ehs laws and regulations over the past several years we have significantly reduced the use of lead and halogenated flame retardants in our products and manufacturing processes 

we work with the us environmental protection agency epa nongovernmental organizations oems and retailers to help manage ewaste which includes electronic products nearing the end of their useful lives and promote recycling the european union requires producers of certain electrical and electronic equipment to develop programs that allow consumers to return products for recycling many states in the us have similar ewaste takeback laws although these laws are typically targeted at the end electronic product and not the component products that intel manufactures the inconsistency of many ewaste takeback laws and the lack of local ewaste management options in many areas pose a challenge for our compliance efforts 

 

intel seeks to reduce our global greenhouse gas emissions by investing in energy conservation projects in our factories and working with suppliers to improve energy efficiency we take a holistic approach to power management addressing the challenge at the silicon package circuit micromacro architecture platform and software levels we recognize that climate change may cause general economic risk for further information on the risks of climate change see “risk factors” in part i item 1a of this form 10k we see the potential for higher energy costs driven by climate change regulations this could include items applied to utilities that are passed along to customers such as carbon taxes or costs associated with obtaining permits for our us manufacturing operations emission cap and trade programs or renewable portfolio standards 

 

we are committed to sustainability and take a leadership position in promoting voluntary environmental initiatives and working proactively with governments environmental groups and industry to promote global environmental sustainability we believe that technology will be fundamental to finding solutions to the world’s environmental challenges and we are joining forces with industry business and governments to find and promote ways that technology can be used as a tool to combat climate change 

 

we have been purchasing wind power and other forms of renewable energy at some of our major sites for several years at the beginning of 2008 we announced plans to purchase renewable energy certificates under a multiyear contract the purchase has placed intel at the top of the epa’s green power partnership for the past three years and was intended to help stimulate the market for green power leading to additional generating capacity and ultimately lower costs 

executive officers of the registrant 

 

the following sets forth certain information with regard to our executive officers as of february 18 2011 ages are as of december 25 2010 

 

 

 

tablestart 


 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

fluctuations in demand for our products may harm our financial results and are difficult to forecast 

if demand for our products fluctuates our revenue and profitability could be harmed important factors that could cause demand for our products to fluctuate include 

  

if product demand decreases our manufacturing or assembly and test capacity could be underutilized and we may be required to record an impairment on our longlived assets including facilities and equipment as well as intangible assets which would increase our expenses in addition if product demand decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately we could be required to write off inventory or record excess capacity charges which would have a negative impact on our gross margin factoryplanning decisions may shorten the useful lives of longlived assets including facilities and equipment and cause us to accelerate depreciation in the long term if product demand increases we may not be able to add manufacturing or assembly and test capacity fast enough to meet market demand these changes in demand for our products and changes in our customers’ product needs could have a variety of negative effects on our competitive position and our financial results and in certain cases may reduce our revenue increase our costs lower our gross margin percentage or require us to recognize impairments of our assets 

 

the semiconductor industry and our operations are characterized by a high percentage of costs that are fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term and by product demand that is highly variable and subject to significant downturns that may harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

the semiconductor industry and our operations are characterized by high costs such as those related to facility construction and equipment rd and employment and training of a highly skilled workforce that are either fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term at the same time demand for our products is highly variable and there have been downturns often in connection with maturing product cycles and general economic market conditions these downturns have been characterized by reduced product demand manufacturing overcapacity and resulting excess capacity charges high inventory levels and lower average selling prices the combination of these factors may cause our revenue gross margin cash flow and profitability to vary significantly in both the short and long term 

 

we operate in intensely competitive industries and our failure to respond quickly to technological developments and incorporate new features into our products could harm our ability to compete 

we operate in intensely competitive industries that experience rapid technological developments changes in industry standards changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and improvements if we are unable to respond quickly and successfully to these developments we may lose our competitive position and our products or technologies may become uncompetitive or obsolete as new computing market segments emerge such as netbooks handhelds tablets and consumer electronics devices we face new sources of competition and customers that have different requirements than customers in our traditional pc business to be successful we need to cultivate new industry relationships in these market segments as the number and variety of internetconnected devices increase we need to improve the cost energy efficiency and security functionality of our microprocessors to succeed in these new market segments in addition we need to focus on the acquisition and development of our software capabilities in order to provide customers with complete computing solutions 

 

to compete successfully we must maintain a successful rd effort develop new products and production processes and improve our existing products and processes at the same pace or ahead of our competitors our rd efforts are aimed at solving increasingly complex problems and we do not expect that all of our projects will be successful if our rd efforts are unsuccessful our future results of operations could be materially harmed we may not be able to develop and market these new products successfully the products we invest in and develop may not be well received by customers and products developed and new technologies offered by others may affect demand for our products these types of events could have a variety of negative effects on our competitive position and our financial results such as reducing our revenue increasing our costs lowering our gross margin percentage and requiring us to recognize impairments on our assets 

litigation or regulatory proceedings could harm our business 

we may be subject to legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder consumer competition and other issues on a global basis as described in “note 29 contingencies” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k we are currently engaged in a number of litigation and regulatory matters litigation and regulatory proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur an unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or in cases for which injunctive relief is sought an injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing or selling one or more products precluding particular business practices or requiring other remedies such as compulsory licensing of intellectual property if we were to receive an unfavorable ruling in a matter our business and results of operations could be materially harmed 

 

fluctuations in the mix of products sold may harm our financial results 

because of the wide price differences among and within notebook netbook tablet desktop and server microprocessors the mix and types of performance capabilities of microprocessors sold affect the average selling price of our products and have a substantial impact on our revenue and gross margin our financial results also depend in part on the mix of other products that we sell such as chipsets flash memory and other semiconductor products in addition more recently introduced products tend to have higher associated costs because of initial overall development and production ramp fluctuations in the mix and types of our products may also affect the extent to which we are able to recover the fixed costs and investments associated with a particular product and as a result can harm our financial results 

 

our global operations subject us to risks that may harm our results of operations and financial condition 

we have sales offices rd manufacturing and assembly and test facilities in many countries and some business activities may be concentrated in one or more geographic areas as a result we are subject to risks that may limit our ability to manufacture assemble and test design develop or sell products in particular countries or on a geographic basis which could harm our results of operations and financial condition including 

  

violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation although we have implemented policies controls and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws our employees contractors or agents may violate our policies 

 

in addition although substantially all of our products are sold in us dollars we incur a significant amount of certain types of expenses such as payroll utilities tax and marketing expenses as well as conduct certain investing and financing activities in local currencies our hedging programs reduce but do not entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements therefore fluctuations in exchange rates could harm our results and financial condition in addition changes in tariff and import regulations and in us and nonus monetary policies may harm our results and financial condition by increasing our expenses and reducing our revenue varying tax rates in different jurisdictions could harm our results of operations and financial condition by increasing our overall tax rate 

 

we maintain a program of insurance coverage for various types of property casualty and other risks we place our insurance coverage with various carriers in numerous jurisdictions however there is a risk that one or more of our insurance providers may be unable to pay a claim the types and amounts of insurance that we obtain vary from time to time and from location to location depending on availability cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention the policies are subject to deductibles and exclusions that result in our retention of a level of risk on a selfinsurance basis losses not covered by insurance may be substantial which could harm our results of operations and financial condition 

failure to meet our production targets resulting in undersupply or oversupply of products may harm our business and results of operations 

production of integrated circuits is a complex process disruptions in this process can result from interruptions in our processes errors and difficulties in our development and implementation of new processes defects in materials disruptions in our supply of materials or resources and disruptions at our fabrication and assembly and test facilities due to for example accidents maintenance issues or unsafe working conditions—all of which could affect the timing of production ramps and yields we may not be successful or efficient in developing or implementing new production processes the occurrence of any of the foregoing may result in our failure to meet or increase production as desired resulting in higher costs or substantial decreases in yields which could affect our ability to produce sufficient volume to meet specific product demand the unavailability or reduced availability of certain products could make it more difficult to deliver computing platforms the occurrence of any of these events could harm our business and results of operations 

 

we may have difficulties obtaining the resources or products we need for manufacturing assembling and testing our products or operating other aspects of our business which could harm our ability to meet demand for our products and may increase our costs 

we have thousands of suppliers providing various materials that we use in the production of our products and other aspects of our business and we seek where possible to have several sources of supply for all of those materials however we may rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers or upon suppliers in a single country for these materials the inability of such suppliers to deliver adequate supplies of production materials or other supplies could disrupt our production processes or could make it more difficult for us to implement our business strategy in addition production could be disrupted by the unavailability of the resources used in production such as water silicon electricity gases and other materials future environmental regulations could restrict the supply or increase the cost of certain of the materials that we currently use in our business environmental regulations also may make it more difficult to obtain permits to build or modify additional manufacturing capacity to meet demand the unavailability or reduced availability of the materials or resources that we use in our business may require us to reduce production of products or may require us to incur additional costs in order to obtain an adequate supply of those materials or resources the occurrence of any of these events could harm our business and results of operations 

 

costs related to product defects and errata may harm our results of operations and business 

costs associated with unexpected product defects and errata deviations from published specifications due to for example unanticipated problems in our design and manufacturing processes could include 

  

these costs could be substantial and may therefore increase our expenses and lower our gross margin in addition our reputation with our customers or users of our products could be damaged as a result of such product defects and errata and the demand for our products could be reduced the announcement of product defects andor errata could cause customers to purchase products from our competitors as a result of anticipated shortages of intel components or for other reasons these factors could harm our financial results and the prospects for our business 

 

we may be subject to claims of infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights which could harm our business 

third parties may assert against us or our customers alleged patent copyright trademark or other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our business we are currently engaged in a number of litigation matters involving intellectual property rights we may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims from certain individuals and companies including those who have acquired patent portfolios for the sole purpose of asserting such claims against other companies any claims that our products or processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others regardless of the merit or resolution of such claims could cause us to incur significant costs in responding to defending and resolving such claims and may divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from our business as a result of such intellectual property infringement claims we could be required or otherwise decide that it is appropriate to 

  

the occurrence of any of the foregoing could result in unexpected expenses or require us to recognize an impairment of our assets which would reduce the value of our assets and increase expenses in addition if we alter or discontinue our production of affected items our revenue could be harmed 

we may not be able to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights which may harm our ability to compete and harm our business 

our ability to enforce our patents copyrights software licenses and other intellectual property rights is subject to general litigation risks as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our intellectual property rights in various countries when we seek to enforce our rights we are often subject to claims that the intellectual property right is invalid is otherwise not enforceable or is licensed to the party against whom we are asserting a claim in addition our assertion of intellectual property rights often results in the other party seeking to assert alleged intellectual property rights of its own or assert other claims against us which could harm our business if we are not ultimately successful in defending ourselves against these claims in litigation we may not be able to sell a particular product or family of products due to an injunction or we may have to license the technology or pay damages that could in turn harm our results of operations in addition governments may adopt regulations and governments or courts may render decisions requiring compulsory licensing of intellectual property to others or governments may require that products meet specified standards that serve to favor local companies our inability to enforce our intellectual property rights under these circumstances may harm our competitive position and our business 

 

we may be subject to intellectual property theft or misuse which could result in thirdparty claims and harm our business and results of operations 

we regularly face attempts by others to gain unauthorized access through the internet to our information technology systems such as when they masquerade as authorized users or surreptitiously introduce software these attempts which might be the result of industrial or other espionage or actions by hackers seeking to harm the company its products or end users are sometimes successful we seek to detect and investigate these security incidents and to prevent their recurrence but in some cases we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information as a result of such an incident could adversely affect our competitive position and reduce marketplace acceptance of our products the value of our investment in rd product development and marketing could be reduced and third parties might assert against us or our customers claims related to resulting losses of confidential or proprietary information or enduser data or system reliability our business could be subject to significant disruption and we could suffer monetary and other losses including the cost of product recalls and returns and reputational harm in the event of such incidents and claims 

 

our licenses with other companies and our participation in industry initiatives may allow other companies including our competitors to use our patent rights 

companies in the semiconductor industry often rely on the ability to license patents from each other in order to compete many of our competitors have broad licenses or crosslicenses with us and under current case law some of the licenses may permit these competitors to pass our patent rights on to others if one of these licensees becomes a foundry our competitors might be able to avoid our patent rights in manufacturing competing products in addition our participation in industry initiatives may require us to license our patents to other companies that adopt certain industry standards or specifications even when such organizations do not adopt standards or specifications proposed by us as a result our patents implicated by our participation in industry initiatives might not be available for us to enforce against others who might otherwise be deemed to be infringing those patents our costs of enforcing our licenses or protecting our patents may increase and the value of our intellectual property may be impaired 

 

we invest in companies for strategic reasons and may not realize a return on our investments 

we make investments in companies around the world to further our strategic objectives and support our key business initiatives such investments include equity or debt instruments of public or private companies and many of these instruments are nonmarketable at the time of our initial investment these companies range from earlystage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models the success of these companies is dependent on product development market acceptance operational efficiency and other key business factors the companies in which we invest may fail because they may not be able to secure additional funding obtain favorable investment terms for future financings or participate in liquidity events such as public offerings mergers and private sales if any of these private companies fail we could lose all or part of our investment in that company if we determine that an otherthantemporary decline in the fair value exists for an equity or debt investment in a public or private company in which we have invested we write down the investment to its fair value and recognize the related writedown as an investment loss we also have significant investments in companies in the flash memory market segment and declines in this market segment or changes in management’s plans with respect to our investments in this market segment could result in significant impairment charges impacting gains losses on equity method investments net and gains losses on other equity investments net 

 

when the strategic objectives of an investment have been achieved or if the investment or business diverges from our strategic objectives we may decide to dispose of the investment we may incur losses on the disposal of our nonmarketable investments additionally for cases in which we are required under equity method accounting to recognize a proportionate share of another company’s income or loss such income or loss may impact our earnings gains or losses from equity securities could vary from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of securities gains or losses from equity method investments and impairment charges for equity and other investments 

our results of operations could vary as a result of the methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies 

the methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations see “critical accounting estimates” in part ii item 7 of this form 10k such methods estimates and judgments are by their nature subject to substantial risks uncertainties and assumptions and factors may arise over time that lead us to change our methods estimates and judgments changes in those methods estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations 

 

decisions about the scope of operations of our business could affect our results of operations and financial condition 

changes in the business environment could lead to changes in our decisions about the scope of operations of our business and these changes could result in restructuring and asset impairment charges factors that could affect our results of operations and financial condition with regard to changing the scope of our operations include 

  

our acquisitions divestitures and other transactions could disrupt our ongoing business and harm our results of operations 

in pursuing our business strategy we routinely conduct discussions evaluate opportunities and enter into agreements regarding possible investments acquisitions divestitures and other transactions such as joint ventures acquisitions and other transactions involve significant challenges and risks including risks that 

  

when we decide to sell assets or a business we may encounter difficulty in finding or completing divestiture opportunities or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner and the agreed terms and financing arrangements could be renegotiated due to changes in business or market conditions these circumstances could delay the accomplishment of our strategic objectives or cause us to incur additional expenses with respect to businesses that we want to dispose of or we may dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are less favorable than we had anticipated resulting in a loss on the transaction 

 

if we do enter into agreements with respect to acquisitions divestitures or other transactions we may fail to complete them due to factors such as 

  

in order to compete we must attract retain and motivate key employees and our failure to do so could harm our results of operations 

in order to compete we must attract retain and motivate executives and other key employees hiring and retaining qualified executives scientists engineers technical staff and sales representatives are critical to our business and competition for experienced employees in the semiconductor industry can be intense to help attract retain and motivate qualified employees we use sharebased incentive awards such as nonvested share units restricted stock units and employee stock options if the value of such stock awards does not appreciate as measured by the performance of the price of our common stock or if our sharebased compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit our ability to attract retain and motivate employees could be weakened which could harm our results of operations 

our failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations worldwide could harm our business and results of operations 

the manufacturing and assembling and testing of our products require the use of hazardous materials that are subject to a broad array of ehs laws and regulations our failure to comply with any of those applicable laws or regulations could result in 

  

in addition our failure to manage the use transportation emissions discharge storage recycling or disposal of hazardous materials could subject us to increased costs or future liabilities existing and future environmental laws and regulations could also require us to acquire pollution abatement or remediation equipment modify our product designs or incur other expenses associated with such laws and regulations many new materials that we are evaluating for use in our operations may be subject to regulation under existing or future environmental laws and regulations that may restrict our use of one or more of such materials in our manufacturing assembly and test processes or products any of these restrictions could harm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter our manufacturing and assembly and test processes 

 

climate change poses both regulatory and physical risks that could harm our results of operations or affect the way we conduct our business 

in addition to the possible direct economic impact that climate change could have on us climate change mitigation programs and regulations can increase our costs for example the cost of perfluorocompounds pfcs a gas that we use in manufacturing could increase over time under some climatechangefocused emissions trading programs that may be imposed by government regulation if the use of pfcs is prohibited we would need to obtain substitute materials that may cost more or be less available for our manufacturing operations in addition air quality permit requirements for our manufacturing operations could become more burdensome and cause delays in our ability to modify or build additional manufacturing capacity under the recently adopted greenhouse gas regulations in the us many of our manufacturing facilities will become “major” sources under the clean air act in 2011 at a minimum this change in status will result in some uncertainty as the epa adopts guidance on implementation of its greenhouse gas regulations due to the dynamic nature of our semiconductor manufacturing operations it is likely these new regulations will result in increased costs for our us operations these cost increases could be associated with new air pollution control requirements and increased or new monitoring recordkeeping and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions we also see the potential for higher energy costs driven by climate change regulations our costs could increase if utility companies pass on their costs such as those associated with carbon taxes emission cap and trade programs or renewable portfolio standards while we maintain business recovery plans that are intended to allow us to recover from natural disasters or other events that can be disruptive to our business we cannot be sure that our plans will fully protect us from all such disasters or events many of our operations are located in semiarid regions such as israel and the southwestern us some scenarios predict that these regions may become even more vulnerable to prolonged droughts due to climate change 

 

changes in our effective tax rate may harm our results of operations 

a number of factors may increase our future effective tax rates including 

  

any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could reduce net income for future periods 

 

interest and other net could be impacted by macroeconomic and other factors harming our results of operations 

factors that could cause interest and other net in our consolidated statements of income to fluctuate include

overview 

 

our results of operations were as follows 

 

 

 

2010 was a record year for us strong market growth in the business and consumer pc market segments as well as the continued buildout of the data center the leadership of our product portfolio and improvements to our cost structure all contributed to the most profitable year in our history revenue increased 24 in 2010 compared to 2009 our 2010 gross margin percentage of 653 increased by 96 percentage points from 2009 primarily driven by lower factory underutilization charges higher microprocessor average selling prices lower platform microprocessor and chipset unit cost and higher platform unit sales we expect continued strength in emerging markets coupled with the buildout of the cloud computing infrastructure to contribute toward a 2011 revenue growth percentage in the mid to highteens this expectation is also inclusive of the recently completed acquisition of the wls business of infineon and the expected acquisition of mcafee in the first quarter of 2011 

 

in the fourth quarter we achieved record quarterly revenue for the third quarter in a row despite continuation of the softness we saw in the consumer segments of mature markets starting in the middle of the year the sequential decrease in our fourth quarter gross margin percentage was primarily driven by charges to repair and replace materials and systems impacted by a design issue related to our intel ® 6 series express chipset family see “note 20 chipset design issue” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k increased costs associated with taking older technology offline and higher startup costs these impacts were partially offset by the qualification for sale of our 2nd generation intel ® core tm processor products formerly codenamed sandy bridge resulting in lower microprocessor inventory writeoffs and sales of previously writtenoff products and higher platform average selling prices 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

as we enter 2011 the strength of our product portfolio is highlighted with the launch of 32nm process technology products based on our 2nd generation intel core processor microarchitecture we continue to deliver improvements in our product offerings through our “ticktock” technology development cadence we plan to invest 90 billion in capital assets in 2011 as we build and equip our 22nm process technology manufacturing capacity which will increase our leadingedge facilities to four this increase in capital spending will enable us to take advantage of the significant market growth opportunities that we believe exist for our products across the computing spectrum as well as move more transistors to our leadingedge process technologies 

 

the cashgenerating power of our business was evident in 2010 with 167 billion of cash from operations from a financial condition perspective we ended 2010 with an investment portfolio of 215 billion consisting of cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and marketable debt instruments included in trading assets during 2010 we purchased 52 billion in capital assets returned 35 billion to stockholders through dividends and repurchased 15 billion of common stock through our common stock repurchase program in january 2011 our board of directors declared a dividend of 01812 per common share for the first quarter of 2011 an increase of approximately 15 compared to our fourth quarter dividend and increased the repurchase authorization limit of our common stock repurchase program by 10 billion 

 

during 2010 we announced a definitive agreement to acquire mcafee for approximately 768 billion and we expect to complete the acquisition in the first quarter of 2011 for further information see “note 15 acquisitions” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions 

 

in the first quarter of 2011 we completed the acquisition of the wls business of infineon total net cash consideration for the acquisition is estimated at 14 billion for further information see “note 15 acquisitions” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

 

in january 2011 we entered into a longterm patent crosslicense agreement with nvidia under the agreement we receive a license to all of nvidia’s patents while nvidia products are licensed to our patents subject to exclusions for x86 products certain chipsets and certain flash memory technology products the agreement also includes settlement of the existing litigation between the companies as well as broad mutual general releases we agreed to make payments to nvidia totaling 15 billion over six years for further information see “note 29 contingencies” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

 

strategy 

 

our goal is to be the preeminent computing solutions company that powers the worldwide digital economy we believe that the proliferation of the internet and cloud computing have driven fundamental changes in the computing industry we are transforming from a company with a primary focus on the design and manufacture of semiconductor chips for pcs and servers to a computing company that delivers complete solutions in the form of hardware and software platforms and supporting services the number and variety of devices connected to the internet is growing and computing is becoming an increasingly personal experience end users value consistency across devices that connect seamlessly and effortlessly to the internet and to each other we will help to enable this experience by innovating around three pillars of computing energyefficient performance connectivity and security

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

to succeed in the changing computing environment we have the following key objectives 

  

we will use our core assets to meet these objectives our core assets include our silicon and process technology our architecture and platforms our global presence our strong relationships across the industry and our brand recognition we believe that applying these core assets to our key focus areas provides us with the scale capacity and global reach to establish new technologies and respond to customers’ needs quickly some of our core assets and key focus areas are 

  

our continued investment in developing our assets and execution on key focus areas will strengthen our competitive position as we enter and expand into new market segments we believe that these new market segments will result in demand that is incremental to that of microprocessors designed for notebook and desktop computers we also believe that increased internet traffic and use of cloud computing create a need for greater server infrastructure including server products optimized for energyefficient performance and virtualization 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

strategy by major market segment 

 

the strategy for our pc client group operating segment is to offer products that are incorporated into notebook netbook tablet and desktop computers for consumers and businesses 

 

  

the strategy for our data center group operating segment is to offer products that provide leading performance energy efficiency and virtualization technology for server workstation and storage platforms we are also increasing our focus on products designed for highperformance and missioncritical computing cloud computing services and emerging markets in addition we offer wired connectivity devices that are incorporated into products that make up the infrastructure for the internet 

 

the strategies for our other intel architecture operating segments include 

  

critical accounting estimates 

 

the methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our consolidated financial statements some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain our most critical accounting estimates include 

  

below we discuss these policies further as well as the estimates and judgments involved 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

nonmarketable equity investments 

 

we regularly invest in nonmarketable equity instruments of private companies which range from earlystage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models the carrying value of our nonmarketable equity investment portfolio excluding equity derivatives totaled 26 billion as of december 25 2010 34 billion as of december 26 2009 the majority of this balance as of december 25 2010 was concentrated in companies in the flash memory market segment our flash memory market segment investments include our investment in im flash technologies llc imft and im flash singapore llp imfs of 15 billion 16 billion as of december 26 2009 for additional information see “note 11 equity method and cost method investments” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

 

our nonmarketable equity investments are recorded using the cost method or the equity method of accounting depending on the facts and circumstances of each investment our nonmarketable equity investments are classified within other longterm assets on the consolidated balance sheets 

 

nonmarketable equity investments are inherently risky and their success is dependent on product development market acceptance operational efficiency other key business factors and the ability of the investee companies to raise additional funds in financial markets that can be volatile the companies could fail or not be able to raise additional funds when needed or they may receive lower valuations with less favorable investment terms than previous financings these events could cause our investments to become impaired in addition financial market volatility could negatively affect our ability to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings mergers and private sales for further information about our investment portfolio risks see “risk factors” in part i item 1a of this form 10k 

 

we determine the fair value of our nonmarketable equity investments quarterly for disclosure purposes however the investments are recorded at fair value only if an impairment charge is recognized we determine the fair value of our nonmarketable equity investments using the market and income approaches the market approach includes the use of financial metrics and ratios of comparable public companies such as projected revenues earnings and comparable performance multiples the selection of comparable companies requires management judgment and is based on a number of factors including comparable companies’ sizes growth rates industries development stages and other relevant factors the income approach includes the use of a discounted cash flow model which may include one or multiple discounted cash flow scenarios and requires the following significant estimates for the investee revenue based on assumed market segment size and assumed market segment share expenses capital spending and other costs and discount rates based on the risk profile of comparable companies estimates of market segment size market segment share expenses capital spending and other costs are developed by the investee andor intel using historical data and available market data the valuation of our nonmarketable equity investments also takes into account variables such as conditions reflected in the capital markets recent financing activities by the investees the investees’ capital structure and the terms of the investees’ issued interests 

 

for nonmarketable equity investments the measurement of fair value requires significant judgment and includes quantitative and qualitative analysis of identified events or circumstances that impact the fair value of the investment such as 

  

if the fair value of an investment is below our carrying value we determine if the investment is other than temporarily impaired based on our quantitative and qualitative analysis which includes assessing the severity and duration of the impairment and the likelihood of recovery before disposal if the investment is considered to be other than temporarily impaired we write down the investment to its fair value impairments of nonmarketable equity investments were 125 million in 2010 over the past 12 quarters including the fourth quarter of 2010 impairments of nonmarketable equity investments ranged from 11 million to 896 million per quarter this range included impairments of 896 million during the fourth quarter of 2008 primarily related to a 762 million impairment charge on our investment in clearwire communications llc clearwire llc 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

imftimfs 

 

imft and imfs are variable interest entities that are designed to manufacture and sell nand products to intel and micron at manufacturing cost we determine the fair value of our investment in imftimfs using the income approach based on a weighted average of multiple discounted cash flow scenarios of our nand solutions group business which requires the use of unobservable inputs unobservable inputs that require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments are the estimates for projected revenue and discount rate changes in management estimates for these unobservable inputs have the most significant effect on the fair value determination we have not had an otherthantemporary impairment of our investment in imftimfs 

 

longlived assets 

 

we assess the impairment of longlived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant underperformance of a business or product line in relation to expectations significant negative industry or economic trends and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets we measure the recoverability of assets that will continue to be used in our operations by comparing the carrying value of the asset grouping to our estimate of the related total future undiscounted net cash flows if an asset grouping’s carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows the asset grouping is considered to be impaired the impairment is measured by comparing the difference between the asset grouping’s carrying value and its fair value longlived assets such as goodwill intangible assets and property plant and equipment are considered nonfinancial assets and are recorded at fair value only if an impairment charge is recognized 

 

impairments of longlived assets are determined for groups of assets related to the lowest level of identifiable independent cash flows due to our asset usage model and the interchangeable nature of our semiconductor manufacturing capacity we must make subjective judgments in determining the independent cash flows that can be related to specific asset groupings in addition as we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions we must make subjective judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets primarily processspecific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements when we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated we accelerate the rate of depreciation over the assets’ new shorter useful lives over the past 12 quarters including the fourth quarter of 2010 impairments and accelerated depreciation of longlived assets ranged from 10 million to 300 million per quarter 

 

income taxes 

 

we must make estimates and judgments in determining the provision for taxes for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes as well as the interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions significant changes in these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 

 

we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets if recovery is not likely we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable we believe that we will ultimately recover the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets however should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely recovery of a portion of our deferred tax assets is impacted by management’s plans with respect to holding or disposing of certain investments therefore changes in management’s plans with respect to holding or disposing of investments could affect our future provision for taxes 

 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a twostep process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any if we determine that a tax position will more likely than not be sustained on audit the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors such as changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law new audit activity and effectively settled issues determining whether an uncertain tax position is effectively settled requires judgment such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

inventory 

 

the valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality the determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products the estimate of future demand is compared to workinprocess and finished goods inventory levels to determine the amount if any of obsolete or excess inventory as of december 25 2010 we had total workinprocess inventory of 19 billion and total finished goods inventory of 14 billion the demand forecast is included in the development of our shortterm manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuation and build decisions productspecific facts and circumstances reviewed in the inventory valuation process include a review of the customer base the stage of the product life cycle of our products consumer confidence and customer acceptance of our products as well as an assessment of the selling price in relation to the product cost if our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly we could be required to write off inventory which would negatively impact our gross margin 

 

in order to determine what costs can be included in the valuation of inventory we must determine normal capacity at our manufacturing and assembly and test facilities based on historical loadings compared to total available capacity if the factory loadings are below the established normal capacity level a portion of our manufacturing overhead costs would not be included in the cost of inventory and therefore would be recognized as cost of sales in that period which would negatively impact our gross margin we refer to these costs as excess capacity charges over the past 12 quarters excess capacity charges ranged from zero to 680 million per quarter 

 

loss contingencies 

 

we are subject to various legal and administrative proceedings and asserted and potential claims accruals related to repair or replacement of parts in connection with product errata as well as product warranties and potential asset impairments loss contingencies that arise in the ordinary course of business an estimated loss from such contingencies is recognized as a charge to income if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated disclosure of a loss contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred the outcomes of legal and administrative proceedings and claims and the estimation of product warranties and asset impairments are subject to significant uncertainty significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether a loss is reasonably estimable with respect to estimating the losses associated with repairing and replacing parts in connection with product errata we make judgments with respect to customer return rates costs to repair or replace parts and where the product is in our customer’s manufacturing process at least quarterly we review the status of each significant matter and we may revise our estimates these revisions could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 

 

accounting changes and recent accounting standards

results of operations 

 

the following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of income data as a percentage of net revenue for the periods indicated 

 

 

 

geographic breakdown of revenue 

 

 

our net revenue for 2010 increased 85 billion or 24 compared to 2009 the increase was due to higher microprocessor and chipset unit sales as well as higher microprocessor average selling prices revenue in the japan asiapacific americas and europe regions increased by 31 29 21 and 6 respectively compared to 2009 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

our overall gross margin dollars for 2010 increased 89 billion or 46 compared to 2009 the increase was primarily due to significantly higher revenue to a lesser extent excess capacity charges recorded in 2009 of 11 billion and lower platform microprocessor and chipset unit cost contributed to the increase in gross margin dollars for 2010 compared to 2009 these increases were partially offset by charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2010 to repair and replace materials and systems impacted by a design issue related to our intel ® 6 series express chipset family for further information see “note 20 chipset design issue” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

 

our overall gross margin percentage increased to 653 in 2010 from 557 in 2009 the increase in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to the gross margin percentage increase in the pc client group operating segment and to a lesser extent gross margin percentage increases in the data center group and nand solutions group operating segments we derived a substantial majority of our overall gross margin dollars in 2010 and 2009 from the sale of microprocessors in the pc client group and data center group operating segments see “business outlook” for a discussion of gross margin expectations 

 

our net revenue for 2009 decreased 7 compared to 2008 average selling prices for microprocessors and chipsets decreased and microprocessor and chipset unit sales increased compared to 2008 primarily due to the ramp of intel atom processors and chipsets which generally have lower average selling prices than our other microprocessor and chipset products revenue from the sale of nor flash memory products and communications products declined 740 million primarily as a result of business divestitures additionally an increase in revenue from the sale of nand flash memory products was mostly offset by a decrease in revenue from the sale of wireless connectivity products revenue in the asiapacific region increased 2 compared to 2008 while revenue in the europe japan and americas regions decreased by 26 15 and 4 respectively compared to 2008 

 

our overall gross margin dollars for 2009 decreased 13 billion or 6 compared to 2008 the decrease was due to lower revenue approximately 830 million of higher factory underutilization charges and approximately 330 million of higher startup costs these decreases were partially offset by lower platform unit cost and lower nand flash memory unit cost our overall gross margin percentage increased slightly to 557 in 2009 from 555 in 2008 the slight increase in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to the gross margin percentage increases in the nand solutions group and data center group operating segments offset by the gross margin percentage decrease in the pc client group operating segment we derived a substantial majority of our overall gross margin dollars in 2009 and most of our overall gross margin dollars in 2008 from the sales of microprocessors in the pc client group and data center group operating segments 

 

pc client group 

 

the revenue and operating income for the pc client group pccg for the three years ended december 25 2010 were as follows 

 

 

 

net revenue for the pccg operating segment increased by 54 billion or 21 in 2010 compared to 2009 microprocessors and chipsets within pccg include those designed for the notebook netbook and desktop computing market segments significantly higher notebook unit sales were the primary driver for the increase in microprocessor revenue to a lesser extent higher notebook average selling prices and higher desktop unit sales also contributed to the increase the increase in chipset motherboard and other revenue was due to significantly higher chipset unit sales partially offset by significantly lower revenue from the sale of wireless connectivity products 

 

operating income increased by 57 billion in 2010 compared to 2009 the increase in operating income was primarily due to significantly higher revenue during 2009 pccg recognized approximately 10 billion of excess capacity charges primarily related to microprocessors and chipsets additionally lower platform unit cost in 2010 contributed to the increase in operating income these impacts were partially offset by charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2010 to repair and replace materials and systems impacted by a design issue related to our intel ® 6 series express chipset family additionally operating expenses in 2010 were higher compared to 2009 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

for 2009 net revenue for the pccg operating segment decreased by 18 billion or 6 compared to 2008 the decrease in microprocessor revenue was primarily due to lower notebook microprocessor average selling prices and lower desktop microprocessor unit sales and average selling prices these decreases were partially offset by a significant increase in netbook microprocessor unit sales due to the ramp of intel atom processors the decrease in chipset motherboard and other revenue was primarily due to lower chipset average selling prices and lower unit sales of wireless connectivity products partially offset by higher chipset unit sales 

 

operating income decreased by 18 billion or 19 in 2009 compared to 2008 the decrease was primarily due to lower revenue and approximately 810 million of higher factory underutilization charges partially offset by lower platform unit cost 

 

data center group 

 

the revenue and operating income for the data center group dcg for the three years ended december 25 2010 were as follows 

 

 

 

net revenue for the dcg operating segment increased by 22 billion or 35 in 2010 compared to 2009 the increase in microprocessor revenue was primarily due to significantly higher microprocessor unit sales and to a lesser extent higher microprocessor average selling prices the increase in chipset motherboard and other revenue was due to significantly higher chipset unit sales and significantly higher revenue from the sale of wired connectivity products 

 

operating income increased by 21 billion in 2010 compared to 2009 the increase in operating income was due to significantly higher revenue and to a lesser extent lower chipset unit cost 

 

for 2009 net revenue for the dcg operating segment decreased slightly by 140 million or 2 compared to 2008 the increase in microprocessor revenue was due to higher microprocessor average selling prices partially offset by lower microprocessor unit sales the decrease in chipset motherboard and other revenue was primarily due to lower chipset average selling prices 

 

operating income increased by 164 million or 8 compared to 2008 the increase in operating income was primarily due to higher microprocessor revenue and lower operating expenses partially offset by approximately 150 million of higher startup costs as well as lower chipset revenue 

 

other intel architecture operating segments 

 

the revenue and operating income for the other intel architecture other ia operating segments including the embedded and communications group ecg the digital home group and the ultramobility group for the three years ended december 25 2010 were as follows 

 

 

 

net revenue for the other ia operating segments increased by 382 million or 27 in 2010 compared to 2009 the increase was primarily due to significantly higher revenue within ecg from significantly higher microprocessor and chipset unit sales operating loss decreased by 119 million in 2010 compared to 2009 the operating loss decrease was primarily due to significantly higher ecg revenue and lower ecg unit cost partially offset by higher operating expenses in ecg and the ultramobility group 

 

for 2009 net revenue for the other ia operating segments decreased by 361 million or 20 compared to 2008 and operating loss for the other ia operating segments increased by 116 million in 2009 compared to 2008 the changes were primarily due to lower revenue from the sale of communications products within ecg primarily as a result of business divestitures 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

operating expenses 

 

operating expenses for the three years ended december 25 2010 were as follows 

 

 

 

research and development rd spending increased by 923 million or 16 in 2010 compared to 2009 and was flat in 2009 compared to 2008 the increase in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to higher profitdependent compensation an increase in employees and higher process development costs as we transitioned from manufacturing startup costs related to our 32nm process technology to rd of our nextgeneration 22nm process technology in 2009 compared to 2008 we had lower process development costs as we transitioned from rd to manufacturing using our 32nm process technology this decrease was offset by higher profitdependent compensation 

 

marketing general and administrative marketing general and administrative expenses decreased 16 billion or 20 in 2010 compared to 2009 and increased 25 billion or 45 in 2009 compared to 2008 the decrease in 2010 was due to the 2009 charge of 1447 billion incurred as a result of the fine imposed by the european commission ec and the 125 billion payment to amd in 2009 as part of a settlement agreement these decreases were partially offset by higher advertising expenses including cooperative advertising expenses higher profitdependent compensation and to a lesser extent expenses related to our wind river software group operating segment and an expense of 100 million recognized during the fourth quarter of 2010 due to a patent crosslicense agreement that we entered into with nvidia in january 2011 see “note 29 contingencies” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k the increase in 2009 compared to 2008 was due to the 2009 charge incurred as a result of the fine imposed by the ec and the payment to amd in 2009 as part of a settlement agreement to a lesser extent we had higher profitdependent compensation expenses that were partially offset by lower advertising expenses including cooperative advertising expenses 

 

rd combined with marketing general and administrative expenses were 30 of net revenue in 2010 39 of net revenue in 2009 and 30 of net revenue in 2008 

 

restructuring and asset impairment charges the following table summarizes restructuring and asset impairment charges by plan for the three years ended december 25 2010 

 

 

 

2009 restructuring program 

 

in the first quarter of 2009 management approved plans to restructure some of our manufacturing and assembly and test operations these plans included closing two assembly and test facilities in malaysia one facility in the philippines and one facility in china stopping production at a 200mm wafer fabrication facility in oregon and ending production at our 200mm wafer fabrication facility in california the 2009 restructuring program is complete the following table summarizes charges for the 2009 restructuring program for the two years ended december 25 2010 

 

 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

the following table summarizes the restructuring and asset impairment activity for the 2009 restructuring program during 2009 and 2010 

 

 

 

under the 2009 restructuring program we incurred 208 million of charges related to employee severance and benefit arrangements for approximately 6500 employees most of these employee actions occurred within manufacturing 

 

we estimate that these employee severance and benefit charges result in gross annual savings of approximately 290 million we are realizing a substantial majority of these savings within cost of sales 

 

2008 nand plan 

 

in the fourth quarter of 2008 management approved a plan with micron to discontinue the supply of nand flash memory from the 200mm facility within the imft manufacturing network the agreement resulted in a 215 million restructuring charge primarily related to the imft 200mm supply agreement the restructuring charge resulted in a reduction of our investment in imftimfs of 184 million a cash payment to micron of 24 million and other cash payments of 7 million the 2008 nand plan was completed at the end of 2008 

 

2006 efficiency program 

 

in the third quarter of 2006 management approved several actions as part of a restructuring plan designed to improve operational efficiency and financial results the following table summarizes charges for the 2006 efficiency program for the three years ended december 25 2010 

 

 

 

during 2006 as part of our assessment of our worldwide manufacturing capacity operations we placed for sale our fabrication facility in colorado springs colorado as a result of placing the facility for sale in 2006 we recorded a 214 million impairment charge to write down to fair value the land building and equipment we incurred 54 million in additional asset impairment charges as a result of market conditions related to the colorado springs facility during 2007 and additional charges in 2008 we sold the colorado springs facility in 2009 

 

we incurred 85 million in asset impairment charges related to assets that we sold in conjunction with the divestiture of our nor flash memory business in 2007 and an additional 275 million in 2008 we determined the impairment charges based on the fair value less selling costs that we expected to receive upon completion of the divestiture in 2007 and determined the impairment charges based on the revised fair value of the equity and note receivable that we received upon completion of the divestiture less selling costs in 2008 for further information on this divestiture see “note 16 divestitures” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

the following table summarizes the restructuring and asset impairment activity for the 2006 efficiency program during 2009 

 

 

 

the 2006 efficiency program is complete from the third quarter of 2006 through 2009 we incurred a total of 16 billion in restructuring and asset impairment charges related to this program these charges included a total of 686 million related to employee severance and benefit arrangements for 11300 employees a substantial majority of these employee actions affected employees within manufacturing information technology and marketing the restructuring and asset impairment charges also included 896 million in asset impairment charges

sharebased compensation totaled 917 million in 2010 889 million in 2009 and 851 million in 2008 sharebased compensation was included in cost of sales and operating expenses 

 

as of december 25 2010 unrecognized sharebased compensation costs and the weighted average periods over which the costs are expected to be recognized were as follows 

 

 

 

gains losses on equity method investments net 

 

gains losses on equity method investments net were as follows 

 

 

 

we recognized higher gains on sales lower impairment charges and lower equity method losses in 2010 compared to 2009 during 2010 we recognized a gain of 33 million on the initial public offering of smart technologies inc included within “equity method losses net” and a gain of 148 million on the subsequent sale of our shares in the secondary offering included in “other net” resulting in a total gain of 181 million we also recognized a gain of 91 million on the sale of our ownership interest in numonyx bv included in “other net” equity method losses net also includes clearwire llc 116 million loss in 2010 and 27 million loss in 2009 numonyx 42 million gain in 2010 31 million loss in 2009 and 87 million loss in 2008 and clearwire corporation 184 million loss in 2008 for further information see “note 11 equity method and cost method investments” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

impairment charges in 2008 included a 762 million impairment charge recognized on our investment in clearwire llc and a 250 million impairment charge recognized on our investment in numonyx we recognized the impairment charge on our investment in clearwire llc to write down our investment to its fair value primarily due to the fair value being significantly lower than the cost basis of our investment in the fourth quarter of 2008 the impairment charge on our investment in numonyx was due to a general decline in 2008 in the nor flash memory market segment see “note 11 equity method and cost method investments” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

 

gains losses on other equity investments net 

 

gains losses on other equity investments net were as follows 

 

 

 

we recognized higher gains on thirdparty merger transactions primarily related to our cost method investments higher gains on sales and lower impairment charges in 2010 compared to 2009 gains on other equity investments in 2010 included a gain of 67 million on the sale of shares in micron which occurred in the first quarter of 2010 

 

impairment charges in 2008 included a 176 million impairment charge recognized on our investment in clearwire corporation and 97 million of impairment charges on our investment in micron the impairment charge on our investment in clearwire corporation was due to the fair value being significantly lower than the cost basis of our investment at the end of the fourth quarter of 2008 the impairment charges on our investment in micron reflected the difference between our cost basis and the fair value of our investment in micron at the end of the second and third quarters of 2008 in addition we recognized higher gains on equity derivatives in 2009 compared to 2008 

 

interest and other net 

 

the components of interest and other net were as follows 

 

 

 

interest income was lower in 2010 compared to 2009 as a result of lower average interest rates partially offset by higher average investment balances the average interest rate earned during 2010 decreased by approximately 05 percentage points compared to 2009 in addition lower fair value gains on our trading assets zero in 2010 and 70 million in 2009 were partially offset by lower exchange rate losses zero in 2010 and 40 million in 2009 exchange rate losses in 2009 were due to euro exposure related to our eurodenominated liability for the ec fine 

 

we recognized lower interest income in 2009 compared to 2008 as a result of lower interest rates the average interest rate earned during 2009 decreased by 24 percentage points compared to 2008 in addition lower gains on divestitures zero in 2009 and 59 million in 2008 were more than offset by 70 million of fair value gains in 2009 on our trading assets compared to 130 million of fair value losses in 2008 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

provision for taxes 

 

our provision for taxes and effective tax rate were as follows 

 

 

 

we generated a higher percentage of our profits from higher tax jurisdictions in 2010 compared to 2009 negatively impacting our effective tax rate for 2010 the effective tax rate for 2009 was positively impacted by the reversal of previously accrued taxes of 366 million on settlements effective settlements and related remeasurements of various uncertain tax positions these impacts were partially offset by the recognition of the ec fine of 1447 billion in 2009 which was not tax deductible and therefore significantly increased our effective tax rate for 2009 for further information on the ec fine see “note 29 contingencies” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

 

we generated a higher percentage of our profits from lower tax jurisdictions in 2009 compared to 2008 positively impacting our effective tax rate for 2009 in addition the 2009 tax rate was positively impacted by the reversal of previously accrued taxes of 366 million on settlements effective settlements and related remeasurements of various uncertain tax positions compared to a reversal of 103 million for such matters in 2008 these impacts were partially offset by the recognition of the ec fine in addition our 2008 effective tax rate was negatively impacted by the recognition of a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of realizing tax benefits related to impairments of our equity investments 

 

business outlook 

 

our future results of operations and the topics of other forwardlooking statements contained in this form 10k including this mda involve a number of risks and uncertainties—in particular 

 

  

 

our business outlook incorporates financial projections and assumptions concerning the performance of mcafee which we expect to acquire in the first quarter of 2011 and the recently acquired wls business of infineon see “note 15 acquisitions” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k because we are required to make a number of assumptions about the future performance of these businesses it may be more difficult to accurately project our financial results some of these assumptions include the prospects for the acquired businesses’ products and markets the ability to retain customer relationships and key employees successful integration of key technologies or operations and the potential for unexpected liabilities in addition as we integrate these businesses into our operations our understanding of the financial and operational performance of the acquired businesses may change which could require an update to our business outlook 

 

our business outlook contains forwardlooking statements and projections based upon estimates of the impact of the chipset design issue related to our intel 6 series express chipset family see “note 20 chipset design issue” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k on our future financial and operating results including on revenue gross margin and inventory valuation based on our preliminary analysis among the factors related to the chipset design issue that could cause actual results to differ are the number of units that may be affected the impact on systems in the market the costs that we may incur in repairing or replacing impacted components the extent to which customers purchase parts from our competitors as a result of our parts shortages or otherwise the extent of shipments of impacted chipsets for use in pc system configurations that would not be impacted by the design issue and the extent to which we are able to increase production of substitute or redesigned parts for customers 

 

in addition to the various important factors discussed above a number of other important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations see “risk factors” in part i item 1a of this form 10k 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

our expectations for 2011 are as follows 

  

status of business outlook 

 

we expect that our corporate representatives will from time to time meet privately with investors investment analysts the media and others and may reiterate the forwardlooking statements contained in the “business outlook” section and elsewhere in this form 10k including any such statements that are incorporated by reference in this form 10k at the same time we will keep this form 10k and our most current business outlook publicly available on our investor relations web site at wwwintccom  the public can continue to rely on the business outlook published on our web site as representing our current expectations on matters covered unless we publish a notice stating otherwise the statements in the “business outlook” section and other forwardlooking statements in this form 10k are subject to revision during the course of the year in our quarterly earnings releases and sec filings and at other times 

 

from the close of business on march 4 2011 until our quarterly earnings release is published presently scheduled for april 19 2011 we will observe a “quiet period” during the quiet period the “business outlook” section and other forwardlooking statements first published in our form 8k filed on january 13 2011 as updated in our form 8k filed on january 31 2011 and as reiterated or updated as applicable in this form 10k should be considered historical speaking as of prior to the quiet period only and not subject to update during the quiet period our representatives will not comment on our business outlook or our financial results or expectations the exact timing and duration of the routine quiet period and any others that we utilize from time to time may vary at our discretion 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

 

 

 

sources and uses of cash in millions 

 

 

in summary our cash flows were as follows 

 

 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

operating activities 

 

cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain noncash items and changes in certain assets and liabilities 

 

for 2010 compared to 2009 the 55 billion increase in cash provided by operating activities was due to higher net income partially offset by adjustments for noncash items income taxes paid net of refunds in 2010 compared to 2009 were 37 billion higher primarily due to higher income before taxes in 2010 

 

changes in assets and liabilities as of december 25 2010 compared to december 26 2009 included the following 

  

for 2010 and 2009 our two largest customers accounted for 38 of our net revenue with one of these customers accounting for 21 of our net revenue in 2010 and 2009 and another customer accounting for 17 of our net revenue in 2010 and 2009 these two largest customers accounted for 44 of our accounts receivable as of december 25 2010 41 as of december 26 2009 

 

for 2009 compared to 2008 the 244 million increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to changes in assets and liabilities partially offset by lower net income income taxes paid net of refunds in 2009 compared to 2008 were 31 billion lower primarily due to lower income before taxes and timing of payments 

 

investing activities 

 

investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures net investment purchases maturities disposals and cash used for acquisitions 

 

the increase in cash used for investing activities in 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to an increase in net purchases of availableforsale investments and to a lesser extent higher capital expenditures 52 billion in 2010 and 45 billion in 2009 these increases were partially offset by a decrease in net purchases of trading assets and lower cash paid for acquisitions 

 

the increase in cash used for investing activities in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily due to an increase in net purchases of availableforsale investments and trading assets and higher cash paid for acquisitions these increases were partially offset by a decrease in investments in nonmarketable equity investments our investments in nonmarketable equity investments in 2008 included 10 billion for an ownership interest in clearwire llc 

 

financing activities 

 

financing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases of common stock payment of dividends to stockholders issuance and repayment of longterm debt and proceeds from the sale of shares through employee equity incentive plans 

 

the increase in cash used in financing activities in 2010 compared to 2009 was due to the issuance of longterm debt in 2009 during 2010 we repurchased 17 billion of common stock compared to 18 billion in 2009 as of december 25 2010 42 billion remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization of 25 billion in january 2011 our board of directors increased the repurchase authorization limit by 10 billion we base our level of common stock repurchases on internal cash management decisions and this level may fluctuate proceeds from the sale of shares through employee equity incentive plans totaled 587 million in 2010 compared to 400 million in 2009 our total dividend payments were 35 billion in 2010 compared to 31 billion in 2009 as a result of an increase in quarterly cash dividends per common share we have paid a cash dividend in each of the past 73 quarters in january 2011 our board of directors declared a cash dividend of 01812 per common share for the first quarter of 2011 the dividend is payable on march 1 2011 to stockholders of record on february 7 2011 

 

the decrease in cash used in financing activities in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily due to a decrease in repurchases of common stock and the issuance of longterm debt partially offset by lower proceeds from sales of shares through employee equity incentive plans we used the majority of the proceeds from the 2009 issuance of longterm debt to repurchase common stock 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

liquidity 

 

cash generated by operations is our primary source of liquidity as of december 25 2010 cash and cash equivalents marketable debt instruments included in trading assets and shortterm investments totaled 215 billion in addition to the 215 billion we have 39 billion in loans receivable and other longterm investments that we include when assessing our investment portfolio in the first quarter of 2011 we completed the acquisition of the wls business of infineon total net cash consideration for the acquisition is estimated at 14 billion for further information see “note 15 acquisitions” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

 

substantially all of our investments in debt instruments are with aa2 or better rated issuers and a substantial majority of the issuers are rated aaaa3 or better 

 

our commercial paper program provides another potential source of liquidity we have an ongoing authorization from our board of directors to borrow up to 30 billion including through the issuance of commercial paper maximum borrowings under our commercial paper program during 2010 were 150 million although no commercial paper remained outstanding as of december 25 2010 our commercial paper was rated a1 by standard  poor’s and p1 by moody’s as of december 25 2010 we also have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the sec pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt equity and other securities 

 

we believe that we have the financial resources needed to meet our business requirements for the next 12 months including capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test working capital requirements and potential dividends common stock repurchases and acquisitions or strategic investments 

 

fair value of financial instruments 

 

when determining fair value we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and we consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability for further information see “fair value” in “note 2 accounting policies” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

 

credit risk is factored into the valuation of financial instruments that we measure and record at fair value on a recurring basis when fair value is determined using pricing models such as a discounted cash flow model the issuer’s credit risk andor intel’s credit risk is factored into the calculation of the fair value as appropriate 

 

marketable debt instruments 

 

as of december 25 2010 our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included 24 billion of marketable debt instruments of these instruments 7 billion was classified as level 1 167 billion as level 2 and 308 million as level 3 

 

our balance of marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 1 was classified as such due to the use of observable market prices for identical securities that are traded in active markets management judgment was required to determine the levels for the frequency of transactions that should be met for a market to be considered active our assessment of an active market for our marketable debt instruments generally takes into consideration the number of days each individual instrument trades over a specified period 

 

of the 167 billion balance of marketable debt instruments measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 2 approximately 45 of the balance was classified as level 2 due to the use of a discounted cash flow model and approximately 55 due to the use of nonbinding market consensus prices that are corroborated with observable market data 

 

our marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 3 were classified as such due to the lack of observable market data to corroborate either the nonbinding market consensus prices or the nonbinding broker quotes when observable market data is not available we corroborate the nonbinding market consensus prices and nonbinding broker quotes using unobservable data if available 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

equity securities 

 

as of december 25 2010 our portfolio of assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included 14 billion of marketable equity securities of these securities 12 billion was classified as level 1 because the valuations were based on quoted prices for identical securities in active markets our assessment of an active market for our marketable equity securities generally takes into consideration the number of days that each individual equity security trades over a specified period the remaining marketable equity securities of 223 million were classified as level 2 because their valuations were either adjusted for securityspecific restrictions or based on quoted prices for identical securities in less active markets 

 

contractual obligations 

 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of december 25 2010 

 

 

 

 

  

contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services include agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on intel and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction for obligations with cancellation provisions the amounts included in the preceding table were limited to the noncancelable portion of the agreement terms andor the minimum cancellation fee 

 

we have entered into certain agreements for the purchase of raw materials that specify minimum prices and quantities based on a percentage of the total available market or based on a percentage of our future purchasing requirements due to the uncertainty of the future market and our future purchasing requirements as well as the nonbinding nature of these agreements obligations under these agreements are not included in the preceding table our purchase orders for other products are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons in addition some of our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

contractual obligations that are contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones are not included in the preceding table these obligations include contingent fundingpayment obligations and milestonebased equity investment funding these arrangements are not considered contractual obligations until the milestone is met by the third party assuming that all future milestones are met additional required payments related to these obligations were not significant as of december 25 2010 

 

for the majority of restricted stock units granted the number of shares issued on the date the restricted stock units vest is net of the minimum statutory withholding requirements that we pay in cash to the appropriate taxing authorities on behalf of our employees the obligation to pay the relative taxing authority is not included in the preceding table as the amount is contingent upon continued employment in addition the amount of the obligation is unknown as it is based in part on the market price of our common stock when the awards vest 

 

we have a contractual obligation to purchase the output of imft in proportion to our investment which was 49 as of december 25 2010 we also have several agreements with micron related to intellectual property rights and rd funding related to nand flash manufacturing the obligation to purchase our proportion of imft’s inventory was approximately 100 million as of december 25 2010 see “note 11 equity method and cost method investments” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

 

in january 2011 we entered into a patent crosslicense agreement with nvidia we agreed to make payments totaling 15 billion to nvidia over six years 300 million in each of january 2011 2012 and 2013 and 200 million in each of january 2014 2015 and 2016 for further information see “note 29 contingencies” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

 

during 2010 we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all outstanding common shares of mcafee for 4800 per share in cash to be paid to the stockholders of mcafee as of the date that we entered into the agreement the transaction had an approximate value of 768 billion we expect to complete the acquisition in the first quarter of 2011 the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions for further information see “note 15 acquisitions” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

 

during 2010 we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the wls business of infineon in the first quarter of 2011 we completed the acquisition total net cash consideration for the acquisition is estimated at 14 billion for further information see “note 15 acquisitions” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

 

the expected timing of payments of the obligations above is estimated based on current information timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations 

 

offbalancesheet arrangements 

 

as of december 25 2010 we did not have any significant offbalancesheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk 

tablestart 


 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

we use derivative financial instruments primarily to manage currency exchange rate and interest rate risk and to a lesser extent equity market and commodity price risk all of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial positions as of december 25 2010 and december 26 2009 actual results may differ materially 

 

currency exchange rates 

 

in general we economically hedge currency risks of nonusdollardenominated investments in debt instruments and loans receivable with offsetting currency forward contracts or currency interest rate swaps gains and losses on these nonuscurrency investments would generally be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments resulting in a negligible net exposure to loss 

 

substantially all of our revenue is transacted in us dollars however a significant amount of our operating expenditures and capital purchases are incurred in or exposed to other currencies primarily the japanese yen the euro and the israeli shekel we have established balance sheet and forecasted transaction currency risk management programs to protect against fluctuations in fair value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in exchange rates we generally utilize currency forward contracts and to a lesser extent currency options in these hedging programs our hedging programs reduce but do not always entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements see “risk factors” in part i item 1a of this form 10k we considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that a weighted average adverse change of 20 in currency exchange rates could be experienced in the near term such an adverse change after taking into account hedges and offsetting positions would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before taxes of less than 35 million as of december 25 2010 less than 40 million as of december 26 2009 

 

interest rates 

 

we generally hedge interest rate risks of fixedrate debt instruments with offsetting interest rate swaps gains and losses on these investments would generally be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments resulting in a negligible net exposure to interest rate loss 

 

we are exposed to interest rate risk related to our investment portfolio and debt issuances we refer to our combined investment portfolio investment hedges and debt issuances as our net investment position the primary objective of our investments in debt instruments is to preserve principal while maximizing yields to achieve this objective the returns on our investments in debt instruments are generally based on the usdollar threemonth libor a hypothetical decrease in interest rates of 10 would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our debt issuances of approximately 235 million as of december 25 2010 an increase of approximately 205 million as of december 26 2009 a hypothetical decrease in interest rates of up to 10 after taking into account investment hedges would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our investment portfolio of up to approximately 15 million as of december 25 2010 an increase of approximately 10 million as of december 26 2009 these hypothetical decreases in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our net investment position of approximately 220 million as of december 25 2010 a decrease of 195 million as of december 26 2009 the fluctuations in fair value of our net investment position reflect only the direct impact of the change in interest rates other economic variables such as equity market fluctuations and changes in relative credit risk could result in a significantly higher decline in our net investment position for further information on how credit risk is factored into the valuation of our investment portfolio and debt issuances see “fair value of financial instruments” in part ii item 7 of this form 10k 

 

equity prices 

 

our marketable equity investments include marketable equity securities and equity derivative instruments such as warrants and options to the extent that our marketable equity securities have strategic value we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our equity market exposure through hedging activities however for our investments in strategic equity derivative instruments we may enter into transactions to reduce or eliminate the equity market risks for securities that we no longer consider strategic we evaluate legal market and economic factors in our decision on the timing of disposal and whether it is possible and appropriate to hedge the equity market risk 

 

we hold derivative instruments that seek to offset changes in liabilities related to the equity market risks of certain deferred compensation arrangements the gains and losses from changes in fair value of these derivatives are designed to offset the gains and losses on the related liabilities resulting in an insignificant net exposure to loss 

as of december 25 2010 the fair value of our marketable equity investments and our equity derivative instruments including hedging positions was 15 billion 805 million as of december 26 2009 our marketable equity investments include our investments in micron imagination technologies group plc vmware inc and clearwire corporation and were carried at a total fair market value of 968 million or 65 of our marketable equity portfolio as of december 25 2010 our marketable equity method investment in smart is excluded from our analysis as the carrying value does not fluctuate based on market price changes unless an otherthantemporary impairment is deemed necessary to determine reasonably possible decreases in the market value of our marketable equity investments we analyzed the expected market price sensitivity of our marketable equity investment portfolio assuming a loss of 40 in market prices and after reflecting the impact of hedges and offsetting positions the aggregate value of our marketable equity investments could decrease by approximately 365 million based on the value as of december 25 2010 a decrease in value of approximately 405 million based on the value as of december 26 2009 using an assumed loss of 50 

 

many of the same factors that could result in an adverse movement of equity market prices affect our nonmarketable equity investments although we cannot always quantify the impact directly financial markets are volatile which could negatively affect the prospects of the companies we invest in their ability to raise additional capital and the likelihood of our being able to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings mergers and private sales these types of investments involve a great deal of risk and there can be no assurance that any specific company will grow or become successful consequently we could lose all or part of our investment our nonmarketable equity investments excluding investments accounted for under the equity method had a carrying amount of 872 million as of december 25 2010 939 million as of december 26 2009 as of december 25 2010 the carrying amount of our nonmarketable equity method investments was 18 billion 25 billion as of december 26 2009 a substantial majority of this balance as of december 25 2010 was concentrated in our imftimfs investment of 15 billion 16 billion as of december 26 2009 our investments as of december 26 2009 also included an investment of 453 million in numonyx which was sold in 2010 for further information see “note 11 equity method and cost method investments” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k

inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

 

our management including the ceo and cfo does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures

manufacturing and assembly and test 

 

as of december 26 2009 64 of our wafer fabrication including microprocessors and chipsets was conducted within the us at our facilities in arizona oregon new mexico and massachusetts the remaining 36 of our wafer fabrication was conducted outside the us at our facilities in ireland and israel 

 

as of december 26 2009 we primarily manufactured our products in wafer fabrication facilities at the following locations 

 

 

 

in addition to our current facilities we are building a 300mm wafer fabrication facility in china that is expected to begin production on chipsets using our 65nm process technology in late 2010 or early 2011 

 

as of december 26 2009 the substantial majority of our microprocessors were manufactured on 300mm wafers using our 45nm process technology in the second half of 2009 we began manufacturing microprocessors using our 32nm process technology as we move to each succeeding generation of manufacturing process technology we incur significant startup costs to prepare each factory for manufacturing however continuing to advance our process technology provides benefits that we believe justify these costs the benefits of moving to each succeeding generation of manufacturing process technology can include using less space per transistor reducing heat output from each transistor andor increasing the number of integrated features on each chip these advancements can result in microprocessors that are higher performing consume less power andor cost less to manufacture 

 

we use thirdparty manufacturing companies foundries to manufacture wafers for certain components including networking and communications products in addition we primarily use subcontractors to manufacture boardlevel products and systems and purchase certain communications networking products from external vendors in the asiapacific region 

 

our nand flash memory products are manufactured by imft a nand flash memory manufacturing company that we formed with micron technology inc our nand flash memory products are manufactured by imft using 34nm or 50nm process technology and we expect to offer nand flash memory products using 25nm process technology during the second quarter of 2010 we purchase 49 of the manufactured output of imft as of december 26 2009 assembly and test of nand flash memory products is performed by micron and other external subcontractors see “note 11 nonmarketable equity investments” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

 

during 2008 we completed the divestiture of our nor flash memory business in exchange for an ownership interest in numonyx bv we are leasing a wafer fabrication facility located in israel to numonyx that facility is not shown in our above listing of wafer fabrication facilities 

following the manufacturing process the majority of our components are subject to assembly and test we perform our components assembly and test at facilities in malaysia china and costa rica we are building a new assembly and test facility in vietnam that is expected to begin production in the second half of 2010 to augment capacity we use subcontractors to perform assembly of certain products primarily chipsets and networking and communications products 

 

our employment practices are consistent with and we expect our suppliers and subcontractors to abide by local country law in addition we impose a minimum employee age requirement as well as progressive ehs requirements regardless of local law 

 

we have thousands of suppliers including subcontractors providing our various materials and service needs we set expectations for supplier performance and reinforce those expectations with periodic assessments we communicate those expectations to our suppliers regularly and work with them to implement improvements when necessary we seek where possible to have several sources of supply for all of these materials and resources but we may rely on a single or limited number of suppliers or upon suppliers in a single country in those cases we develop and implement plans and actions to reduce the exposure that would result from a disruption in supply we have entered into longterm contracts with certain suppliers to ensure a portion of our silicon supply 

 

our products are typically produced at multiple intel facilities at various sites around the world or by subcontractors who have multiple facilities however some products are produced in only one intel or subcontractor facility and we seek to implement actions and plans to reduce the exposure that would result from a disruption at any such facility see “risk factors” in part i item 1a of this form 10k 

 

research and development 

 

we are committed to investing in worldclass technology development particularly in the design and manufacture of integrated circuits research and development rd expenditures in 2009 were 57 billion 57 billion in 2008 and 58 billion in 2007 

 

our rd activities are directed toward developing the technology innovations that we believe will deliver our next generation of products and platforms which will in turn enable new form factors and new usage models for businesses and consumers our rd activities range from designing and developing products to developing and refining manufacturing processes to researching future technologies and products 

 

we are focusing our rd efforts on advanced computing technologies developing new microarchitectures advancing our silicon manufacturing process technology delivering the next generation of microprocessors and chipsets improving our platform initiatives and developing software solutions and tools to support our technologies our rd efforts enable new levels of performance and address areas such as energy efficiency scalability for multicore architectures system manageability and security and ease of use we continue to make significant rd investments in the development of socs to enable growth in areas such as handhelds including mids and smartphones embedded applications and consumer electronics in addition we continue to make significant investments in graphics and wireless technologies 

 

as part of our rd efforts we plan to introduce a new microarchitecture for our notebook desktop and intel xeon processors approximately every two years and ramp the next generation of silicon process technology in the intervening years we refer to this as our “ticktock” technology development cadence in 2009 we started manufacturing microprocessors using our new 32nm secondgeneration hik metal gate silicon process technology and we expect to introduce a new microarchitecture using our 32nm process technology in 2010 we are currently developing 22nm process technology our nextgeneration process technology and expect to begin manufacturing products using that technology in 2011 our leadership in silicon technology has enabled us to make “moore’s law” a reality moore’s law predicted that transistor density on integrated circuits would double about every two years our leadership in silicon technology has also helped expand on the advances anticipated by moore’s law by bringing new capabilities into silicon and producing new products and platforms optimized for a wider variety of applications 

 

our rd model is based on a global organization that emphasizes a collaborative approach to identifying and developing new technologies leading standards initiatives and influencing regulatory policies to accelerate the adoption of new technologies our rd initiatives are performed by various business groups within the company and we centrally manage key crossbusiness group product initiatives to align and prioritize our rd activities across these groups in addition we may augment our rd initiatives by investing in companies or entering into agreements with companies that have similar rd focus areas for example we have an agreement with micron for joint development of nand flash memory technologies 

employees 

 

as of december 26 2009 we had 79800 employees worldwide with 55 of those employees located in the us 

 

sales and marketing 

 

customers 

 

we sell our products primarily to original equipment manufacturers oems and original design manufacturers odms odms provide design andor manufacturing services to branded and unbranded privatelabel resellers in addition we sell our products to other manufacturers including makers of a wide range of industrial and communications equipment our customers also include pc and network communications products users who buy pc components and our other products through distributor reseller retail and oem channels throughout the world in certain instances we have entered into supply agreements to continue to manufacture and sell products of divested business lines to acquiring companies during certain transition periods 

 

our worldwide reseller sales channel consists of thousands of indirect customers systems builders that purchase intel microprocessors and other products from our distributors we have a boxed processor program that allows distributors to sell intel microprocessors in small quantities to these systemsbuilder customers boxed processors are also available in direct retail outlets 

 

in 2009 hewlettpackard company accounted for 21 of our net revenue 20 in 2008 and 17 in 2007 and dell inc accounted for 17 of our net revenue 18 in 2008 and 2007 no other customer accounted for more than 10 of our net revenue for information about revenue and operating income by operating segment and revenue from unaffiliated customers by geographic regioncountry see “results of operations” in part ii item 7 and “note 29 operating segment and geographic information” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

 

sales arrangements 

 

our products are sold or licensed through sales offices throughout the world sales of our products are typically made via purchase orders that contain standard terms and conditions covering matters such as pricing payment terms and warranties as well as indemnities for issues specific to our products such as patent and copyright indemnities from time to time we may enter into additional agreements with customers covering for example changes from our standard terms and conditions new product development and marketing privatelabel branding and other matters most of our sales are made using electronic and webbased processes that allow the customer to review inventory availability and track the progress of specific goods ordered pricing on particular products may vary based on volumes ordered and other factors we also offer discounts rebates and other incentives to customers to increase acceptance of our products and technology 

 

our products are typically shipped under terms that transfer title to the customer even in arrangements for which the recognition of revenue and related costs of sales is deferred our standard terms and conditions of sale typically provide that payment is due at a later date generally 30 days after shipment or delivery our credit department sets accounts receivable and shipping limits for individual customers to control credit risk to intel arising from outstanding account balances we assess credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis and from this analysis we establish credit limits and determine whether we will seek to use one or more credit support devices such as obtaining some form of thirdparty guaranty or standby letter of credit or obtaining credit insurance for all or a portion of the account balance if necessary credit losses may still be incurred due to bankruptcy fraud or other failure of the customer to pay for information about our allowance for doubtful receivables see “schedule ii—valuation and qualifying accounts” in part iv of this form 10k 

 

most of our sales to distributors are made under agreements allowing for price protection on unsold merchandise and a right of return on stipulated quantities of unsold merchandise under the price protection program we give distributors credits for the difference between the original price paid and the current price that we offer on most products there is no contractual limit on the amount of price protection nor is there a limit on the time horizon under which price protection is granted the right of return granted generally consists of a stock rotation program in which distributors are able to exchange certain products based on the number of qualified purchases made by the distributor although we have the option to grant credit for repair or replace defective products there is no contractual limit on the amount of credit granted to a distributor 

distribution 

 

typically distributors handle a wide variety of products including those that compete with our products and fill orders for many customers we also utilize thirdparty sales representatives who generally do not offer directly competitive products but may carry complementary items manufactured by others sales representatives do not maintain a product inventory instead their customers place orders directly with us or through distributors several distribution warehouses are located in close proximity to key customers 

 

backlog 

 

we do not believe that backlog as of any particular date is meaningful as our sales are made primarily pursuant to standard purchase orders for delivery of products only a small portion of our orders is noncancelable and the dollar amount associated with the noncancelable portion is not significant 

 

seasonal trends 

 

our microprocessor sales generally have followed a seasonal trend historically our sales have been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year consumer purchases of pcs have historically been higher in the second half of the year primarily due to backtoschool and holiday demand in addition purchases from businesses have also historically tended to be higher in the second half of the year 

 

marketing 

 

our corporate marketing objectives are to build a strong intel corporate brand that connects with consumers and have a limited number of meaningful and valuable brands in our portfolio to aid businesses and consumers in making informed choices and to make technology purchase decisions easier for them the intel core processor family and the intel atom intel pentium intel celeron intel xeon and intel itanium trademarks make up our processor brands 

 

we promote brand awareness and generate demand through our own direct marketing as well as comarketing programs our direct marketing activities include television print and webbased advertising as well as press relations consumer and trade events and industry and consumer communications we market to consumer and business audiences and focus on building awareness and generating demand for increased performance power efficiency and new capabilities 

 

purchases by customers often allow them to participate in cooperative advertising and marketing programs such as the intel inside ® program this program broadens the reach of our brands beyond the scope of our own direct advertising through the intel inside program certain customers are licensed to place intel logos on computers containing our microprocessors and processor technologies and to use our brands in marketing activities the program includes a market development component that accrues funds based on purchases and partially reimburses the oems for marketing activities for products featuring intel brands subject to the oems meeting defined criteria these marketing activities primarily include television print and an increased focus on webbased marketing we have also entered into joint marketing arrangements with certain customers 

 

competition 

 

the semiconductor industry is dynamic characterized by rapid advances in technology and frequent product introductions as unit volumes of a product grow production experience is accumulated and costs typically decrease further competition develops and prices decline the life cycle of our products is very short sometimes less than a year these short product life cycles and other factors lead to frequent negotiations with our oem customers which typically are large sophisticated buyers who are also operating in very competitive environments our ability to compete depends on our ability to navigate this environment by improving our products and processes faster than our competitors anticipating changing customer requirements developing and launching new products and platforms pricing our products competitively and reducing average unit costs see “risk factors” in part i item 1a of this form 10k 

 

our products compete primarily based on performance features price quality reliability brand recognition and availability we are focused on offering innovative products and worldwide support for our customers at competitive prices including providing improved energyefficient performance enhanced security manageability and integrated solutions we believe that our platform strategy provides us with a competitive advantage we offer platforms that incorporate various components designed and configured to work together to provide an optimized user computing solution compared to components that are used separately 

we believe that our network of manufacturing facilities and assembly and test facilities gives us a competitive advantage this network enables us to have more direct control over our processes quality control product cost volume timing of production and other factors these facilities require significant upfront capital spending and therefore make it difficult for us to reduce our costs in the shortterm many of our competitors do not own such facilities because they may not be able to afford to do so or because their business models involve the use of thirdparty foundries and assembly and test subcontractors for manufacturing and assembly and test the thirdparty foundries and subcontractors may also offer intellectual property design services and other goods and services to our competitors these “fabless semiconductor companies” include broadcom corporation nvidia corporation qualcomm incorporated and via technologies inc via some of our competitors own portions of such facilities through investment or jointventure arrangements with other companies 

 

we plan to continue to cultivate new businesses and work with the computing and communications industries through standards bodies trade associations oems odms and independent software and operating system vendors to help align the industry to offer products that take advantage of the latest market trends and usage models we frequently participate in industry initiatives designed to discuss and agree upon technical specifications and other aspects of technologies that could be adopted as standards by standardssetting organizations our competitors may also participate in the same initiatives and specification development our participation does not ensure that any standards or specifications adopted by these organizations will be consistent with our product planning 

 

microprocessors 

 

we continue to be largely dependent on the success of our microprocessor business our ability to compete depends on our ability to deliver new microprocessor products with increased performance capabilities and improved energyefficient performance at competitive prices some of our microprocessor competitors such as advanced micro devices inc amd market softwarecompatible products that compete with our processors we also face competition from companies offering rival architecture designs such as cell broadband engine architecture developed jointly by international business machines corporation ibm sony corporation and toshiba corporation power architecture offered by ibm arm architecture developed by arm limited and scalable processor architecture sparc offered by sun microsystems inc a subsidiary of oracle corporation in addition nvidia is seeking to position its graphics processors to compete with microprocessors by shifting some of a microprocessor’s workload to its graphics processor 

 

while amd has been our primary competitor in the market segments for microprocessors used in notebooks desktops and servers qualcomm and other companies using armbased designs are our primary competitors in the growing market segment for microprocessors used in handhelds including smartphones and mids our ability to compete with qualcomm and other competitors in this market segment depends on our ability to design and produce highperformance energyefficient microprocessors at competitive prices it also requires us to develop a software ecosystem that appeals to end users and software developers we have taken a number of steps to build this software ecosystem including developing the moblin tm based operating system and subsequently combining it with nokia corporation’s maemo software platform to create meego a linuxbased software platform that will run on multiple hardware platforms acquiring wind river systems inc and creating the intel ® atom tm developer program in addition in 2009 we entered into product development collaborations with lg electronics inc and nokia 

 

the following is a list of our main microprocessor competitors by market segment 

  

chipsets 

 

our chipsets compete with chipsets produced by companies such as amd including chipsets marketed under the ati technologies inc brand broadcom nvidia silicon integrated systems corporation and via we also compete with companies offering graphics components and other specialpurpose products used in the notebook netbook desktop and server market segments one aspect of our business model is to incorporate improved performance and advanced properties into our microprocessors and chipsets for which demand may increasingly be affected by competition from companies whose business models are based on dedicated chipsets and other components such as graphics controllers 

flash memory 

 

our nand flash memory products currently compete with nand products primarily manufactured by hynix semiconductor inc micron samsung electronics co ltd sandisk corporation and toshiba 

 

connectivity 

 

we offer products designed for wireless and wired connectivity the communications infrastructure including network processors and networked storage our wifi and wimax products currently compete with products manufactured by atheros communications inc broadcom qualcomm and other smaller companies 

 

competition lawsuits and government matters 

 

we are currently a party to a variety of lawsuits and government matters involving our competitive practices see “note 28 contingencies” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

 

acquisitions and strategic investments 

 

during 2009 we completed the acquisition of wind river systems inc a vendor of software for embedded devices the objective of the acquisition of wind river systems was to enable the introduction of products for the embedded and handheld market segments resulting in benefits for our existing operations see “note 15 acquisitions” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

 

intellectual property and licensing 

 

intellectual property rights that apply to our various products and services include patents copyrights trade secrets trademarks and maskwork rights we maintain a program to protect our investment in technology by attempting to ensure respect for our intellectual property rights the extent of the legal protection given to different types of intellectual property rights varies under different countries’ legal systems we intend to license our intellectual property rights where we can obtain adequate consideration see “competition” earlier in this section “risk factors” in part i item 1a and “note 28 contingencies” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

 

we have filed and obtained a number of patents in the us and other countries while our patents are an important element of our success our business as a whole is not significantly dependent on any one patent we and other companies in the computing telecommunications and related hightechnology fields typically apply for and receive in the aggregate tens of thousands of overlapping patents annually in the us and other countries we believe that the duration of the applicable patents that we are granted is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products because of the fast pace of innovation and product development our products are often obsolete before the patents related to them expire and sometimes are obsolete before the patents related to them are even granted as we expand our product offerings into new industries we also seek to extend our patent development efforts to patent such product offerings established competitors in existing and new industries as well as companies that purchase and enforce patents and other intellectual property may already have patents covering similar products there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain patents covering our own products or that we will be able to obtain licenses from such companies on favorable terms or at all 

 

the majority of the software that we distribute including software embedded in our component and systemlevel products is entitled to copyright protection to distinguish intel products from our competitors’ products we have obtained certain trademarks and trade names for our products and we maintain cooperative advertising programs with certain customers to promote our brands and to identify products containing genuine intel components we also protect certain details about our processes products and strategies as trade secrets keeping confidential the information that we believe provides us with a competitive advantage we have ongoing programs designed to maintain the confidentiality of such information 

 

compliance with environmental health and safety regulations 

 

our compliance efforts focus on monitoring regulatory and resource trends and setting companywide performance targets for key resources and emissions these targets address several parameters including product design chemical energy and water use climate change waste recycling and emissions 

intel focuses on reducing natural resource use the solid and chemical waste byproducts of our manufacturing processes and the environmental impact of our products we currently use a variety of materials in our manufacturing process that have the potential to adversely impact the environment and are subject to a variety of ehs laws and regulations for example lead and halogenated materials such as certain flame retardants and plastics have been used by the electronics industry for decades finding suitable replacements has been a technical challenge for the industry and we have worked for years with our suppliers and others in the industry to develop leadfree and halogenfree solutions 

 

we work with the us environmental protection agency epa nongovernmental organizations oems and retailers to help manage ewaste which includes electronic products nearing the end of their useful lives and promote recycling the european union eu requires producers of certain electrical and electronic equipment to develop programs that allow consumers to return products for recycling many states in the us have similar ewaste takeback laws the inconsistency of many ewaste takeback laws and the lack of local ewaste management options in many areas pose a challenge for our compliance efforts to mitigate these problems we communicate with our distributors to determine available options for complying with ewaste laws 

 

intel seeks to reduce our global greenhouse gas emissions by investing in energy conservation projects in our factories and working with suppliers to improve energy efficiency we take a holistic approach to power management addressing the challenge at the silicon package circuit micromacro architecture platform and software levels we recognize that climate change may cause general economic risk for further information on the risks of climate change see “risk factors” in part i item 1a of this form 10k we routinely monitor energy costs to understand the longrange impacts that rising costs may have on our business we see the potential for higher energy costs driven by climate change regulations this could include items applied to utilities that are passed along to customers such as carbon taxes or costs associated with emission cap and trade programs or renewable portfolio standards in particular regulations associated with the western climate initiative could have an impact on our company because a number of our large manufacturing facilities are located in the western us proposed regulations by the epa could impact our ability to obtain modifications in a timely manner for existing air permits at our manufacturing facilities in the us similarly our operations in ireland are already subject to the eu’s mandatory cap and trade scheme for globalwarming emissions all of our sites also may be impacted by utility programs directed by legislation or regulatory or other pressures that are targeted to pass costs through to users 

 

we maintain business recovery plans that are intended to ensure our ability to recover from natural disasters or other events that can be disruptive to our business many of our operations are located in semiarid regions such as israel and the southwestern us some climate change scenarios predict that such regions can become even more vulnerable to prolonged droughts we have had an aggressive water conservation program in place for many years we believe that our water conservation and recovery programs will help reduce our risk if water availability becomes more constrained in the future we further maintain longrange plans to identify potential future water conservation actions that we can take 

 

we are committed to sustainability and take a leadership position in promoting voluntary environmental initiatives and working proactively with governments environmental groups and industry to promote global environmental sustainability we believe that technology will be fundamental to finding solutions to the world’s environmental challenges and we are joining forces with industry business and governments to find and promote ways that technology can be used as a tool to combat climate change 

 

for several years we have been evaluating “green” design standards and incorporating green building concepts and practices into the construction of our buildings we are in the process of obtaining leadership in energy and environmental design leed certification for an office building under construction in israel and a newly constructed fabrication building in arizona we have been purchasing wind power and other forms of renewable energy at some of our major sites for several years at the beginning of 2008 we announced plans to purchase renewable energy certificates under a multiyear contract the purchase placed intel at the top of the epa’s green power partnership for 2008 and 2009 the purchase was intended to help stimulate the market for green power leading to additional generating capacity and ultimately lower costs 

executive officers of the registrant 

 

the following sets forth certain information with regard to our executive officers as of february 22 2010 ages are as of december 26 2009

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

fluctuations in demand for our products may harm our financial results and are difficult to forecast 

if demand for our products fluctuates as a result of economic conditions or for other reasons our revenue and profitability could be harmed important factors that could cause demand for our products to fluctuate include 

  

if product demand decreases our manufacturing or assembly and test capacity could be underutilized and we may be required to record an impairment on our longlived assets including facilities and equipment as well as intangible assets which would increase our expenses in addition if product demand decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately we could be required to write off inventory or record underutilization charges which would have a negative impact on our gross margin factoryplanning decisions may shorten the useful lives of longlived assets including facilities and equipment and cause us to accelerate depreciation in the long term if product demand increases we may not be able to add manufacturing or assembly and test capacity fast enough to meet market demand these changes in demand for our products and changes in our customers’ product needs could have a variety of negative effects on our competitive position and our financial results and in certain cases may reduce our revenue increase our costs lower our gross margin percentage or require us to recognize impairments of our assets 

 

litigation or regulatory proceedings could harm our business 

we may be subject to legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder consumer competition and other issues on a global basis as described in “note 28 contingencies” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k we are currently engaged in a number of litigation and regulatory matters particularly with respect to competition litigation and regulatory proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur an unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or in cases for which injunctive relief is sought an injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing or selling one or more products precluding particular business practices or requiring other remedies such as compulsory licensing of intellectual property if we were to receive an unfavorable ruling in a matter our business and results of operations could be materially harmed 

 

the semiconductor industry and our operations are characterized by a high percentage of costs that are fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term and by product demand that is highly variable and subject to significant downturns that may harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

the semiconductor industry and our operations are characterized by high costs such as those related to facility construction and equipment rd and employment and training of a highly skilled workforce that are either fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term at the same time demand for our products is highly variable and there have been downturns often in connection with maturing product cycles as well as downturns in general economic market conditions these downturns have been characterized by reduced product demand manufacturing overcapacity and resulting underutilization charges high inventory levels and lower average selling prices the combination of these factors may cause our revenue gross margin cash flow and profitability to vary significantly in both the short and long term 

we operate in intensely competitive industries and our failure to respond quickly to technological developments and incorporate new features into our products could harm our ability to compete 

we operate in intensely competitive industries that experience rapid technological developments changes in industry standards changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and improvements if we are unable to respond quickly and successfully to these developments we may lose our competitive position and our products or technologies may become uncompetitive or obsolete to compete successfully we must maintain a successful rd effort develop new products and production processes and improve our existing products and processes at the same pace or ahead of our competitors our rd efforts are aimed at solving increasingly complex problems and we do not expect that all of our projects will be successful if our rd efforts are unsuccessful our future results of operations could be materially harmed we may not be able to develop and market these new products successfully the products we invest in and develop may not be well received by customers and products developed and new technologies offered by others may affect demand for our products these types of events could have a variety of negative effects on our competitive position and our financial results such as reducing our revenue increasing our costs lowering our gross margin percentage and requiring us to recognize impairments on our assets 

 

we invest in companies for strategic reasons and may not realize a return on our investments 

we make investments in companies around the world to further our strategic objectives and support our key business initiatives such investments include equity or debt instruments of public or private companies and many of these instruments are nonmarketable at the time of our initial investment these companies range from earlystage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models the success of these companies is dependent on product development market acceptance operational efficiency and other key business factors the companies in which we invest may fail because they may not be able to secure additional funding obtain favorable investment terms for future financings or take advantage of liquidity events such as public offerings mergers and private sales if any of these private companies fail we could lose all or part of our investment in that company if we determine that an otherthantemporary decline in the fair value exists for an equity or debt investment in a public or private company in which we have invested we write down the investment to its fair value and recognize the related writedown as an investment loss we have significant investments in companies in the flash memory market segment and declines in this market segment or changes in management’s plans with respect to our investments in this market segment could result in significant impairment charges impacting gains losses on equity method investments and gains losses on other equity investments 

 

furthermore when the strategic objectives of an investment have been achieved or if the investment or business diverges from our strategic objectives we may decide to dispose of the investment our nonmarketable equity investments in private companies are not liquid and we may not be able to dispose of these investments on favorable terms or at all the occurrence of any of these events could harm our results additionally for cases in which we are required under equity method accounting to recognize a proportionate share of another company’s income or loss such income or loss may impact our earnings gains or losses from equity securities could vary from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of securities gains or losses from equity method investments and impairment charges related to debt instruments as well as equity and other investments 

 

our results of operations could vary as a result of the methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies 

the methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations see “critical accounting estimates” in part ii item 7 of this form 10k such methods estimates and judgments are by their nature subject to substantial risks uncertainties and assumptions and factors may arise over time that lead us to change our methods estimates and judgments changes in those methods estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations 

 

fluctuations in the mix of products sold may harm our financial results 

because of the wide price differences among and within notebook netbook desktop and server microprocessors the mix and types of performance capabilities of microprocessors sold affect the average selling price of our products and have a substantial impact on our revenue and gross margin our financial results also depend in part on the mix of other products that we sell such as chipsets flash memory and other semiconductor products in addition more recently introduced products tend to have higher associated costs because of initial overall development and production ramp fluctuations in the mix and types of our products may also affect the extent to which we are able to recover the fixed costs and investments associated with a particular product and as a result can harm our financial results 

our global operations subject us to risks that may harm our results of operations and financial condition 

we have sales offices rd manufacturing and assembly and test facilities in many countries and as a result we are subject to risks that may limit our ability to manufacture assemble and test design develop or sell products in particular countries which could in turn harm our results of operations and financial condition including 

  

in addition although substantially all of our products are sold in us dollars we incur a significant amount of certain types of expenses such as payroll utilities tax and marketing expenses as well as conduct certain investing and financing activities in local currencies our hedging programs reduce but do not entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements and therefore fluctuations in exchange rates could harm our results of operations and financial condition in addition changes in tariff and import regulations and in us and nonus monetary policies may harm our results of operations and financial condition by increasing our expenses and reducing our revenue varying tax rates in different jurisdictions could harm our results of operations and financial condition by increasing our overall tax rate 

 

we maintain a program of insurance coverage for various types of property casualty and other risks we place our insurance coverage with various carriers in numerous jurisdictions however there is a risk that one or more of our insurance providers may be unable to pay a claim the types and amounts of insurance that we obtain vary from time to time and from location to location depending on availability cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention the policies are subject to deductibles and exclusions that result in our retention of a level of risk on a selfinsurance basis losses not covered by insurance may be substantial and may increase our expenses which could harm our results of operations and financial condition 

 

failure to meet our production targets resulting in undersupply or oversupply of products may harm our business and results of operations 

production of integrated circuits is a complex process disruptions in this process can result from interruptions in our processes errors and difficulties in our development and implementation of new processes defects in materials disruptions in our supply of materials or resources and disruptions at our fabrication and assembly and test facilities due to for example accidents maintenance issues or unsafe working conditions—all of which could affect the timing of production ramps and yields we may not be successful or efficient in developing or implementing new production processes the occurrence of any of the foregoing may result in our failure to meet or increase production as desired resulting in higher costs or substantial decreases in yields which could affect our ability to produce sufficient volume to meet specific product demand the unavailability or reduced availability of certain products could make it more difficult to implement our platform strategy we may also experience increases in yields a substantial increase in yields could result in higher inventory levels and the possibility of resulting underutilization charges as we slow production to reduce inventory levels the occurrence of any of these events could harm our business and results of operations 

 

we may have difficulties obtaining the resources or products we need for manufacturing assembling and testing our products or operating other aspects of our business which could harm our ability to meet demand for our products and may increase our costs 

we have thousands of suppliers providing various materials that we use in the production of our products and other aspects of our business and we seek where possible to have several sources of supply for all of those materials however we may rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers or upon suppliers in a single country for these materials the inability of such suppliers to deliver adequate supplies of production materials or other supplies could disrupt our production processes or could make it more difficult for us to implement our business strategy in addition production could be disrupted by the unavailability of the resources used in production such as water silicon electricity and gases future environmental regulations could restrict the supply or increase the cost of certain of the materials that we currently use in our business the unavailability or reduced availability of the materials or resources that we use in our business may require us to reduce production of products or may require us to incur additional costs in order to obtain an adequate supply of those materials or resources the occurrence of any of these events could harm our business and results of operations 

costs related to product defects and errata may harm our results of operations and business 

costs associated with unexpected product defects and errata deviations from published specifications due to for example unanticipated problems in our manufacturing processes include 

  

these costs could be substantial and may therefore increase our expenses and lower our gross margin in addition our reputation with our customers or users of our products could be damaged as a result of such product defects and errata and the demand for our products could be reduced these factors could harm our financial results and the prospects for our business 

 

we may be subject to claims of infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights which could harm our business 

third parties may assert against us or our customers alleged patent copyright trademark or other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our business as described in “note 28 contingencies” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k we are currently engaged in a number of litigation matters involving intellectual property rights we may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims from certain individuals and companies who have acquired patent portfolios for the sole purpose of asserting such claims against other companies any claims that our products or processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others regardless of the merit or resolution of such claims could cause us to incur significant costs in responding to defending and resolving such claims and may divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from our business as a result of such intellectual property infringement claims we could be required or otherwise decide that it is appropriate to 

  

the occurrence of any of the foregoing could result in unexpected expenses or require us to recognize an impairment of our assets which would reduce the value of our assets and increase expenses in addition if we alter or discontinue our production of affected items our revenue could be harmed 

 

we may not be able to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights which may harm our ability to compete and harm our business 

our ability to enforce our patents copyrights software licenses and other intellectual property rights is subject to general litigation risks as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our intellectual property rights in various countries when we seek to enforce our rights we are often subject to claims that the intellectual property right is invalid is otherwise not enforceable or is licensed to the party against whom we are asserting a claim in addition our assertion of intellectual property rights often results in the other party seeking to assert alleged intellectual property rights of its own or assert other claims against us which could harm our business if we are not ultimately successful in defending ourselves against these claims in litigation we may not be able to sell a particular product or family of products due to an injunction or we may have to pay damages that could in turn harm our results of operations in addition governments may adopt regulations and governments or courts may render decisions requiring compulsory licensing of intellectual property to others or governments may require that products meet specified standards that serve to favor local companies our inability to enforce our intellectual property rights under these circumstances may harm our competitive position and our business 

we may be subject to intellectual property theft or misuse which could result in thirdparty claims and harm our business and results of operations 

we regularly face attempts by others to gain unauthorized access through the internet to our information technology systems by for example masquerading as authorized users or surreptitious introduction of software these attempts which might be the result of industrial or other espionage or actions by hackers seeking to harm the company its products or end users are sometimes successful one recent and sophisticated incident occurred in january 2010 around the same time as the recently publicized security incident reported by google we seek to detect and investigate these security incidents and to prevent their recurrence but in some cases we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects the theft andor unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information as a result of such an incident could adversely affect our competitive position and reduce marketplace acceptance of our products the value of our investment in rd product development and marketing could be reduced and third parties might assert against us or our customers claims related to resulting losses of confidential or proprietary information or enduser data andor system reliability our business could be subject to significant disruption and we could suffer monetary and other losses including the cost of product recalls and returns and reputational harm in the event of such incidents and claims 

 

our licenses with other companies and our participation in industry initiatives may allow other companies including our competitors to use our patent rights 

companies in the semiconductor industry often rely on the ability to license patents from each other in order to compete many of our competitors have broad licenses or crosslicenses with us and under current case law some of the licenses may permit these competitors to pass our patent rights on to others if one of these licensees becomes a foundry our competitors might be able to avoid our patent rights in manufacturing competing products in addition our participation in industry initiatives may require us to license our patents to other companies that adopt certain industry standards or specifications even when such organizations do not adopt standards or specifications proposed by us as a result our patents implicated by our participation in industry initiatives might not be available for us to enforce against others who might otherwise be deemed to be infringing those patents our costs of enforcing our licenses or protecting our patents may increase and the value of our intellectual property may be impaired 

 

decisions about the scope of operations of our business could affect our results of operations and financial condition 

changes in the business environment could lead to changes in our decisions about the scope of operations of our business and these changes could result in restructuring and asset impairment charges factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations with regard to changing the scope of our operations include 

  

our acquisitions divestitures and other transactions could disrupt our ongoing business and harm our results of operations 

in pursuing our business strategy we routinely conduct discussions evaluate opportunities and enter into agreements regarding possible investments acquisitions divestitures and other transactions such as joint ventures acquisitions and other transactions involve significant challenges and risks including risks that 

  

when we decide to sell assets or a business we may encounter difficulty in finding or completing divestiture opportunities or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner and the agreed terms and financing arrangements could be renegotiated due to changes in business or market conditions these circumstances could delay the accomplishment of our strategic objectives or cause us to incur additional expenses with respect to businesses that we want to dispose of or we may dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are less favorable than we had anticipated resulting in a loss on the transaction 

if we do enter into agreements with respect to acquisitions divestitures or other transactions we may fail to complete them due to 

  

further acquisitions divestitures and other transactions require substantial management resources and have the potential to divert our attention from our existing business these factors could harm our business and results of operations 

 

in order to compete we must attract retain and motivate key employees and our failure to do so could harm our results of operations 

in order to compete we must attract retain and motivate executives and other key employees hiring and retaining qualified executives scientists engineers technical staff and sales representatives are critical to our business and competition for experienced employees in the semiconductor industry can be intense to help attract retain and motivate qualified employees we use sharebased incentive awards such as employee stock options and nonvested share units restricted stock units if the value of such stock awards does not appreciate as measured by the performance of the price of our common stock or if our sharebased compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit our ability to attract retain and motivate employees could be weakened which could harm our results of operations 

 

our failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations worldwide could harm our business and results of operations 

the manufacturing and assembling and testing of our products require the use of hazardous materials that are subject to a broad array of ehs laws and regulations our failure to comply with any of those applicable laws or regulations could result in 

  

in addition our failure to manage the use transportation emissions discharge storage recycling or disposal of hazardous materials could subject us to increased costs or future liabilities existing and future environmental laws and regulations could also require us to acquire pollution abatement or remediation equipment modify our product designs or incur other expenses associated with such laws and regulations many new materials that we are evaluating for use in our operations may be subject to regulation under existing or future environmental laws and regulations that may restrict our use of one or more of such materials in our manufacturing assembly and test processes or products any of these restrictions could harm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter our manufacturing and assembly and test processes 

 

climate change poses both regulatory and physical risks that could harm our results of operations or affect the way we conduct our business 

in addition to the possible direct economic impact that climate change could have on us climate change mitigation programs and regulations can increase our costs for example the cost of perfluorocompounds pfcs a gas that we use in our manufacturing could increase over time under some climatechangefocused emissions trading programs that may be imposed by government regulation if the use of pfcs is prohibited we would need to obtain substitute materials that may cost more or be less available for our manufacturing operations in addition air quality permit requirements for our manufacturing operations could become more burdensome and cause delays in our ability to modify our facilities we also see the potential for higher energy costs driven by climate change regulations our costs could increase if utility companies pass on their costs such as those associated with carbon taxes emission cap and trade programs or renewable portfolio standards while we maintain business recovery plans that are intended to allow us to recover from natural disasters or other events that can be disruptive to our business we cannot be sure that our plans will fully protect us from all such disasters or events many of our operations are located in semiarid regions such as israel and the southwestern us some scenarios predict that these regions may become even more vulnerable to prolonged droughts due to climate change 

changes in our effective tax rate may harm our results of operations 

a number of factors may increase our future effective tax rates including 

  

any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could reduce net income for future periods 

 

interest and other net could be harmed by macroeconomic and other factors 

factors that could cause interest and other net in our consolidated statements of operations to fluctuate include

overview 

 

our goal is to be the preeminent provider of semiconductor chips and platforms for the worldwide digital economy our primary componentlevel products include microprocessors chipsets and flash memory to better align our major product groups around the core competencies of intel architecture and our manufacturing operations we completed the reorganization of our business in the fourth quarter of 2009 net revenue gross margin operating income and net income for the fourth and third quarters of 2009 and fiscal year 2009 and 2008 were as follows 

 

 

 

we started the year in one of the deepest recessions in our history and emerged from it with better products and technology in a strengthening market compared to the first quarter of 2008 revenue was down 26 in the first quarter of 2009 with the second and third quarters down 15 and 8 respectively compared to the second and third quarters of 2008 however our fourth quarter results reflected a strengthening demand across all regions and all product categories driven primarily by the notebook market segment fourth quarter revenue of 106 billion was up 13 compared to the third quarter nearly twice the seasonal average and up 28 compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

the launch of our microprocessor products using 32nm process technology was strong in the fourth quarter and was one of the contributors to the increase in our overall microprocessor average selling prices compared to the third quarter our server products also had a strong quarter and we saw a demand shift toward higher end products which also contributed to the increase in our average selling prices despite these fourth quarter increases our microprocessor average selling prices in 2009 were lower than in 2008 driven primarily by decreases in average selling prices in the notebook and desktop market segments 

 

with the launch of our 32nm products and fourth quarter record shipments of microprocessor units we are entering 2010 in a strong competitive position as we continue delivering improvements in our product offerings through the “ticktock” manufacturing process technology and product development cadence additionally our intel atom processors and related chipsets continue their strong ramp with revenue having increased nearly 900 million in 2009 compared to 2008 

 

we believe our total inventory levels of 29 billion though up compared to the third quarter of 2009 are appropriate based on our forecasts we believe that oem component inventories are roughly flat compared to the third quarter and below levels at the end of 2008 additionally our distributors’ inventories are down compared to the third quarter 

 

our fourth quarter gross margin percentage of 647 set a new quarterly record the fourth quarter gross margin percentage compared to the third quarter was positively impacted by lower inventory writeoffs higher microprocessor average selling prices and unit sales the lack of excess capacity charges and improving unit costs in the first quarter of 2010 we expect our gross margin percentage to decrease due to higher unit costs as we continue to ramp our 32nm products as well as seasonally lower microprocessor unit sales and lower microprocessor average selling prices 

 

in the fourth quarter of 2009 we made a 125 billion payment to amd as part of a settlement to end all outstanding litigation between the companies including antitrust litigation and crosslicense patent disputes also in the fourth quarter of 2009 the new york attorney general and the us federal trade commission filed antitrust suits against intel for further information on our litigation matters see “note 28 contingencies” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

 

from a financial condition perspective we ended 2009 with an investment portfolio of 139 billion consisting of cash and cash equivalents debt instruments included in trading assets and shortterm investments during 2009 we generated 112 billion in cash from operations despite paying the €106 billion 1447 billion european commission fine recorded in the second quarter of 2009 and the amd settlement recorded in the fourth quarter of 2009 during 2009 we issued 20 billion of convertible debt and utilized the proceeds from the convertible debt to repurchase 17 billion of common stock through our common stock repurchase program in addition during 2009 we returned 31 billion to stockholders through dividends in january 2010 our board of directors declared a dividend of 01575 per common share for the first quarter of 2010 an increase of 125 compared to our fourth quarter dividend 

 

in february 2010 we signed a definitive agreement with micron and numonyx under which micron agreed to acquire numonyx in an allstock transaction for further information see “note 11 nonmarketable equity investments” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k

strategy 

 

our goal is to be the preeminent provider of semiconductor chips and platforms for the worldwide digital economy as part of our overall strategy to compete in each relevant market segment we use our core competencies in the design and manufacture of integrated circuits as well as our financial resources global presence brand recognition and software development we believe that we have the scale capacity and global reach to establish new technologies and respond to customers’ needs quickly 

 

some of our key focus areas are listed below 

  

we believe that the proliferation of the internet including user demand for premium content and rich media drives the need for greater performance in pcs and servers older pcs are increasingly incapable of handling the tasks that businesses and individual consumers demand such as streaming video web conferencing online gaming and other memoryintensive applications as these tasks become even more demanding and require more computing power we believe that businesses and individual consumers will need and want to buy new pcs we also believe that increased internet traffic and the increasing use of cloud computing in which a group of linked servers provide a variety of applications and data to users over the internet create a need for greater server infrastructure including server products optimized for energyefficient performance and virtualization 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

we believe that the trend of mobile microprocessor unit growth outpacing the growth in desktop microprocessor units will continue and that the demand for mobile microprocessors will result in the increased development of products with form factors and uses that require lowpower microprocessors we also believe that these products will result in demand that is incremental to that of microprocessors designed for notebook and desktop computers as a growing number of households have multiple devices for different computing functions our silicon and manufacturing technology leadership allows us to develop lowpower microprocessors for these and other new uses and form factors we believe that intel atom processors give us the ability to extend intel architecture and drive growth in new market segments including a growing number of products that require processors specifically designed for embedded applications handhelds consumer electronics devices and netbooks we expect that our intel atom developer program will spur new applications that run on products using intel atom processors which will expedite our growth strategy in these new market segments the common elements for products in these new market segments are low power consumption and the ability to access the internet 

 

we are also focusing on the development of a new highly scalable manycore architecture aimed at parallel processing the simultaneous use of multiple cores to execute a computing task this architecture will initially be used as a software development platform for graphics and throughput computing the need for large amounts of computing performance consistently over a long period of time over time this architecture may be utilized in the development of products for scientific and professional workstations as well as highperformance computing applications 

 

in addition we offer and are continuing to develop advanced nand flash memory products focusing on systemlevel solutions for intel architecture platforms such as solidstate drives in support of our strategy to provide advanced flash memory products we continue to focus on the development of innovative products designed to address the needs of customers for reliable nonvolatile lowcost highdensity memory 

 

strategy by major market segment 

 

the strategy for our pc client group operating segment is to offer products that are incorporated into notebook netbook and desktop computers for consumers and businesses our strategy for the notebook computing market segment is to offer notebook pc products designed to improve performance battery life and wireless connectivity as well as to allow for the design of smaller lighter and thinner form factors we are also increasing our focus on notebook products designed to offer technologies that provide increased manageability and security and we continue to invest in the buildout of wimax our strategy for the netbook computing market segment is to offer products that enable affordable internetfocused devices with small form factors our strategy for the desktop computing market segment is to offer products that provide increased manageability security and energyefficient performance while lowering total cost of ownership for businesses for consumers in the desktop computing market segment we also focus on the design of components for highend enthusiast pcs and mainstream pcs with rich audio and video capabilities 

 

the strategy for our data center group operating segment is to offer products that provide leading performance energyefficiency and virtualization technology for server workstation and storage platforms we are also increasing our focus on products designed for highperformance and missioncritical computing cloud computing services and emerging markets in addition we offer wired connectivity devices that are incorporated into products that make up the infrastructure for the internet

critical accounting estimates 

 

the methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our consolidated financial statements some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain our most critical accounting estimates include 

  

below we discuss these policies further as well as the estimates and judgments involved 

 

nonmarketable equity investments 

 

we regularly invest in nonmarketable equity instruments of private companies which range from earlystage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models the carrying value of our nonmarketable equity investment portfolio excluding equity derivatives totaled 34 billion as of december 26 2009 41 billion as of december 27 2008 the majority of this balance as of december 26 2009 was concentrated in companies in the flash memory market segment our flash memory market segment investments include our investment in imft and im flash singapore llp imfs of 16 billion 21 billion as of december 27 2008 for further information see “note 11 nonmarketable equity investments” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

 

our nonmarketable equity investments are recorded using adjusted cost basis or the equity method of accounting depending on the facts and circumstances of each investment see “note 2 accounting policies” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k our nonmarketable equity investments are classified in other longterm assets on the consolidated balance sheets 

 

nonmarketable equity investments are inherently risky and a number of the companies in which we invest could fail their success is dependent on product development market acceptance operational efficiency and other key business factors depending on their future prospects the companies may not be able to raise additional funds when the funds are needed or they may receive lower valuations with less favorable investment terms than in previous financings and our investments would likely become impaired additionally financial markets and credit markets are volatile which could negatively affect the prospects of the companies we invest in their ability to raise additional capital and the likelihood of our being able to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings mergers and private sales for further information about our investment portfolio risks see “risk factors” in part i item 1a of this form 10k 

 

we determine the fair value of our nonmarketable equity investments quarterly for disclosure purposes however the investments are recorded at fair value only when an impairment charge is recognized we determine the fair value of our nonmarketable equity investments using the market and income approaches the market approach includes the use of financial metrics and ratios of comparable public companies such as projected revenues earnings and comparable performance multiples the selection of comparable companies requires management judgment and is based on a number of factors including comparable companies’ sizes growth rates industries development stages and other relevant factors the income approach includes the use of a discounted cash flow model which may include one or multiple discounted cash flow scenarios and requires the following significant estimates for the investee revenue based on assumed market segment size and assumed market segment share expenses capital spending and other costs and discount rates based on the risk profile of comparable companies estimates of market segment size market segment share expenses capital spending and other costs are developed by the investee andor intel using historical data and available market data the valuation of our nonmarketable investments also takes into account variables such as conditions reflected in the capital markets recent financing activities by the investees the investees’ capital structure and differences in seniority and rights associated with the investees’ capital 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

for nonmarketable equity investments the measurement of fair value requires significant judgment and includes quantitative and qualitative analysis of identified events or circumstances that impact the fair value of the investment such as 

  

if the fair value of an investment is below our carrying value we determine if the investment is other than temporarily impaired based on our quantitative and qualitative analysis which includes assessing the severity and duration of the impairment and the likelihood of recovery before disposal if the investment is considered to be other than temporarily impaired we write down the investment to its fair value impairments of nonmarketable equity investments were 221 million in 2009 over the past 12 quarters including the fourth quarter of 2009 impairments of nonmarketable equity investments ranged from 11 million to 896 million per quarter this range included impairments of 896 million during the fourth quarter of 2008 primarily related to a 762 million impairment charge on our investment in clearwire communications llc clearwire llc 

 

imftimfs 

 

imft and imfs are variable interest entities that are designed to manufacture and sell nand products to intel and micron at manufacturing cost we determine the fair value of our investment in imftimfs using the income approach based on a weighted average of multiple discounted cash flow scenarios of our nand solutions group business which requires the use of unobservable inputs unobservable inputs that require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments are the estimates for projected revenue and discount rate changes in management estimates for these unobservable inputs have the most significant effect on the fair value determination we did not have an otherthantemporary impairment on our investment in imftimfs in 2009 2008 or 2007 it is reasonably possible that the estimates used in the fair value determination could change in the near term which could result in an impairment of our investment 

 

longlived assets 

 

we assess the impairment of longlived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant underperformance of a business or product line in relation to expectations significant negative industry or economic trends and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets we measure the recoverability of assets that will continue to be used in our operations by comparing the carrying value of the asset grouping to our estimate of the related total future undiscounted net cash flows if an asset grouping’s carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows the asset grouping is considered to be impaired the impairment is measured by comparing the difference between the asset grouping’s carrying value and its fair value fair value is the price that would be received from selling an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date longlived assets such as goodwill intangible assets and property plant and equipment are considered nonfinancial assets and are recorded at fair value only when an impairment charge is recognized 

 

impairments of longlived assets are determined for groups of assets related to the lowest level of identifiable independent cash flows due to our asset usage model and the interchangeable nature of our semiconductor manufacturing capacity we must make subjective judgments in determining the independent cash flows that can be related to specific asset groupings in addition as we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions we must make subjective judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets primarily processspecific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements when we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated we accelerate the rate of depreciation over the assets’ new shorter useful lives over the past 12 quarters including the fourth quarter of 2009 impairments and accelerated depreciation of longlived assets ranged from 40 million to 300 million per quarter for further discussion on these asset impairment charges see “note 19 restructuring and asset impairment charges” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

income taxes 

 

we must make estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes as well as the interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions significant changes in these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 

 

we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets if recovery is not likely we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable we believe that we will ultimately recover a majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets however should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely recovery of a portion of our deferred tax assets is impacted by management’s plans with respect to holding or disposing of certain investments therefore changes in management’s plans with respect to holding or disposing of investments could affect our future provision for taxes 

 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a twostep process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any if we determine that a tax position will more likely than not be sustained on audit the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors such as changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law new audit activity and effectively settled issues determining whether an uncertain tax position is effectively settled requires judgment such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 

 

inventory 

 

the valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality the determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products the estimate of future demand is compared to workinprocess and finished goods inventory levels to determine the amount if any of obsolete or excess inventory as of december 26 2009 we had total workinprocess inventory of 1469 million and total finished goods inventory of 1029 million the demand forecast is included in the development of our shortterm manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuation and build decisions productspecific facts and circumstances reviewed in the inventory valuation process include a review of the customer base the stage of the product life cycle of our products consumer confidence and customer acceptance of our products as well as an assessment of the selling price in relation to the product cost if our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly we could be required to write off inventory which would negatively impact our gross margin 

 

in order to determine what costs can be included in the valuation of inventory we must determine normal capacity at our manufacturing and assembly and test facilities based on historical loadings of wafers compared to total available capacity if the factory loadings are below the established normal capacity level a portion of our manufacturing overhead costs would not be included in the cost of inventory and therefore would be recognized as cost of sales in that period which would negatively impact our gross margin we refer to these costs as excess capacity charges over the past 12 quarters excess capacity charges ranged from zero to 680 million per quarter

results of operations 

 

the following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of net revenue for the periods indicated 

 

 

 

the following graphs set forth revenue information of geographic regions for the periods indicated 

 

geographic breakdown of revenue 

 

 

our net revenue for 2009 decreased 7 compared to 2008 average selling prices for microprocessors and chipsets decreased and microprocessor and chipset unit sales increased compared to 2008 primarily due to the ramp of intel atom processors and chipsets which generally have lower average selling prices than our other microprocessor and chipset products revenue from the sale of nor flash memory products and communications products declined 740 million primarily as a result of business divestitures additionally an increase in revenue from the sale of nand flash memory products was mostly offset by a decrease in revenue from the sale of wireless connectivity products 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

revenue in the asiapacific region increased 2 compared to 2008 while revenue in the europe japan and americas regions decreased by 26 15 and 4 respectively compared to 2008 

 

our overall gross margin dollars for 2009 decreased 13 billion or 6 compared to 2008 our overall gross margin percentage increased slightly to 557 in 2009 from 555 in 2008 the slight increase in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to the gross margin percentage increases in the nand solutions group and data center group operating segments offset by the gross margin percentage decrease in the pc client group operating segment we derived a substantial majority of our overall gross margin dollars in 2009 and most of our overall gross margin dollars in 2008 from the sales of microprocessors in the pc client group and data center group operating segments see “business outlook” for a discussion of gross margin expectations 

 

our net revenue for 2008 decreased 2 compared to 2007 higher revenue from the sale of microprocessors and chipsets was more than offset by the impacts of divestitures and lower revenue from the sale of motherboards revenue from the sale of nor flash memory and cellular baseband products declined 17 billion primarily as a result of divestiture of these businesses revenue in the americas region decreased 4 in 2008 compared to 2007 revenue in the asiapacific europe and japan regions remained approximately flat in 2008 compared to 2007 

 

our overall gross margin dollars for 2008 were 208 billion an increase of 940 million or 5 compared to 2007 our overall gross margin percentage increased to 555 in 2008 from 519 in 2007 the increase in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to the gross margin percentage increase in the pc client group operating segment and to a lesser extent the gross margin percentage increase in the data center group operating segment in addition our gross margin percentage increased due to the divestiture of our nor flash memory business we derived most of our overall gross margin dollars in 2008 and 2007 from the sale of microprocessors in the pc client group and data center group operating segments 

 

pc client group 

 

the revenue and operating income for the pc client group pccg for the three years ended december 26 2009 were as follows 

 

 

 

net revenue for the pccg operating segment decreased by 18 billion or 6 in 2009 compared to 2008 microprocessors and chipsets within pccg include those designed for the notebook netbook and desktop computing market segments the decrease in microprocessor revenue was primarily due to lower notebook microprocessor average selling prices and lower desktop microprocessor unit sales and average selling prices these decreases were partially offset by a significant increase in netbook microprocessor unit sales due to the ramp of intel atom processors the decrease in chipset motherboard and other revenue was primarily due to lower chipset average selling prices and lower unit sales of wireless connectivity products partially offset by higher chipset unit sales 

 

operating income decreased by 18 billion or 19 in 2009 compared to 2008 the decrease was primarily due to lower revenue and approximately 810 million of higher factory underutilization charges partially offset by lower chipset and microprocessor unit costs 

 

for 2008 net revenue for the pccg operating segment increased slightly by 836 million or 3 compared to 2007 the increase in microprocessor revenue was primarily due to significantly higher notebook microprocessor unit sales partially offset by significantly lower notebook microprocessor average selling prices in addition lower desktop microprocessor unit sales were partially offset by the ramp of intel atom processors the increase in chipset motherboard and other revenue was primarily due to higher chipset unit sales partially offset by lower desktop motherboard unit sales 

 

operating income increased by 884 million or 10 in 2008 compared to 2007 the increase in operating income was primarily due to lower microprocessor and chipset unit costs partially offset by lower desktop microprocessor and chipset revenue and higher operating expenses in addition approximately 230 million of lower startup costs were offset by sales in 2007 of desktop microprocessors that had previously been written off and higher writeoffs of desktop microprocessor inventory in 2008 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

data center group 

 

the revenue and operating income for the data center group dcg for the three years ended december 26 2009 were as follows 

 

 

 

net revenue for the dcg operating segment decreased slightly by 140 million or 2 in 2009 compared to 2008 the increase in microprocessor revenue was due to higher microprocessor average selling prices partially offset by lower microprocessor unit sales the decrease in chipset motherboard and other revenue was primarily due to lower chipset average selling prices 

 

operating income increased by 164 million or 8 in 2009 compared to 2008 the increase in operating income was primarily due to higher microprocessor revenue and lower operating expenses partially offset by approximately 150 million of higher startup costs as well as lower chipset revenue 

 

for 2008 net revenue for the dcg operating segment increased slightly by 135 million or 2 compared to 2007 the increase in microprocessor revenue was due to higher microprocessor average selling prices the decrease in chipset motherboard and other revenue was primarily due to lower motherboard unit sales 

 

operating income was flat in 2008 compared to 2007 higher revenue was mostly offset by higher operating expenses 

 

other intel architecture operating segments 

 

the revenue and operating income for the other intel architecture operating segments other ia for the three years ended december 26 2009 were as follows 

 

 

 

net revenue for the other ia operating segments decreased by 361 million or 20 in 2009 compared to 2008 and operating loss for the other ia operating segments increased by 116 million in 2009 compared to 2008 the changes were primarily due to lower revenue from the sale of communications products within the embedded and communications group ecg primarily as a result of business divestitures 

 

for 2008 net revenue for the other ia operating segments decreased by 145 million or 8 compared to 2007 the decrease was primarily due to lower revenue from the sale of communications products within ecg primarily as a result of business divestitures partially offset by higher ecg microprocessor unit sales operating income loss decreased by 110 million in 2008 compared to 2007 the decrease was primarily due to higher operating expenses within the ultramobility group and to a lesser extent within the digital home group 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

operating expenses 

 

operating expenses for the three years ended december 26 2009 were as follows 

 

 

 

research and development rd spending was flat in 2009 compared to 2008 and was flat in 2008 compared to 2007 in 2009 compared to 2008 we had lower process development costs as we transitioned from rd to manufacturing using our 32nm process technology this decrease was offset by higher profitdependent compensation expenses in 2008 compared to 2007 we had lower product development expenses resulting from our divested businesses and slightly lower profitdependent compensation these decreases were offset by higher process development costs as we transitioned from manufacturing startup costs related to our 45nm process technology to rd of our 32nm process technology 

 

marketing general and administrative marketing general and administrative expenses increased 25 billion or 45 in 2009 compared to 2008 and were flat in 2008 compared to 2007 the increase in 2009 compared to 2008 was due to the charge of 1447 billion incurred as a result of the fine imposed by the european commission ec and the 125 billion payment to amd as part of a settlement agreement see “note 28 contingencies” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k to a lesser extent we had higher profitdependent compensation expenses that were partially offset by lower advertising expenses including cooperative advertising expenses in 2008 compared to 2007 we had higher legal expenses that were offset by lower profitdependent compensation and lower advertising expenses 

 

rd combined with marketing general and administrative expenses were 39 of net revenue in 2009 30 of net revenue in 2008 and 29 of net revenue in 2007 

 

restructuring and asset impairment charges the following table summarizes restructuring and asset impairment charges by plan for the three years ended december 26 2009 

 

 

 

2009 restructuring program 

 

in the first quarter of 2009 management approved plans to restructure some of our manufacturing and assembly and test operations these plans included closing two assembly and test facilities in malaysia one facility in the philippines and one facility in china stopping production at a 200mm wafer fabrication facility in oregon and ending production at our 200mm wafer fabrication facility in california we do not expect significant future charges related to the 2009 plan the following table summarizes charges for the 2009 restructuring plan during 2009 

 

 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

the following table summarizes the restructuring and asset impairment activity for the 2009 restructuring plan during 2009 

 

 

 

the net charges above include 208 million that relate to employee severance and benefit arrangements for 6500 employees of which 5400 employees had left the company as of december 26 2009 most of these employee actions occurred within manufacturing 

 

we estimate that these employee severance and benefit charges will result in gross annual savings of approximately 290 million the substantial majority of the savings will be realized within cost of sales 

 

2008 nand plan 

 

in the fourth quarter of 2008 management approved a plan with micron to discontinue the supply of nand flash memory from the 200mm facility within the imft manufacturing network the agreement resulted in a 215 million restructuring charge primarily related to the imft 200mm supply agreement the restructuring charge resulted in a reduction of our investment in imftimfs of 184 million a cash payment to micron of 24 million and other cash payments of 7 million the 2008 nand plan was completed at the end of 2008 

 

2006 efficiency program 

 

in the third quarter of 2006 management approved several actions as part of a restructuring plan designed to improve operational efficiency and financial results the following table summarizes charges for the 2006 efficiency program for the three years ended december 26 2009 

 

 

 

during 2006 as part of our assessment of our worldwide manufacturing capacity operations we placed for sale our fabrication facility in colorado springs colorado as a result of placing the facility for sale in 2006 we recorded a 214 million impairment charge to write down to fair value the land building and equipment we incurred 54 million in additional asset impairment charges as a result of market conditions related to the colorado springs facility during 2007 and additional charges in 2008 we sold the colorado springs facility in 2009 

 

in addition during 2007 we recorded land and building writedowns related to certain facilities in santa clara california we also incurred 85 million in asset impairment charges related to assets that we sold in conjunction with the divestiture of our nor flash memory business in 2007 and an additional 275 million in 2008 we determined the impairment charges based on the fair value less selling costs that we expected to receive upon completion of the divestiture in 2007 and determined the impairment charges using the revised fair value of the equity and note receivable that we received upon completion of the divestiture less selling costs in 2008 for further information on this divestiture see “note 16 divestitures” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k

the following table summarizes the restructuring and asset impairment activity for the 2006 efficiency program during 2008 and 2009 

 

 

 

we recorded the additional accruals net of adjustments as restructuring and asset impairment charges the 2006 efficiency plan is complete 

 

from the third quarter of 2006 through 2009 we incurred a total of 16 billion in restructuring and asset impairment charges related to this program these charges included a total of 686 million related to employee severance and benefit arrangements for 11300 employees a substantial majority of these employee actions affected employees within manufacturing information technology and marketing the restructuring and asset impairment charges also included 896 million in asset impairment charges 

 

we estimate that the total employee severance and benefit charges incurred as part of the 2006 efficiency program result in gross annual savings of approximately 11 billion we are realizing these savings within marketing general and administrative cost of sales and rd 

 

amortization of acquisitionrelated intangibles the increase of 29 million was due to amortization of intangibles primarily related to the acquisition of wind river systems completed in the third quarter of 2009 see “note 15 acquisitions” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

 

sharebased compensation 

 

sharebased compensation totaled 889 million in 2009 851 million in 2008 and 952 million in 2007 sharebased compensation was included in cost of sales and operating expenses 

 

as of december 26 2009 unrecognized sharebased compensation costs and the weighted average periods over which the costs are expected to be recognized were as follows

gains losses on equity method investments net 

 

gains losses on equity method investments net were as follows 

 

 

 

impairment charges in 2008 included a 762 million impairment charge recognized on our investment in clearwire llc and a 250 million impairment charge recognized on our investment in numonyx we recognized the impairment charge on our investment in clearwire llc to write down our investment to its fair value primarily due to the fair value being significantly lower than the cost basis of our investment in the fourth quarter of 2008 the impairment charge on our investment in numonyx was due to a general decline in 2008 in the nor flash memory market segment our equity method losses were primarily related to numonyx 31 million in 2009 and 87 million in 2008 clearwire llc 27 million in 2009 and clearwire corporation 184 million in 2008 and 104 million in 2007 see “note 11 nonmarketable equity investments” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k during 2007 we recognized 110 million of income due to the reorganization of one of our investments included within “other net” in the table above 

 

gains losses on other equity investments net 

 

gains losses on other equity investments net were as follows 

 

 

 

impairment charges in 2008 included a 176 million impairment charge recognized on our investment in clearwire corporation and 97 million of impairment charges on our investment in micron the impairment charge on our investment in clearwire corporation was due to the fair value being significantly lower than the cost basis of our investment at the end of the fourth quarter of 2008 the impairment charges on our investment in micron reflected the difference between our cost basis and the fair value of our investment in micron at the end of the second and third quarters of 2008 in addition we recognized higher gains on equity derivatives in 2009 compared to 2008 

 

interest and other net 

 

the components of interest and other net were as follows 

 

 

 

we recognized lower interest income in 2009 compared to 2008 as a result of lower interest rates the average interest rate earned during 2009 decreased by 24 percentage points compared to 2008 in addition lower gains on divestitures zero in 2009 and 59 million in 2008 were more than offset by 70 million of fair value gains in 2009 on our trading assets compared to 130 million of fair value losses in 2008 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

interest and other net decreased in 2008 compared to 2007 due to lower interest income and fair value losses that we experienced in 2008 on our trading assets interest income was lower in 2008 compared to 2007 as a result of lower interest rates partially offset by higher average investment balances the average interest rate earned during 2008 decreased by 19 percentage points compared to 2007 

 

provision for taxes 

 

our provision for taxes and effective tax rate were as follows 

 

 

 

we generated a higher percentage of our profits from lower tax jurisdictions in 2009 compared to 2008 in addition the 2009 tax rate was positively impacted by the reversal of previously accrued taxes of 366 million on settlements effective settlements and related remeasurements of various uncertain tax positions compared to a reversal of 103 million for such matters in 2008 these impacts were partially offset by the recognition of the ec fine of 1447 billion with no associated tax benefit in addition our 2008 effective tax rate was negatively impacted by the recognition of a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of realizing tax benefits related to impairments of our equity investments 

 

our effective income tax rate increased in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to the recognition of a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of realizing tax benefits related to impairments of our equity investments in addition the rate increased in 2008 compared to 2007 due to the reversal of previously accrued taxes of 481 million including 50 million of accrued interest related to settlements with the us internal revenue service irs in the first and second quarters of 2007

liquidity and capital resources 

 

 

 

sources and uses of cash in millions 

 

 

in summary our cash flows were as follows 

 

 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

operating activities 

 

cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain noncash items and changes in certain assets and liabilities for 2009 compared to 2008 the 244 million increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to changes in assets and liabilities partially offset by lower net income income taxes paid net of refunds in 2009 compared to 2008 were 31 billion lower on lower income before taxes and timing of payments 

 

changes in assets and liabilities for 2009 compared to 2008 included the following 

  

for 2009 and 2008 our two largest customers accounted for 38 of our net revenue with one of these customers accounting for 21 of our net revenue in 2009 20 in 2008 and another customer accounting for 17 of our net revenue in 2009 18 in 2008 these two largest customers accounted for 41 of our accounts receivable as of december 26 2009 and december 27 2008 

 

for 2008 compared to 2007 the 17 billion decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the 17 billion decrease in net income while total adjustments to reconcile net income to cash provided by operating activities including net changes in assets and liabilities were approximately flat effective 2008 cash flows related to marketable debt instruments classified as trading assets are included in investing activities 

 

investing activities 

 

investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures net investment purchases maturities disposals and cash used for acquisitions 

 

the increase in cash used for investing activities in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily due to an increase in net purchases of availableforsale investments and trading assets and higher cash paid for acquisitions these increases were partially offset by a decrease in investments in nonmarketable equity investments our investments in nonmarketable equity investments in 2008 included 10 billion for an ownership interest in clearwire llc 

 

our capital expenditures were 45 billion in 2009 52 billion in 2008 and 50 billion in 2007 capital expenditures for 2010 are currently expected to be higher than our 2009 expenditures and are expected to be funded by cash flows from operating activities 

 

the decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily due to a decrease in purchases of availableforsale debt investments in addition the related cash flows for marketable debt instruments classified as trading assets were included in investing activities for 2008 and previously they had been included in operating activities 

 

financing activities 

 

financing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases and retirement of common stock payment of dividends to stockholders issuance of longterm debt and proceeds from the sale of shares through employee equity incentive plans 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

the decrease in cash used in financing activities in 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily due to a decrease in repurchases and retirement of common stock and the issuance of longterm debt partially offset by lower proceeds from sales of shares through employee equity incentive plans we used the majority of the proceeds from the 2009 issuance of longterm debt to repurchase and retire common stock during 2009 we repurchased 18 billion of common stock compared to 72 billion in 2008 as of december 26 2009 57 billion remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization of 25 billion we base our level of common stock repurchases on internal cash management decisions and this level may fluctuate proceeds from the sale of shares through employee equity incentive plans totaled 400 million in 2009 compared to 11 billion in 2008 as a result of a lower volume of employee exercises of stock options our total dividend payments in 2009 remained flat from 2008 at 31 billion we have paid a cash dividend in each of the past 69 quarters in january 2010 our board of directors declared a cash dividend of 01575 per common share for the first quarter of 2010 the dividend is payable on march 1 2010 to stockholders of record on february 7 2010 

 

the higher cash used in financing activities in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily due to an increase in repurchases and retirement of common stock and lower proceeds from the sale of shares pursuant to employee equity incentive plans 

 

liquidity 

 

cash generated by operations is used as our primary source of liquidity as of december 26 2009 cash and cash equivalents debt instruments included in trading assets and shortterm investments totaled 139 billion in addition to the 139 billion we have 45 billion in loans receivable and other longterm investments that we include when assessing our investment portfolio 

 

the credit quality of our investment portfolio remains high with creditrelated otherthantemporary impairment losses on our availableforsale debt instruments limited to less than 55 million cumulatively since the beginning of 2008 in addition we continue to be able to invest in highcreditquality investments substantially all of our investments in debt instruments are with aa2 or better rated issuers and a substantial majority of the issuers are rated aaaa3 or better 

 

as of december 26 2009 cumulative unrealized gains net of corresponding hedging activities related to debt instruments classified as trading assets and cumulative unrealized gains related to debt instruments classified as availableforsale were insignificant as of december 27 2008 our cumulative unrealized losses net of corresponding hedging activities related to debt instruments classified as trading assets were 145 million as of december 27 2008 our cumulative unrealized losses related to debt instruments classified as availableforsale were 215 million 

 

our commercial paper program provides another potential source of liquidity we have an ongoing authorization from our board of directors to borrow up to 30 billion including through the issuance of commercial paper maximum borrowings under our commercial paper program during 2009 were 610 million although no commercial paper remained outstanding as of december 26 2009 our commercial paper was rated a1 by standard  poor’s and p1 by moody’s as of december 26 2009 we also have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the sec pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt equity and other securities 

 

we believe that we have the financial resources needed to meet business requirements for the next 12 months including capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test working capital requirements and potential dividends common stock repurchases and acquisitions or strategic investments 

 

fair value of financial instruments 

 

fair value is the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date when determining fair value we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and we consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability see “note 5 fair value” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

 

credit risk is factored into the valuation of financial instruments that we measure and record at fair value on a recurring basis when fair value is determined using observable market prices the credit risk is incorporated into the market price of the financial instrument when fair value is determined using pricing models such as a discounted cash flow model the issuer’s credit risk andor intel’s credit risk is factored into the calculation of the fair value as appropriate 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

marketable debt instruments 

 

as of december 26 2009 our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included 175 billion of marketable debt instruments of these instruments 657 million was classified as level 1 158 billion as level 2 and 11 billion as level 3 

 

when available we use observable market prices for identical securities to value our marketable debt instruments if observable market prices are not available we use nonbinding market consensus prices that we seek to corroborate with observable market data if available or unobservable market data when prices from multiple sources are available for a given instrument we use observable market quotes to price our instruments in lieu of prices from other sources 

 

our balance of marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 1 was classified as such due to the usage of observable market prices for identical securities that are traded in active markets marketable debt instruments in this category generally include certain of our corporate bonds government bonds and money market fund deposits management judgment was required to determine the levels at which sufficient volume and frequency of transactions are met for a market to be considered active our assessment of an active market for our marketable debt instruments generally takes into consideration activity during each week of the onemonth period prior to the valuation date of each individual instrument including the number of days each individual instrument trades and the average weekly trading volume in relation to the total outstanding amount of the issued instrument 

 

approximately 10 of our balance of marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 2 was classified as such due to the usage of observable market prices for identical securities that are traded in less active markets when observable market prices for identical securities are not available we price our marketable debt instruments using nonbinding market consensus prices that are corroborated with observable market data quoted market prices for similar instruments or pricing models such as a discounted cash flow model with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data nonbinding market consensus prices are based on the proprietary valuation models of pricing providers or brokers these valuation models incorporate a number of inputs including nonbinding and binding broker quotes observable market prices for identical andor similar securities and the internal assumptions of pricing providers or brokers that use observable market inputs and to a lesser degree unobservable market inputs we corroborate the nonbinding market consensus prices with observable market data using statistical models when observable market data exists the discounted cash flow model uses observable market inputs such as liborbased yield curves currency spot and forward rates and credit ratings approximately 40 of our balance of marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 2 was classified as such due to the usage of nonbinding market consensus prices that are corroborated with observable market data and approximately 50 due to the usage of a discounted cash flow model marketable debt instruments classified as level 2 generally include commercial paper bank time deposits municipal bonds certain of our money market fund deposits and a majority of corporate bonds and government bonds 

 

our marketable debt instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 3 were classified as such due to the lack of observable market data to corroborate either the nonbinding market consensus prices or the nonbinding broker quotes when observable market data is not available we corroborate the nonbinding market consensus prices and nonbinding broker quotes using unobservable data if available marketable debt instruments in this category generally include assetbacked securities and certain of our corporate bonds all of our investments in assetbacked securities were classified as level 3 and substantially all of them were valued using nonbinding market consensus prices that we were not able to corroborate with observable market data due to the lack of transparency in the market for assetbacked securities 

 

equity securities 

 

as of december 26 2009 our portfolio of assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included 773 million of marketable equity securities of these securities 676 million was classified as level 1 because the valuations were based on quoted prices for identical securities in active markets our assessment of an active market for our marketable equity securities generally takes into consideration activity during each week of the onemonth period prior to the valuation date for each individual security including the number of days each individual equity security trades and the average weekly trading volume in relation to the total outstanding shares of that security the remaining marketable equity securities of 97 million were classified as level 2 because their valuations were either based on quoted prices for identical securities in less active markets or adjusted for securityspecific restrictions 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

contractual obligations 

 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of december 26 2009 

 

 

 

 

  

contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services generally include agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on intel and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction the table above also includes agreements to purchase raw materials that have cancellation provisions requiring little or no payment the amounts under such contracts are included in the table above because management believes that cancellation of these contracts is unlikely and expects to make future cash payments according to the contract terms or in similar amounts for similar materials for other obligations with cancellation provisions the amounts included in the table above were limited to the noncancelable portion of the agreement terms andor the minimum cancellation fee 

 

we have entered into certain agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods that specify minimum prices and quantities based on a percentage of the total available market or based on a percentage of our future purchasing requirements due to the uncertainty of the future market and our future purchasing requirements obligations under these agreements are not included in the table above we estimate our obligation under these agreements as of december 26 2009 to be approximately as follows less than one year—364 million one to three years—3 million more than three years—zero our purchase orders for other products are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons in addition some of our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

contractual obligations that are contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones are not included in the table above these obligations include contingent fundingpayment obligations and milestonebased equity investment funding these arrangements are not considered contractual obligations until the milestone is met by the third party assuming that all future milestones are met additional required payments related to these obligations were not significant as of december 26 2009 

 

for the majority of restricted stock units granted the number of shares issued on the date the restricted stock units vest is net of the minimum statutory withholding requirements that we pay in cash to the appropriate taxing authorities on behalf of our employees the obligation to pay the relative taxing authority is not included in the table above as the amount is contingent upon continued employment in addition the amount of the obligation is unknown as it is based in part on the market price of our common stock when the awards vest 

 

we have a contractual obligation to purchase the output of imft in proportion to our investments 49 as of december 26 2009 we also have several agreements with micron related to intellectual property rights and rd funding related to nand flash manufacturing and imft the obligation to purchase our proportion of imft’s inventory was 100 million as of december 26 2009 see “note 11 nonmarketable equity investments” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

 

the expected timing of payments of the obligations above are estimates based on current information timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations 

 

offbalancesheet arrangements 

 

as of december 26 2009 with the exception of a guarantee for the repayment of 275 million in principal of the payment obligations of numonyx under its senior credit facility as well as accrued unpaid interest expenses of the lenders and penalties we did not have any significant offbalancesheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk in february 2010 we signed a definitive agreement with micron and numonyx under which micron agreed to acquire numonyx in an allstock transaction the senior credit facility that is supported by intel’s guarantee is expected to be repaid in full following the closing of this transaction see “note 11 nonmarketable equity investments” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

tablestart 


 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

we use derivative financial instruments primarily to manage currency exchange rate and interest rate risk and to a lesser extent equity market and commodity price risk all of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial positions as of december 26 2009 and december 27 2008 actual results may differ materially 

 

currency exchange rates 

 

we generally hedge currency risks of nonusdollardenominated investments in debt instruments and loans receivable with offsetting currency forward contracts currency options or currency interest rate swaps gains and losses on these nonuscurrency investments would generally be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments resulting in a negligible net exposure to loss 

 

substantially all of our revenue and a majority of our expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars however certain operating expenditures and capital purchases are incurred in or exposed to other currencies primarily the japanese yen the euro and the israeli shekel we have established balance sheet and forecasted transaction currency risk management programs to protect against fluctuations in fair value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in exchange rates we generally utilize currency forward contracts and to a lesser extent currency options in these hedging programs our hedging programs reduce but do not always entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements see “risk factors” in part i item 1a of this form 10k we considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that a weighted average adverse change of 20 in currency exchange rates could be experienced in the near term such an adverse change after taking into account hedges and offsetting positions would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before taxes of less than 40 million as of december 26 2009 less than 55 million as of december 27 2008 

 

interest rates 

 

we are exposed to interest rate risk related to our investment portfolio and debt issuances the primary objective of our investments in debt instruments is to preserve principal while maximizing yields to achieve this objective the returns on our investments in debt instruments are generally based on the usdollar threemonth libor a hypothetical decrease in interest rates of 10 would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our debt issuances of approximately 205 million as of december 26 2009 an increase of approximately 150 million as of december 27 2008 a hypothetical decrease in interest rates of up to 10 would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our investment portfolio of approximately 10 million as of december 26 2009 an increase of approximately 15 million as of december 27 2008 these hypothetical decreases in interest rates after taking into account hedges and offsetting positions would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our net investment position of approximately 195 million as of december 26 2009 and 135 million as of december 27 2008 the fluctuations in fair value of our debt issuances and investment portfolio reflect only the direct impact of the change in interest rates other economic variables such as equity market fluctuations and changes in relative credit risk could result in a significantly higher decline in our net investment portfolio for further information on how credit risk is factored into the valuation of our investment portfolio and debt issuances see “fair value of financial instruments” in part ii item 7 of this form 10k 

 

equity prices 

 

our marketable equity investments include marketable equity securities and equity derivative instruments such as warrants and options to the extent that our marketable equity securities have strategic value we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our equity market exposure through hedging activities however for our investments in strategic equity derivative instruments including warrants we may enter into transactions to reduce or eliminate the equity market risks for securities that we no longer consider strategic we evaluate legal market and economic factors in our decision on the timing of disposal and whether it is possible and appropriate to hedge the equity market risk 

 

we hold derivative instruments that seek to offset changes in liabilities related to the equity market risks of certain deferred compensation arrangements the gains and losses from changes in fair value of these derivatives are designed to offset the gains and losses on the related liabilities resulting in an insignificant net exposure to loss 

as of december 26 2009 the fair value of our marketable equity securities and our equity derivative instruments including hedging positions was 805 million 362 million as of december 27 2008 our marketable equity securities include our investments in clearwire corporation and micron carried at a fair market value of 250 million and 148 million respectively as of december 26 2009 to determine reasonably possible decreases in the market value of our marketable equity investments we analyzed the expected market price sensitivity of our marketable equity investment portfolio assuming a loss of 50 in market prices and after reflecting the impact of hedges and offsetting positions the aggregate value of our marketable equity investments could decrease by approximately 405 million based on the value as of december 26 2009 a decrease in value of approximately 220 million based on the value as of december 27 2008 using an assumed loss of 60 the decrease in the assumed loss percentage from december 27 2008 to december 26 2009 is due to lower expected overall equity market volatility 

 

many of the same factors that could result in an adverse movement of equity market prices affect our nonmarketable equity investments although we cannot always quantify the impact directly financial markets and credit markets are volatile which could negatively affect the prospects of the companies we invest in their ability to raise additional capital and the likelihood of our being able to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings mergers and private sales these types of investments involve a great deal of risk and there can be no assurance that any specific company will grow or become successful consequently we could lose all or part of our investment our nonmarketable equity investments excluding investments accounted for under the equity method had a carrying amount of 939 million as of december 26 2009 10 billion as of december 27 2008 as of december 26 2009 the carrying amount of our nonmarketable equity method investments was 25 billion 30 billion as of december 27 2008 a substantial majority of this balance as of december 26 2009 was concentrated in companies in the flash memory market segment our flash memory market segment investments include our investment of 16 billion in imftimfs 21 billion as of december 27 2008 and 453 million in numonyx 484 million as of december 27 2008 

 

in february 2010 we signed a definitive agreement with micron and numonyx under which micron agreed to acquire numonyx in an allstock transaction the value of the micron common stock that we would receive upon the closing of the transaction is subject to equity market risk for further information see “note 11 nonmarketable equity investments” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

 

based on management’s evaluation with the participation of our ceo and chief financial officer cfo as of the end of the period covered by this report our ceo and cfo have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the exchange act are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in sec rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

 

there were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

 

management report on internal control over financial reporting 

 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 

 

management assessed our internal control over financial reporting as of december 26 2009 the end of our fiscal year management based its assessment on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission management’s assessment included evaluation of elements such as the design and operating effectiveness of key financial reporting controls process documentation accounting policies and our overall control environment 

 

based on our assessment management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the fiscal year to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles we reviewed the results of management’s assessment with the audit committee of our board of directors 

 

our independent registered public accounting firm ernst  young llp independently assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as stated in their attestation report which is included at the end of part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

 

our management including the ceo and cfo does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures

manufacturing and assembly and test 

 

as of december 27 2008 70 of our wafer fabrication including microprocessors and chipsets was conducted within the us at our facilities in arizona oregon massachusetts new mexico and california the remaining 30 of our wafer fabrication was conducted outside the us at our facilities in ireland and israel 

 

as of december 27 2008 we primarily manufactured our products in wafer fabrication facilities at the following locations 

 

 

 

we expect to increase the capacity of certain facilities listed above through additional investments in capital equipment in addition to our current facilities we are building a 300mm wafer fabrication facility in china subsequent to the end of 2008 management approved plans to restructure some of our manufacturing and assembly and test operations and align our manufacturing and assembly and test capacity to current market conditions these actions which are expected to take place beginning in 2009 include stopping production at a 200mm wafer fabrication facility in oregon and ending production at our 200mm wafer fabrication facility in california 

 

as of december 27 2008 the substantial majority of our microprocessors were manufactured on 300mm wafers using our 45nm process technology in the second half of 2009 we expect to begin manufacturing microprocessors using our 32nm process technology as we move to each succeeding generation of manufacturing process technology we incur significant startup costs to prepare each factory for manufacturing however continuing to advance our process technology provides benefits that we believe justify these costs the benefits of moving to each succeeding generation of manufacturing process technology can include using less space per transistor reducing heat output from each transistor andor increasing the number of integrated features on each chip these advancements can result in microprocessors that are higher performing consume less power andor cost less to manufacture 

 

to augment capacity we use thirdparty manufacturing companies foundries to manufacture wafers for certain components including networking and communications products in addition we primarily use subcontractors to manufacture boardlevel products and systems and purchase certain communications networking products from external vendors principally in the asiapacific region 

 

our nand flash memory products are manufactured by imft a nand flash memory manufacturing company that we formed with micron technology inc we currently purchase 49 of the manufactured output of imft assembly and test of nand flash memory products is performed by micron and other external subcontractors see “note 6 equity method and cost method investments” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

 

during the second quarter of 2008 we completed the divestiture of our nor flash memory business in exchange for an ownership interest in numonyx bv we entered into supply and services agreements that involved the manufacture and the assembly and test of nor flash memory products for numonyx through 2008 in the fourth quarter of 2008 we agreed with numonyx to extend certain supply and service agreements through the end of 2009 in addition we are leasing a wafer fabrication facility located in israel to numonyx that facility is not shown in our above listing of wafer fabrication facilities see “note 6 equity method and cost method investments” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

 

following the manufacturing process the majority of our components are subject to assembly and test we perform our components assembly and test at facilities in malaysia china costa rica and the philippines we are building a new assembly and test facility in vietnam that is expected to begin production in 2010 to augment capacity we use subcontractors to perform assembly of certain products primarily chipsets and networking and communications products the restructuring plans described above include closing two assembly and test facilities in malaysia one facility in the philippines and one facility in china and are expected to take place beginning in 2009 

our employment practices are consistent with and we expect our suppliers and subcontractors to abide by local country law in addition we impose a minimum employee age requirement as well as progressive environmental health and safety ehs requirements regardless of local law 

 

we have thousands of suppliers including subcontractors providing our various materials and service needs we set expectations for supplier performance and reinforce those expectations with periodic assessments we communicate those expectations to our suppliers regularly and work with them to implement improvements when necessary we seek where possible to have several sources of supply for all of these materials and resources but we may rely on a single or limited number of suppliers or upon suppliers in a single country in those cases we develop and implement plans and actions to reduce the exposure that would result from a disruption in supply we have entered into longterm contracts with certain suppliers to ensure a portion of our silicon supply 

 

our products typically are produced at multiple intel facilities at various sites around the world or by subcontractors who have multiple facilities however some products are produced in only one intel or subcontractor facility and we seek to implement actions and plans to reduce the exposure that would result from a disruption at any such facility see “risk factors” in part i item 1a of this form 10k 

 

research and development 

 

we are committed to investing in worldclass technology development particularly in the design and manufacture of integrated circuits research and development rd expenditures in 2008 were 57 billion 58 billion in fiscal year 2007 and 59 billion in fiscal year 2006 

 

our rd activities are directed toward developing the technology innovations that we believe will deliver our next generation of products and platforms which will in turn enable new form factors and new usage models for businesses and consumers our rd activities range from design and development of products to developing and refining manufacturing processes to researching future technologies and products 

 

we are focusing our rd efforts on advanced computing communications and wireless technologies as well as energy efficiency by developing new microarchitectures advancing our silicon manufacturing process technology delivering the next generation of microprocessors and chipsets improving our platform initiatives and developing software solutions and tools to support our technologies our rd efforts enable new levels of performance and address areas such as scalability for multicore architectures energy efficiency system manageability and security ease of use and new communications capabilities in addition we are making significant rd investments in growth areas such as soc mids embedded applications consumer electronics and graphics 

 

as part of our rd efforts we plan to introduce a new microarchitecture for our mobile desktop and intel xeon processors approximately every two years and ramp the next generation of silicon process technology in the intervening years we refer to this as our “ticktock” technology development cadence our leadership in silicon technology has enabled us to make “moore’s law” a reality moore’s law predicted that transistor density on integrated circuits would double about every two years our leadership in silicon technology has also helped to expand on the advances anticipated by moore’s law by bringing new capabilities into silicon and producing new products and platforms optimized for a wider variety of applications in 2008 we introduced a new microarchitecture using our 45nm process technology we are currently developing 32nm process technology our nextgeneration process technology and expect to begin manufacturing products using that technology in the second half of 2009 

 

our rd model is based on a global organization that emphasizes a collaborative approach to identifying and developing new technologies leading standards initiatives and influencing regulatory policy to accelerate the adoption of new technologies our rd initiatives are performed by various business groups within the company and we centrally manage key crossbusiness group product initiatives to align and prioritize our rd activities across these groups in addition we may augment our rd initiatives by investing in companies or entering into agreements with companies that have similar rd focus areas for example we have an agreement with micron for joint development of nand flash memory technologies 

employees 

 

as of december 27 2008 we had approximately 83900 employees worldwide with more than 50 of these employees located in the us worldwide we had approximately 86300 employees as of december 29 2007 and 94100 as of december 30 2006 

 

sales and marketing 

 

customers 

 

we sell our products primarily to original equipment manufacturers oems and original design manufacturers odms odms provide design andor manufacturing services to branded and unbranded privatelabel resellers in addition we sell our products to other manufacturers including makers of a wide range of industrial and communications equipment our customers also include pc and network communications products users who buy pc components and our other products through distributor reseller retail and oem channels throughout the world in certain instances we have entered into supply agreements to continue to manufacture and sell products of divested business lines to acquiring companies during certain transition periods 

 

our worldwide reseller sales channel consists of thousands of indirect customers who are systems builders that purchase intel microprocessors and other products from our distributors we have a boxed processor program that allows distributors to sell intel microprocessors in small quantities to these systemsbuilder customers boxed processors are also available in direct retail outlets 

 

in 2008 hewlettpackard company accounted for 20 of our net revenue 17 in 2007 and dell inc accounted for 18 of our net revenue 18 in 2007 no other customer accounted for more than 10 of our net revenue for information about revenue and operating income by operating segment and revenue from unaffiliated customers by geographic regioncountry see “results of operations” in part ii item 7 and “note 25 operating segment and geographic information” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

 

sales arrangements 

 

our products are sold or licensed through sales offices throughout the world sales of our products are typically made via purchase orders that contain standard terms and conditions covering matters such as pricing payment terms and warranties as well as indemnities for issues specific to our products such as patent and copyright indemnities from time to time we may enter into additional agreements with customers covering for example changes from our standard terms and conditions new product development and marketing privatelabel branding and other matters most of our sales are made using electronic and webbased processes that allow the customer to review inventory availability and track the progress of specific goods ordered pricing on particular products may vary based on volumes ordered and other factors we also offer discounts rebates and other incentives to customers to increase acceptance of our products and technology 

 

our products are typically shipped under terms that transfer title to the customer even in arrangements for which the recognition of revenue and related costs of sales is deferred our standard terms and conditions of sale typically provide that payment is due at a later date generally 30 days after shipment delivery or the customer’s use of the product our credit department sets accounts receivable and shipping limits for individual customers to control credit risk to intel arising from outstanding account balances we assess credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis and from this analysis we establish credit limits and determine whether we will seek to use one or more credit support devices such as obtaining some form of thirdparty guaranty or standby letter of credit or obtaining credit insurance for all or a portion of the account balance if necessary credit losses may still be incurred due to bankruptcy fraud or other failure of the customer to pay for information about our allowance for doubtful receivables see “schedule ii—valuation and qualifying accounts” in part iv of this form 10k 

 

most of our sales to distributors are made under agreements allowing for price protection on unsold merchandise and a right of return on stipulated quantities of unsold merchandise under the price protection program we give distributors credits for the difference between the original price paid and the current price that we offer on most products there is no contractual limit on the amount of price protection nor is there a limit on the time horizon under which price protection is granted the right of return granted generally consists of a stock rotation program in which distributors are able to exchange certain products based on the number of qualified purchases made by the distributor although we have the option to grant credit for repair or replace defective product there is no contractual limit on the amount of credit granted to a distributor 

distribution 

 

typically distributors handle a wide variety of products including those that compete with our products and fill orders for many customers we also utilize thirdparty sales representatives who generally do not offer directly competitive products but may carry complementary items manufactured by others sales representatives do not maintain a product inventory instead their customers place orders directly with us or through distributors 

 

backlog 

 

we do not believe that backlog as of any particular date is meaningful as our sales are made primarily pursuant to standard purchase orders for delivery of products only a small portion of our orders is noncancelable and the dollar amount associated with the noncancelable portion is not significant 

 

seasonal trends 

 

our microprocessor sales generally have followed a seasonal trend historically our sales have been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year consumer purchases of pcs have historically been higher in the second half of the year primarily due to backtoschool and holiday demand in addition purchases from businesses have also historically tended to be higher in the second half of the year this seasonal trend did not occur in 2008 and there can be no assurance that it will resume in the future 

 

marketing 

 

our corporate marketing objectives are to build a strong intel corporate brand that connects with consumers and have a limited set of product brands for our advanced microprocessors and related technologies our intention is to have a limited number of meaningful and valuable brands in our portfolio to aid in making informed choices and making technology purchase decisions easier for both businesses and consumers the intel core i7 intel core 2 extreme intel core 2 quad intel core 2 duo intel atom pentium celeron intel xeon and itanium trademarks make up our processor brands microprocessors are at the center of our most advanced processor technologies which include intel centrino processor technology and intel core 2 processors with vpro technology 

 

we promote brand awareness and generate demand through our own direct marketing as well as comarketing programs our direct marketing activities include television print and webbased advertising as well as press relations consumer and trade events and industry and consumer communications we market to consumer and business audiences and focus on building awareness and generating demand for increased performance power efficiency and new capabilities 

 

purchases by customers often allow them to participate in cooperative advertising and marketing programs such as the intel inside ® program this program broadens the reach of our brands beyond the scope of our own direct advertising through the intel inside program certain customers are licensed to place intel logos on computers containing our microprocessors and processor technologies and to use our brands in marketing activities the program includes a market development component that accrues funds based on purchases and partially reimburses the oems for marketing activities for products featuring intel brands subject to the oems meeting defined criteria these marketing activities primarily include television webbased marketing and print and in the beginning of 2008 we increased our focus on webbased marketing we have also entered into joint marketing arrangements with certain customers 

 

competition 

 

the semiconductor industry is dynamic characterized by rapid advances in technology and frequent product introductions as unit volumes of a product grow production experience is accumulated and costs typically decrease further competition develops and prices decline the life cycle of our products is very short sometimes less than a year these short product life cycles and other factors lead to frequent negotiations with our oem customers which typically are large sophisticated buyers who are also operating in very competitive environments our ability to compete depends on our ability to navigate this environment by improving our products and processes faster than our competitors anticipating changing customer requirements developing and launching new products and platforms pricing our products competitively and reducing average unit costs see “risk factors” in part i item 1a of this form 10k 

our products compete primarily based on performance features price quality reliability brand recognition and availability we are focused on offering innovative products and worldwide support for our customers at competitive prices including providing improved energyefficient performance enhanced security manageability and integrated solutions we believe that our platform strategy provides us with a competitive advantage we offer platforms that incorporate various components designed and configured to work together to provide an optimized user computing solution compared to components that are used separately 

 

our competitors range in size from large established multinational companies with multiple product lines to smaller companies and new entrants to the marketplace that compete in specialized market segments some of our competitors may have development agreements with other companies and in some cases our competitors may also be our customers or suppliers product offerings may cross over into multiple product categories providing us with new opportunities but also resulting in more competition it may be difficult for us to compete in market segments in which our competitors have established products and brand recognition 

 

we believe that our network of manufacturing facilities and assembly and test facilities gives us a competitive advantage this network enables us to have more direct control over our processes quality control product cost volume timing of production and other factors these facilities require significant upfront capital spending and many of our competitors do not own such facilities because they may not be able to afford to do so or because their business models involve the use of thirdparty facilities for manufacturing and assembly and test these “fabless semiconductor companies” include broadcom corporation nvidia corporation qualcomm incorporated and via technologies inc via some of our competitors own portions of such facilities through investment or jointventure arrangements with other companies advanced micro devices inc amd intends to sell an interest in its manufacturing operations 

 

a group of foundries and assembly and test subcontractors offers their services to companies that do not own facilities or to companies needing additional capacity these foundries and subcontractors may also offer intellectual property design services and other goods and services to our competitors a disadvantage of our approach compared to fabless semiconductor companies is that it is more difficult for us to reduce our costs in the short term also competitors who outsource their manufacturing and assembly and test operations can significantly reduce their capital expenditures 

 

we plan to continue to cultivate new businesses and work with the computing and communications industries through standards bodies trade associations oems odms and independent software and operating system vendors to help align the industry to offer products that take advantage of the latest market trends and usage models we frequently participate in industry initiatives designed to discuss and agree upon technical specifications and other aspects of technologies that could be adopted as standards by standardssetting organizations our competitors may also participate in the same initiatives and specification development our participation does not ensure that any standards or specifications adopted by these organizations will be consistent with our product planning 

 

microprocessors 

 

we continue to be largely dependent on the success of our microprocessor business our ability to compete depends on our ability to deliver new microprocessor products with improved overall performance and improved energyefficient performance at competitive prices some of our microprocessor competitors such as amd market softwarecompatible products that compete with our processors we also face competition from companies offering rival architecture designs such as cell broadband engine architecture developed jointly by international business machines corporation ibm sony corporation and toshiba corporation power architecture offered by ibm arm architecture developed by arm limited and scalable processor architecture sparc offered by sun microsystems inc nvidia has developed a programming interface to attempt to expand the use of its graphics processors to accomplish generalpurpose computing functions typically performed by a microprocessor in highly parallel applications 

 

the following is a list of our main microprocessor competitors by market segment 

  

in addition our intel atom processor family competes against processors offered by amd and via and from companies using rival architectures such as arm and mips 

chipsets 

 

our chipsets compete in the various market segments against different types of chipsets that support either our microprocessor products or rival microprocessor products competing chipsets are produced by companies such as amd including chipsets marketed under the ati technologies inc brand nvidia silicon integrated systems corporation and via 

 

we also compete with companies offering graphics components and other specialpurpose products used in the desktop mobile and enterprise market segments one aspect of our business model is to incorporate improved performance and advanced properties into our microprocessors and chipsets for which demand may increasingly be affected by competition from companies such as nvidia and amd including products marketed under the ati technologies inc brand whose business models are based on incorporating improved performance into dedicated chipsets and other components such as graphics controllers 

 

flash memory 

 

our nand flash memory products currently compete with nor and nand products primarily manufactured by hynix semiconductor inc micron numonyx samsung electronics co ltd sandisk corporation spansion inc and toshiba 

 

connectivity 

 

we offer products designed for wired and wireless connectivity the communications infrastructure including network processors and networked storage our wifi and wimax products currently compete with products manufactured by atheros communications inc broadcom qualcomm and other smaller companies 

 

competition lawsuits and government investigations 

 

we are currently a party to a variety of lawsuits and government investigations involving our competitive practices see “note 24 contingencies” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

 

acquisitions and strategic investments 

 

during 2008 we completed two acquisitions qualifying as business combinations see “note 11 acquisitions” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k also we completed the divestiture of our nor flash memory business in exchange for an ownership interest in numonyx 

 

additionally in 2008 we made a significant strategic investment in clearwire communications llc clearwire llc during the fourth quarter of 2008 clearwire corporation and sprint nextel corporation combined their respective wimax businesses in conjunction with additional capital contributions from intel and other investors to form a new company that retained the name clearwire corporation the additional capital contributions included our cash investment of 10 billion our preexisting investment in clearwire corporation old clearwire corporation was converted into shares of the new company new clearwire corporation and the additional capital contribution of 10 billion was invested in clearwire llc a wholly owned subsidiary of the new clearwire corporation for further discussion of our equity method investment in clearwire llc see “note 6 equity method and cost method investments” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

intellectual property and licensing 

 

intellectual property rights that apply to our various products and services include patents copyrights trade secrets trademarks and maskwork rights we maintain a program to protect our investment in technology by attempting to ensure respect for our intellectual property rights the extent of the legal protection given to different types of intellectual property rights varies under different countries’ legal systems we intend to license our intellectual property rights where we can obtain adequate consideration see “competition” in part i item 1 “risk factors” in part i item 1a and “note 24 contingencies” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

 

we have filed and obtained a number of patents in the us and other countries while our patents are an important element of our success our business as a whole is not significantly dependent on any one patent we and other companies in the computing telecommunications and related hightechnology fields typically apply for and receive in the aggregate tens of thousands of overlapping patents annually in the us and other countries we believe that the duration of the applicable patents that we are granted is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products because of the fast pace of innovation and product development our products are often obsolete before the patents related to them expire and sometimes are obsolete before the patents related to them are even granted as we expand our product offerings into new industries we also seek to extend our patent development efforts to patent such product offerings established competitors in existing and new industries as well as companies that purchase and enforce patents and other intellectual property may already have patents covering similar products there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain patents covering our own products or that we will be able to obtain licenses from such companies on favorable terms or at all 

 

the majority of the software that we distribute including software embedded in our component and systemlevel products is entitled to copyright protection to distinguish intel products from our competitors’ products we have obtained certain trademarks and trade names for our products and we maintain cooperative advertising programs with certain customers to promote our brands and to identify products containing genuine intel components we also protect certain details about our processes products and strategies as trade secrets keeping confidential the information that we believe provides us with a competitive advantage we have ongoing programs designed to maintain the confidentiality of such information 

 

compliance with environmental health and safety regulations 

 

our compliance efforts focus on monitoring regulatory and resource trends and setting companywide performance targets for key resources and emissions these targets address several parameters including product design chemical energy and water use climate change waste recycling and emissions 

 

intel focuses on reducing natural resource use the solid and chemical waste byproducts of our manufacturing processes and the environmental impact of our products we currently use a variety of materials in our manufacturing process that have the potential to adversely impact the environment and are subject to a variety of ehs laws and regulations for example lead and halogenated materials such as certain flame retardants and plastics have been used by the electronics industry for decades finding suitable replacements has been a technical challenge for the industry and we have worked for years with our suppliers and others in the industry to develop leadfree and halogenfree solutions 

 

we work with the us environmental protection agency epa nongovernmental organizations oems and retailers to help manage ewaste which includes electronic products nearing the end of their useful lives and promote recycling the european union requires producers of certain electrical and electronic equipment to develop programs that allow consumers to return products for recycling many states in the us have similar ewaste takeback laws the inconsistency of many ewaste takeback laws and the lack of local ewaste management options in many areas pose a challenge for our compliance efforts to mitigate these problems we work with our distributors to provide recycling options for our products 

intel seeks to reduce our global greenhouse gas emissions by investing in energy conservation projects in our factories and working with suppliers to improve energy efficiency we take a holistic approach to power management addressing the challenge at the silicon package circuit micromacro architecture platform and software levels we recognize that climate change may cause general economic risk for additional information on the risks of climate change see “risk factors” in item 1a of this form 10k we routinely monitor energy costs to understand the longrange impacts that rising costs may have on our business we see the potential for higher energy costs driven by climate change regulations this could include items applied to utilities that are passed along to customers such as carbon taxes or costs associated with emission cap and trade programs or renewable portfolio standards in particular regulations associated with the western climate initiative could have an impact on our company because a number of our large manufacturing facilities are located in the western united states similarly our operations in ireland are already subject to the european union’s mandatory cap and trade scheme for globalwarming emissions all of our sites also may be impacted by utility programs directed by legislation regulatory or other pressures that are targeted to pass costs through to users 

 

we maintain business recovery plans that are intended to ensure our ability to recover from natural disasters or other events that can be disruptive to our business many of our operations are located in semiarid regions such as israel and the southwestern united states some climate change scenarios predict that such regions can become even more vulnerable to prolonged droughts due to climate change we have had an aggressive water conservation program in place for many years we believe that our water conservation and recovery programs will help reduce our risk if water availability becomes more constrained in the future we further maintain longrange plans to identify potential future water conservation actions that we can take 

 

we are committed to sustainability and take a leadership position in promoting voluntary environmental initiatives and working proactively with governments environmental groups and industry to promote global environmental sustainability we believe that technology will be fundamental to finding solutions to the world’s environmental challenges and we are joining forces with industry business and governments to find and promote ways that technology can be used as a tool to combat climate change 

 

for several years we have been evaluating “green” design standards and incorporating green building concepts and practices into the construction of our buildings we are in the process of obtaining leadership in energy and environmental design leed certification for an office building under construction in israel and a newly constructed fabrication building in arizona we have been purchasing wind power and other forms of renewable energy at some of our major sites for several years at the beginning of 2008 we announced plans to purchase renewable energy certificates under a multiyear contract the purchase placed intel at the top of the epa’s green power partnership for 2008 the purchase was intended to help stimulate the market for green power leading to additional generating capacity and ultimately lower costs 

 

executive officers of the registrant 

 

the following sets forth certain information with regard to our executive officers as of february 20 2009 ages are as of december 27 2008 

 

 

 

 




 item 1a risk factors 

 

fluctuations in demand for our products may harm our financial results and are difficult to forecast 

current uncertainty in global economic conditions poses a risk to the overall economy as consumers and businesses have deferred and may continue to defer purchases in response to tighter credit and less discretionary spending which negatively affect product demand and other related matters if demand for our products fluctuates as a result of economic conditions or for other reasons our revenue and gross margin could be harmed important factors that could cause demand for our products to fluctuate include 

  

if product demand decreases our manufacturing or assembly and test capacity could be underutilized and we may be required to record an impairment on our longlived assets including facilities and equipment as well as intangible assets which would increase our expenses in addition if product demand decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately we could be required to write off inventory or record underutilization charges which would have a negative impact on our gross margin factoryplanning decisions may shorten the useful lives of longlived assets including facilities and equipment and cause us to accelerate depreciation in the long term if product demand increases we may not be able to add manufacturing or assembly and test capacity fast enough to meet market demand these changes in demand for our products and changes in our customers’ product needs could have a variety of negative effects on our competitive position and our financial results and in certain cases may reduce our revenue increase our costs lower our gross margin percentage or require us to recognize impairments of our assets 

 

the recent financial crisis could negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the recent financial crisis affecting the banking system and financial markets and the going concern threats to financial institutions have resulted in a tightening in the credit markets a low level of liquidity in many financial markets and extreme volatility in credit fixed income and equity markets there could be a number of followon effects from the credit crisis on intel’s business including insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product delays inability of customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products andor customer insolvencies counterparty failures negatively impacting our treasury operations increased expense or inability to obtain shortterm financing of intel’s operations from the issuance of commercial paper and increased impairment charges due to declines in the fair values of marketable debt or equity investments the current volatility in the financial markets and overall economic uncertainty increase the risk that the actual amounts realized in the future on our debt and equity investments will differ significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them 

 

the semiconductor industry and our operations are characterized by a high percentage of costs that are fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term and by product demand that is highly variable and subject to significant downturns that may harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

the semiconductor industry and our operations are characterized by high costs such as those related to facility construction and equipment rd and employment and training of a highly skilled workforce that are either fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term at the same time demand for our products is highly variable and there have been downturns often in connection with maturing product cycles as well as downturns in general economic market conditions such as the current economic environment these downturns have been characterized by reduced product demand manufacturing overcapacity and resulting excess capacity charges high inventory levels and lower average selling prices the combination of these factors may cause our revenue gross margin cash flow and profitability to vary significantly in both the short and long term 

we operate in intensely competitive industries and our failure to respond quickly to technological developments and incorporate new features into our products could harm our ability to compete 

we operate in intensely competitive industries that experience rapid technological developments changes in industry standards changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and improvements if we are unable to respond quickly and successfully to these developments we may lose our competitive position and our products or technologies may become uncompetitive or obsolete to compete successfully we must maintain a successful rd effort develop new products and production processes and improve our existing products and processes at the same pace or ahead of our competitors we may not be able to develop and market these new products successfully the products we invest in and develop may not be well received by customers and products developed and new technologies offered by others may affect demand for our products these types of events could have a variety of negative effects on our competitive position and our financial results such as reducing our revenue increasing our costs lowering our gross margin percentage and requiring us to recognize impairments on our assets 

 

we may be subject to litigation proceedings that could harm our business 

we may be subject to legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder consumer competition and other issues on a global basis as described in “note 24 contingencies” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k we are currently engaged in a number of litigation matters particularly with respect to competition litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur an unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or in cases for which injunctive relief is sought an injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing or selling one or more products if we were to receive an unfavorable ruling in a matter our business and results of operations could be materially harmed 

 

we invest in companies for strategic reasons and may not realize a return on our investments 

we make investments in companies around the world to further our strategic objectives and support our key business initiatives such investments include equity or debt instruments of public or private companies and many of these instruments are nonmarketable at the time of our initial investment these companies range from earlystage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models the success of these companies is dependent on product development market acceptance operational efficiency and other key business factors the companies in which we invest may fail because they may not be able to secure additional funding obtain favorable investment terms for future financings or take advantage of liquidity events such as public offerings mergers and private sales the current economic environment may increase the risk of failure for many of the companies in which we invest due to limited access to credit and reduced frequency of liquidity events if any of these private companies fail we could lose all or part of our investment in that company if we determine that an otherthantemporary decline in the fair value exists for an equity investment in a public or private company in which we have invested we write down the investment to its fair value and recognize the related writedown as an investment loss the majority of our nonmarketable equity investment portfolio balance is concentrated in companies in the flash memory market segment and wireless connectivity market segment and declines in these market segments or changes in management’s plans with respect to our investments in these market segments could result in significant impairment charges impacting gainslosses on equity method investments and gainslosses on other equity investments 

 

furthermore when the strategic objectives of an investment have been achieved or if the investment or business diverges from our strategic objectives we may decide to dispose of the investment our nonmarketable equity investments in private companies are not liquid and we may not be able to dispose of these investments on favorable terms or at all the occurrence of any of these events could harm our results of operations additionally for cases in which we are required under equity method accounting to recognize a proportionate share of another company’s income or loss such income and loss may impact our earnings gains or losses from equity securities could vary from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of securities gains or losses from equity method investments and impairment charges related to debt instruments as well as equity and other investments 

 

our results of operations could vary as a result of the methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies 

the methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations see “critical accounting estimates” in part ii item 7 of this form 10k such methods estimates and judgments are by their nature subject to substantial risks uncertainties and assumptions and factors may arise over time that lead us to change our methods estimates and judgments changes in those methods estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations the current volatility in the financial markets and overall economic uncertainty increase the risk that the actual amounts realized in the future on our debt and equity investments will differ significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them 

fluctuations in the mix of products sold may harm our financial results 

because of the wide price differences among and within mobile desktop and server microprocessors the mix and types of performance capabilities of microprocessors sold affect the average selling price of our products and have a substantial impact on our revenue and gross margin our financial results also depend in part on the mix of other products that we sell such as chipsets flash memory and other semiconductor products in addition more recently introduced products tend to have higher associated costs because of initial overall development and production ramp fluctuations in the mix and types of our products may also affect the extent to which we are able to recover the fixed costs and investments associated with a particular product and as a result can harm our financial results 

 

our global operations subject us to risks that may harm our results of operations and financial condition 

we have sales offices rd manufacturing and assembly and test facilities in many countries and as a result we are subject to risks associated with doing business globally our global operations may be subject to risks that may limit our ability to manufacture assemble and test design develop or sell products in particular countries which could in turn harm our results of operations and financial condition including 

  

in addition although most of our products are sold in us dollars we incur a significant amount of certain types of expenses such as payroll utilities tax and marketing expenses as well as certain investing and financing activities in local currencies our hedging programs reduce but do not entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements and therefore fluctuations in exchange rates could harm our business operating results and financial condition in addition changes in tariff and import regulations and in us and nonus monetary policies may harm our operating results and financial condition by increasing our expenses and reducing our revenue varying tax rates in different jurisdictions could harm our operating results and financial condition by increasing our overall tax rate 

 

we maintain a program of insurance coverage for various types of property casualty and other risks we place our insurance coverage with various carriers in numerous jurisdictions the types and amounts of insurance that we obtain vary from time to time and from location to location depending on availability cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention the policies are subject to deductibles and exclusions that result in our retention of a level of risk on a selfinsurance basis losses not covered by insurance may be substantial and may increase our expenses which could harm our results of operations and financial condition in addition the recent financial crisis could pose solvency risks for our insurers which could reduce our coverage if one or more of our insurance providers is unable to pay a claim 

 

failure to meet our production targets resulting in undersupply or oversupply of products may harm our business and results of operations 

production of integrated circuits is a complex process disruptions in this process can result from interruptions in our processes errors and difficulties in our development and implementation of new processes defects in materials disruptions in our supply of materials or resources and disruptions at our fabrication and assembly and test facilities due to for example accidents maintenance issues or unsafe working conditions—all of which could affect the timing of production ramps and yields we may not be successful or efficient in developing or implementing new production processes the occurrence of any of the foregoing may result in our failure to meet or increase production as desired resulting in higher costs or substantial decreases in yields which could affect our ability to produce sufficient volume to meet specific product demand the unavailability or reduced availability of certain products could make it more difficult to implement our platform strategy we may also experience increases in yields a substantial increase in yields could result in higher inventory levels and the possibility of resulting excess capacity charges as we slow production to reduce inventory levels the occurrence of any of these events could harm our business and results of operations 

we may have difficulties obtaining the resources or products we need for manufacturing assembling and testing our products or operating other aspects of our business which could harm our ability to meet demand for our products and may increase our costs 

we have thousands of suppliers providing various materials that we use in the production of our products and other aspects of our business and we seek where possible to have several sources of supply for all of those materials however we may rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers or upon suppliers in a single country for these materials the inability of such suppliers to deliver adequate supplies of production materials or other supplies could disrupt our production processes or could make it more difficult for us to implement our business strategy in addition production could be disrupted by the unavailability of the resources used in production such as water silicon electricity and gases the unavailability or reduced availability of the materials or resources that we use in our business may require us to reduce production of products or may require us to incur additional costs in order to obtain an adequate supply of those materials or resources the occurrence of any of these events could harm our business and results of operations 

 

costs related to product defects and errata may harm our results of operations and business 

costs associated with unexpected product defects and errata deviations from published specifications due to for example unanticipated problems in our manufacturing processes include 

  

these costs could be substantial and may therefore increase our expenses and lower our gross margin in addition our reputation with our customers or users of our products could be damaged as a result of such product defects and errata and the demand for our products could be reduced these factors could harm our financial results and the prospects for our business 

 

we may be subject to claims of infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights which could harm our business 

from time to time third parties may assert against us or our customers alleged patent copyright trademark or other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our business as described in “note 24 contingencies” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k we are currently engaged in a number of litigation matters involving intellectual property rights we may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims from certain individuals and companies who have acquired patent portfolios for the sole purpose of asserting such claims against other companies any claims that our products or processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others regardless of the merit or resolution of such claims could cause us to incur significant costs in responding to defending and resolving such claims and may divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from our business as a result of such intellectual property infringement claims we could be required or otherwise decide that it is appropriate to 

  

the occurrence of any of the foregoing could result in unexpected expenses or require us to recognize an impairment of our assets which would reduce the value of our assets and increase expenses in addition if we alter or discontinue our production of affected items our revenue could be harmed 

we may not be able to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights which may harm our ability to compete and harm our business 

our ability to enforce our patents copyrights software licenses and other intellectual property rights is subject to general litigation risks as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our intellectual property rights in various countries when we seek to enforce our rights we are often subject to claims that the intellectual property right is invalid is otherwise not enforceable or is licensed to the party against whom we are asserting a claim in addition our assertion of intellectual property rights often results in the other party seeking to assert alleged intellectual property rights of its own against us if we are not ultimately successful in defending ourselves against these claims in litigation we may not be able to sell a particular product or family of products due to an injunction or we may have to pay damages that could in turn harm our results of operations in addition governments may adopt regulations or courts may render decisions requiring compulsory licensing of intellectual property to others or governments may require that products meet specified standards that serve to favor local companies our inability to enforce our intellectual property rights under these circumstances may harm our competitive position and our business 

 

our licenses with other companies and our participation in industry initiatives may allow other companies including our competitors to use our patent rights 

companies in the semiconductor industry often rely on the ability to license patents from each other in order to compete many of our competitors have broad licenses or crosslicenses with us and under current case law some of these licenses may permit these competitors to pass our patent rights on to others if one of these licensees becomes a foundry our competitors might be able to avoid our patent rights in manufacturing competing products in addition our participation in industry initiatives may require us to license our patents to other companies that adopt certain industry standards or specifications even when such organizations do not adopt standards or specifications proposed by us as a result our patents implicated by our participation in industry initiatives might not be available for us to enforce against others who might otherwise be deemed to be infringing those patents our costs of enforcing our licenses or protecting our patents may increase and the value of our intellectual property may be impaired 

 

changes in our decisions with regard to restructuring and efficiency efforts and other factors could affect our results of operations and financial condition 

factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations with regard to restructuring actions include 

  

in order to compete we must attract retain and motivate key employees and our failure to do so could harm our results of operations 

in order to compete we must attract retain and motivate executives and other key employees hiring and retaining qualified executives scientists engineers technical staff and sales representatives are critical to our business and competition for experienced employees in the semiconductor industry can be intense to help attract retain and motivate qualified employees we use sharebased incentive awards such as employee stock options and nonvested share units restricted stock units if the value of such stock awards does not appreciate as measured by the performance of the price of our common stock or if our sharebased compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit our ability to attract retain and motivate employees could be weakened which could harm our results of operations 

our failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations worldwide could harm our business and results of operations 

the manufacturing and assembling and testing of our products require the use of hazardous materials that are subject to a broad array of ehs laws and regulations our failure to comply with any of these applicable laws or regulations could result in 

  

in addition our failure to manage the use transportation emissions discharge storage recycling or disposal of hazardous materials could subject us to increased costs or future liabilities existing and future environmental laws and regulations could also require us to acquire pollution abatement or remediation equipment modify our product designs or incur other expenses associated with such laws and regulations many new materials that we are evaluating for use in our operations may be subject to regulation under existing or future environmental laws and regulations that may restrict our use of one or more of such materials in our manufacturing assembly and test processes or products any of these restrictions could harm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter our manufacturing and assembly and test processes 

 

climate change poses both regulatory and physical risks that could harm our results of operations or affect the way we conduct our business 

in addition to the possible direct economic impact that climate change could have on us climate change mitigation programs and regulation can increase our costs for example the cost of perfluorocompounds pfcs a gas that we use in our manufacturing could increase over time under some climatechangefocused emissions trading programs that may be imposed by government regulation if the use of pfcs is prohibited we would need to obtain substitute materials that may cost more or be less available for our manufacturing operations we also see the potential for higher energy costs driven by climate change regulations our costs could increase if utility companies pass on their costs such as those associated with carbon taxes emission cap and trade programs or renewable portfolio standards while we maintain business recovery plans that are intended to allow us to recover from natural disasters or other events that can be disruptive to our business we cannot be sure that our plans will fully protect us from all such disasters or events many of our operations are located in semiarid regions such as israel and the southwestern united states some scenarios predict that these regions may become even more vulnerable to prolonged droughts due to climate change 

 

changes in our effective tax rate may harm our results of operations 

a number of factors may increase our future effective tax rates including 

  

any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could reduce net income for future periods 

interest and other net could be harmed by macroeconomic and other factors 

factors that could cause interest and other net in our consolidated statements of income to fluctuate include 

  

our acquisitions divestitures and other transactions could disrupt our ongoing business and harm our results of operations 

in pursuing our business strategy we routinely conduct discussions evaluate opportunities and enter into agreements regarding possible investments acquisitions divestitures and other transactions such as joint ventures acquisitions and other transactions involve significant challenges and risks including risks that 

  

when we decide to sell assets or a business we may encounter difficulty in finding or completing divestiture opportunities or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner and the agreed terms and financing arrangements could be renegotiated due to changes in business or market conditions these circumstances could delay the accomplishment of our strategic objectives or cause us to incur additional expenses with respect to businesses that we want to dispose of or we may dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are less favorable than we had anticipated resulting in a loss on the transaction 

 

if we do enter into agreements with respect to acquisitions divestitures or other transactions we may fail to complete them due to 

  

further acquisitions divestitures and other transactions require substantial management resources and have the potential to divert our attention from our existing business these factors could harm our business and results of operations

information regarding the market price range of intel common stock and dividend information may be found in “financial information by quarter unaudited” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

 

in 2008 during the first quarter we paid a cash dividend of 01275 per common share and during the second third and fourth quarters we paid a cash dividend of 014 per common share for a total of 05475 for the year 01125 each quarter during 2007 for a total of 045 for the year we have paid a cash dividend in each of the past 65 quarters in january 2009 our board of directors declared a cash dividend of 014 per common share for the first quarter of 2009 the dividend is payable on march 1 2009 to stockholders of record on february 7 2009 

 

as of february 6 2009 there were approximately 180000 registered holders of record of intel’s common stock a substantially greater number of holders of intel common stock are “street name” or beneficial holders whose shares are held of record by banks brokers and other financial institutions 

 

issuer purchases of equity securities 

 

we have an ongoing authorization amended in november 2005 from our board of directors to repurchase up to 25 billion in shares of our common stock in open market or negotiated transactions as of december 27 2008 74 billion remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization a portion of our purchases in 2008 was executed under privately negotiated forward purchase agreements in the third quarter of 2008 we executed a forward purchase agreement with lehman brothers otc derivatives inc lehman brothers in which we prepaid 10 billion and received an equivalent 10 billion of cash collateral from lehman brothers however in the fourth quarter lehman brothers failed to deliver shares of intel common stock and we foreclosed on the 10 billion collateral 

 

common stock repurchases under our authorized plan in each quarter of 2008 were as follows in millions except per share amounts 

 

 

 

we did not make any common stock repurchases under our authorized plan during the fourth quarter of 2008 

 

for the majority of restricted stock units granted the number of shares issued on the date the restricted stock units vest is net of the statutory withholding requirements that we pay on behalf of our employees these withheld shares are not included in the common stock repurchase totals in the tables above for further discussion see “note 20 common stock repurchases” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k

the various sections of this mda contain a number of forwardlooking statements words such as “expects” “goals” “plans” “believes” “continues” “may” and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forwardlooking statements in addition any statements that refer to projections of our future financial performance our anticipated growth and trends in our businesses and other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forwardlooking statements such statements are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risk factors described throughout this filing and particularly in the “business outlook” section see also “risk factors” in part i item 1a of this form 10k our actual results may differ materially and these forwardlooking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any divestitures mergers acquisitions or other business combinations that had not been completed as of february 18 2009 

 

overview 

 

our goal is to be the preeminent provider of semiconductor chips and platforms for the worldwide digital economy our primary componentlevel products include microprocessors chipsets and flash memory 

 

net revenue gross margin operating income and net income for 2008 and 2007 were as follows 

 

 

 

the slowing of the worldwide economy resulted in a weak fourth quarter the pace of the revenue decline in the fourth quarter was dramatic and resulted from reduced demand and inventory contraction across the supply chain the 19 sequential decline from the third quarter of 2008 to the fourth quarter of 2008 was only the second time in the last 20 years that our fourthquarter revenue fell below our thirdquarter revenue it is unclear when a turnaround may occur and there remains a high degree of uncertainty around demand which may continue to decline however we believe that our competitive position manufacturing process technologies cash flow from operations and balance sheet remain strong and that we are well positioned to manage through this economic downturn 

 

we continue to invest in our leadingedge technologies and growth initiatives in order to strengthen our competitive position and enter new market segments we have a strong belief that technology companies successfully emerge from recessions with tomorrow’s products not today’s products in 2008 we introduced the intel atom processor family which is designed to enable new mobile internet form factors at attractive system price points our product offerings continue to strengthen with the launch of our new microarchitecture codenamed “nehalem” in the fourth quarter of 2008 additionally we expect to begin manufacturing products using our nextgeneration 32nm process technology in the second half of 2009 which we believe will increase performance and energy efficiency and lower product costs

our gross margin toward the end of the year was impacted by approximately 250 million of factory underutilization charges as well as inventory writeoffs on computingrelated products which were primarily demandrelated the underutilization charges were a result of our decision to reduce factory loadings at the end of the fourth quarter in response to the dropoff in demand as a result factory underutilization charges are expected to increase significantly in the first quarter impacting our gross margin we also expect our gross margin to be negatively impacted as our startup costs associated with our 32nm process technology increase and as we transition 32nm design resources from research and development to manufacturing additionally changes in demand levels and pricing of products could impact inventory writeoffs mix and unit costs creating additional variability in margin despite reducing our factory loadings we increased our inventory in the fourth quarter of 2008 due to lower than expected demand and inventory reductions in the supply chain we expect further reduction in the supply chain inventory levels in the first quarter of 2009 as our customers manage their business through the current economic uncertainty subsequent to the end of 2008 management approved plans to restructure some of our manufacturing and assembly and test operations and align our manufacturing and assembly and test capacity to current market conditions these actions which are expected to take place beginning in 2009 include closing two assembly and test facilities in malaysia one facility in the philippines and one facility in china stopping production at a 200mm wafer fabrication facility in oregon and ending production at our 200mm wafer fabrication facility in california 

 

we continue to focus on our commitment to efficiency and controlling spending we have reduced our headcount by over 2000 from the end of 2007 and nearly 20000 from our highest levels during 2006 during 2008 we had additional divestitures of nonstrategic businesses and divested our nor flash memory business also in a joint decision with micron we discontinued the supply of nand flash memory from a 200mm facility within the imft manufacturing network which resulted in restructuring charges of 215 million 

 

in the fourth quarter of 2008 we made a 10 billion investment in clearwire llc adding to our preexisting investments however we recorded an impairment of our investments in the new clearwire corporation and clearwire llc of 938 million primarily due to the fair value being significantly lower than the cost basis of our investments 

 

from a financial condition perspective we ended 2008 with an investment portfolio valued at 145 billion consisting of cash and cash equivalents and marketable debt instruments included in trading assets and short and longterm investments in addition we generated 109 billion in cash from operations in 2008 the credit quality of our investment portfolio remains high during this difficult credit environment with otherthantemporary impairments on our availableforsale investments in debt instruments limited to 44 million during 2008 in addition we continue to be able to invest in highquality investments however we have seen a reduction in the volume of available commercial paper from certain market segments as a result our investments in shortterm government funds have increased which will reduce our average investment return despite the tightening of the credit markets we continue to be able to access funds through the credit markets including through the issuance of commercial paper with the exception of a limited amount of investments for which we have recognized otherthantemporary impairments we have not seen significant liquidation delays and for those that have matured we have received the full par value of our original debt investments for additional details on our investment portfolio see “liquidity and capital resources” 

 

during 2008 we repurchased 71 billion of stock through our stock repurchase program and paid 31 billion to stockholders as dividends in the fourth quarter of 2008 we did not repurchase additional stock as we felt that it was better to conserve cash given the economic environment in january 2009 our board of directors declared a dividend of 014 per common share for the first quarter of 2009 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

strategy 

 

our goal is to be the preeminent provider of semiconductor chips and platforms for the worldwide digital economy as part of our overall strategy to compete in each relevant market segment we use our core competencies in the design and manufacture of integrated circuits as well as our financial resources global presence and brand recognition we believe that we have the scale capacity and global reach to establish new technologies and respond to customers’ needs quickly 

 

some of our key focus areas are listed below 

  

we believe that the proliferation of the internet including user demand for premium content and rich media drives the need for greater performance in pcs and servers a growing number of older pcs are increasingly incapable of handling the tasks that users demand such as streaming video uploading photos and online gaming as these tasks become even more demanding and require more computing power we believe that users will need and want to buy new pcs to perform everyday tasks on the internet we also believe that increased internet traffic creates a need for greater server infrastructure including server products optimized for energyefficient performance 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

the trend of mobile microprocessor unit growth outpacing the growth in desktop microprocessor units has continued and shipments of our mobile microprocessors exceeded our desktop microprocessors for the first time in the second quarter of 2008 we believe that the demand for mobile microprocessors will result in the increased development of products with form factors and uses that require lowpower microprocessors 

 

our silicon and manufacturing technology leadership allows us to develop lowpower microprocessors for new uses and form factors we believe that these lowpower microprocessors give us the ability to extend intel architecture and drive growth in new market segments including a growing number of products that require processors specifically designed for embedded solutions mids consumer electronics devices nettops and netbooks we believe that the common elements for products in these new market segments are low power consumption and the ability to access the internet we also offer and are continuing to develop soc products that integrate core processing functionality with specific components such as graphics audio and video onto a single chip to form a purposebuilt solution this integration reduces cost power consumption and size 

 

strategy by operating segment 

 

we completed a reorganization in the second quarter of 2008 that transferred the revenue and costs associated with a portion of the digital home group’s consumer pc components business to the digital enterprise group the digital home group now focuses on the consumer electronics components business the strategy by operating segment presented below is based on the new organizational structure

the strategy for our software and services group is to promote intel architecture as the platform of choice for software and services ssg works with the worldwide software and services ecosystem by providing software products engaging with developers and driving strategic software investments 

 

critical accounting estimates 

 

the methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our financial statements some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain our most critical accounting estimates include 

  

below we discuss these policies further as well as the estimates and judgments involved we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies such as those for revenue recognition including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors however these policies typically do not require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 

 

nonmarketable equity investments 

 

the carrying value of our nonmarketable equity investment portfolio excluding equity derivatives totaled 41 billion as of december 27 2008 34 billion as of december 29 2007 the majority of the balance as of december 27 2008 was concentrated in companies in the flash memory market segment and wireless connectivity market segment our flash memory market segment investments include our investment in imft of 17 billion 22 billion as of december 29 2007 our investment in im flash singapore llp imfs of 329 million 146 million as of december 29 2007 and our investment in numonyx of 484 million our wireless connectivity market segment investments include our nonmarketable investment in clearwire llc of 238 million see “note 5 availableforsale investments” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k for information on our additional marketable equity investment in the new clearwire corporation of 148 million in addition we regularly invest in nonmarketable equity instruments of private companies which range from earlystage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models for additional information see “note 6 equity method and cost method investments” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

 

our nonmarketable equity investments are recorded using adjusted historical cost basis or the equity method of accounting depending on the facts and circumstances of each investment see “note 2 accounting policies” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k our nonmarketable equity investments are classified in other longterm assets on the consolidated balance sheets 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

nonmarketable equity investments are inherently risky and a number of the companies in which we invest are likely to fail their success is dependent on product development market acceptance operational efficiency and other key business factors depending on their future prospects the companies may not be able to raise additional funds when needed or they may receive lower valuations with less favorable investment terms than in previous financings and our investments would likely become impaired additionally the current financial markets are extremely volatile and there has been a tightening of the credit markets which could negatively affect the prospects of the companies we invest in their ability to raise additional capital and the likelihood of our being able to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings mergers and private sales for further information about our investment portfolio risks including those specific to our investments in the flash memory market segment and wireless connectivity market segment see “risk factors” in part i item 1a of this form 10k 

 

we review our investments quarterly for indicators of impairment however for nonmarketable equity investments the impairment analysis requires significant judgment to identify events or circumstances that would significantly harm the fair value of the investment the indicators that we use to identify those events or circumstances primarily include 

  

investments that we identify as having an indicator of impairment are subject to further analysis to determine if the fair value of the investment is below our carrying value if the fair value of the investment is below our carrying value we determine if the investment is other than temporarily impaired based on the severity and duration of the impairment if the investment is considered to be other than temporarily impaired we write down the investment to its fair value beginning in the first quarter of 2008 the assessment of fair value for nonmarketable investments is based on the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” sfas no 157 as amended with the exception of clearwire llc we classified our impaired nonmarketable investments as level 3 as we use unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the fair value measurement and the valuation requires management judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices and inherent lack of liquidity we classified our investment in clearwire llc as level 2 as the unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology were not significant to the fair value measurement see “note 3 fair value” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

 

impairments of nonmarketable equity investments were 12 billion in 2008 over the past 12 quarters including the fourth quarter of 2008 impairments of nonmarketable equity investments have ranged from 10 million to 896 million per quarter 

 

the following is a discussion of the methods estimates and judgments that management uses in our analysis to determine if our nonmarketable equity investments are other than temporarily impaired 

 

imftimfs 

 

imft and imfs are variable interest entities that are designed to manufacture and sell nand products to intel and micron at manufacturing cost our nand solutions group operating segment purchases 49 of these nand products from imft and sells them to our customers as a result we generate cash flows from our investments in imft imfs and our intangible assets related to the nand product designs through our nand solutions group business therefore we determine the fair value of our investments in imft and imfs using the income approach based on a weighted average of multiple discounted cash flow scenarios of our nand solutions group business 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

the discounted cash flow scenarios require the use of unobservable inputs including assumptions of projected revenues including product volume product mix and average selling prices expenses capital spending and other costs as well as a discount rate estimates of projected revenues expenses capital spending and other costs are developed by imft imfs and intel using historical data and available market data management also determines how multiple discounted cash flow scenarios are weighted in the fair value determination additionally the development of several inputs used in our income model such as discount rate and tax rate requires the selection of comparable companies within the nand flash memory market segment the selection of comparable companies requires management judgment and is based on a number of factors including nand products and services lines within the flash memory market segment comparable companies’ sizes growth rates and other relevant factors based on our fair value determination the fair value of our investment in imft and imfs approximated carrying value as of december 27 2008 

 

changes in management estimates to the unobservable inputs would change the valuation of the investment the estimates for the projected revenue and discount rate are the assumptions that most significantly affect the fair value determination for example the impact of a 5 decline in projected revenue in each of our cash flow scenarios could result in a decline in the fair value of our investment of up to approximately 300 million the impact of a one percentage point increase in the discount rate would result in a decline in the fair value of our investment of approximately 225 million 

 

the fair value determined by the income approach is compared to the carrying value of our investments in imft and imfs and our intangible asset related to the nand product designs that we purchased from micron as part of the formation of imft we did not have an otherthantemporary impairment on our investments in imft and imfs in 2008 2007 or 2006 

 

numonyx 

 

we determine the fair value of our investment in numonyx using a combination of the income approach and the market approach the income approach includes the use of a weighted average of multiple discounted cash flow scenarios of numonyx which requires the use of unobservable inputs including assumptions of projected revenues expenses capital spending and other costs as well as a discount rate calculated based on the risk profile of the flash memory market segment estimates of projected revenues expenses capital spending and other costs are developed by numonyx and intel the market approach includes using financial metrics and ratios of comparable public companies such as projected revenues expenses and other costs the selection of comparable companies used in the market approach requires management judgment and is based on a number of factors including nor products and services lines within the flash memory market segment comparable companies’ sizes growth rates and other relevant factors 

 

changes in management estimates to the unobservable inputs in our valuation models would change the valuation of the investment the estimated projected revenue is the assumption that most significantly affects the fair value determination for example the impact of a 5 decline in projected revenue to each of our models and cash flow scenarios could result in a decline in the fair value of our investment of up to approximately 140 million management judgment is involved in determining how the income approach and the market approach are weighted in the fair value determination our fair value determination was more heavily weighted toward the market approach due to the comparability of similar companies in the market and the availability of marketbased data increasing the relative weighting of the income approach would have resulted in a decline in the fair value of our investment by approximately 30 million 

 

we recorded a 250 million impairment charge on our investment in numonyx during the third quarter of 2008 to write down our investment to its fair value estimates for revenue earnings and future cash flows were revised lower due to a general decline in the nor flash memory market segment 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

clearwire llc 

 

we determine the fair value of our investment in clearwire llc primarily using the quoted prices of its parent company the new clearwire corporation the effects of adjusting the quoted price for premiums that we believe market participants would consider for clearwire llc such as tax benefits and voting rights associated with our investment were mostly offset by the effects of discounts to the fair value such as those due to transfer restrictions lack of liquidity and differences in dividend rights that are included in the value of the new clearwire corporation stock during the fourth quarter of 2008 we recorded a 762 million impairment charge on our investment in clearwire llc to write down our investment to its fair value primarily due to the fair value being significantly lower than the cost basis of our investment 

 

in addition during the fourth quarter of 2008 we recorded a 176 million impairment charge on our availableforsale marketable investment in the new clearwire corporation due to the fair value being significantly lower than the cost basis of our investment 

 

other nonmarketable equity investments 

 

we determine the fair value of our other nonmarketable equity investments using the market approach andor the income approach the market approach includes the use of financial metrics and ratios of comparable public companies the selection of comparable companies requires management judgment and is based on a number of factors including comparable companies’ sizes growth rates products and services lines development stage and other relevant factors the income approach includes the use of a discounted cash flow model which requires the following significant estimates for the investee revenue based on assumed market segment size and assumed market segment share estimated costs and appropriate discount rates based on the risk profile of comparable companies estimates of market segment size market segment share and costs are developed by the investee andor intel using historical data and available market data the valuation of our other nonmarketable investments also takes into account movements of the equity and venture capital markets recent financing activities by the investees changes in the interest rate environment the investee’s capital structure liquidation preferences for the investee’s capital and other economic variables the valuation of some of our investments in the wireless connectivity market segment was based on the income approach to determine the value of the investee’s spectrum licenses transmission towers and customer lists 

 

we recorded a total of 200 million of impairment charges in 2008 on our other nonmarketable equity investments over the past 12 quarters including the fourth quarter of 2008 impairments of our other nonmarketable equity investments have ranged from 10 million to 134 million per quarter 

 

investments in debt instruments 

 

fair value 

 

in the current market environment the assessment of the fair value of debt instruments can be difficult and subjective the volume of trading activity of certain debt instruments has declined and the rapid changes occurring in today’s financial markets can lead to changes in the fair value of financial instruments in relatively short periods of time sfas no 157 establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value see “note 3 fair value” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k each level of input has different levels of subjectivity and difficulty involved in determining fair value 

 

level 1 instruments represent quoted prices in active markets therefore determining fair value for level 1 instruments does not require significant management judgment and the estimation is not difficult 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

level 2 instruments include observable inputs other than level 1 prices such as quoted prices for identical instruments in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions less active markets issuer credit ratings nonbinding market consensus prices that can be corroborated with observable market data modelderived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities or quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities these level 2 instruments require more management judgment and subjectivity compared to level 1 instruments including 

  

level 3 instruments include unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of fair value of assets or liabilities the determination of fair value for level 3 instruments requires the most management judgment and subjectivity most of our marketable debt instruments classified as level 3 are valued using a nonbinding market consensus price or a nonbinding broker quote both of which we corroborate with unobservable data nonbinding market consensus prices are based on the proprietary valuation models of pricing providers or brokers these valuation models incorporate a number of inputs including nonbinding and binding broker quotes observable market prices for identical andor similar securities and the internal assumptions of pricing providers or brokers that use observable market inputs and to a lesser degree nonobservable market inputs adjustments to the fair value of instruments priced using nonbinding market consensus prices and nonbinding broker quotes and classified as level 3 were not significant in 2008 

 

otherthantemporary impairment 

 

after determining the fair value of our availableforsale debt instruments gains or losses on these investments are recorded to other comprehensive income until either the investment is sold or we determine that the decline in value is otherthantemporary determining whether the decline in fair value is otherthantemporary requires management judgment based on the specific facts and circumstances of each investment for investments in debt instruments these judgments primarily consider the financial condition and liquidity of the issuer the issuer’s credit rating and any specific events that may cause us to believe that the debt instrument will not mature and be paid in full and our ability and intent to hold the investment to maturity given the current market conditions these judgments could prove to be wrong and companies with relatively high credit ratings and solid financial conditions may not be able to fulfill their obligations in addition if management decides not to hold an investment until maturity it may result in the recognition of an otherthantemporary impairment 

 

as of december 27 2008 our investments included 113 billion of availableforsale debt instruments during 2008 we recognized 44 million in impairment charges on our availableforsale debt instruments as of december 27 2008 our cumulative unrealized losses related to debt instruments classified as availableforsale were approximately 215 million approximately 55 million as of december 29 2007 as of december 27 2008 this amount included approximately 170 million of unrecognized losses that could be recognized in the future if our otherthantemporary assessment changes 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

longlived assets 

 

we assess the impairment of longlived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant underperformance of a business or product line in relation to expectations significant negative industry or economic trends and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets we measure the recoverability of assets that will continue to be used in our operations by comparing the carrying value of the asset grouping to our estimate of the related total future undiscounted net cash flows if an asset grouping’s carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows the asset grouping is considered to be impaired the impairment is measured by comparing the difference between the asset grouping’s carrying value and its fair value based on the best information available including market prices or discounted cash flow analysis 

 

impairments of longlived assets are determined for groups of assets related to the lowest level of identifiable independent cash flows due to our asset usage model and the interchangeable nature of our semiconductor manufacturing capacity we must make subjective judgments in determining the independent cash flows that can be related to specific asset groupings in addition as we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions we must make subjective judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets primarily processspecific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements when we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated we accelerate the rate of depreciation over the assets’ new shorter useful lives over the past 12 quarters including the fourth quarter of 2008 impairments and accelerated depreciation of longlived assets ranged from 1 million to 320 million per quarter for further discussion on these asset impairment charges see “note 15 restructuring and asset impairment charges” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

 

longlived assets such as goodwill intangible assets and property plant and equipment are considered nonfinancial assets and are measured at fair value only when indicators of impairment exist the accounting and disclosure provisions of sfas no 157 are effective for these assets beginning in the first quarter of 2009 for further discussion see “note 2 accounting policies” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

 

income taxes 

 

we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes as well as the interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 

 

we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets if recovery is not likely we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable we believe that we will ultimately recover a majority of the deferred tax assets however should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely in 2008 we recorded gross additional valuation allowances of approximately 270 million primarily related to our anticipated inability to take the full tax benefit of impairment charges changes in management’s plans with respect to holding or disposing of investments could affect our future provision for taxes 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes—an interpretation of sfas no 109” and related guidance we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a twostep process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any if we determine that a tax position will more likely than not be sustained on audit the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law settled and effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 

 

inventory 

 

the valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality the determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products the estimate of future demand is compared to work in process and finished goods inventory levels to determine the amount if any of obsolete or excess inventory as of december 27 2008 we had total workinprocess inventory of 1577 million and total finished goods inventory of 1559 million the demand forecast is included in the development of our shortterm manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuation and build decisions productspecific facts and circumstances reviewed in the inventory valuation process include a review of the customer base the stage of the product life cycle of our products consumer confidence and customer acceptance of our products as well as an assessment of the selling price in relation to the product cost if our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly or if we fail to forecast the demand accurately we could be required to write off inventory which would negatively impact our gross margin

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

results of operations 

 

the following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of income data as a percentage of net revenue for the periods indicated 

 

 

 

the following graphs set forth revenue information of geographic regions for the periods indicated 

 

geographic breakdown of revenue 

 

 

our net revenue was 376 billion in 2008 a decrease of 2 compared to 2007 higher revenue from the sale of microprocessors and chipsets was more than offset by the impacts of divestitures and lower revenue from the sale of motherboards revenue from the sale of nor flash memory and cellular baseband products declined approximately 17 billion primarily as a result of divestiture of these businesses revenue in the americas region decreased 4 in 2008 compared to 2007 revenue in the asiapacific europe and japan regions remained approximately flat in 2008 compared to 2007 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

although net revenue for 2008 declined only slightly from 2007 net revenue for the fourth quarter of 2008 declined 19 from the third quarter as customers reduced inventory levels to keep pace with the dramatic decline in enduser demand that occurred over the course of the quarter it is unclear when a turnaround may occur and there remains a high degree of uncertainty around demand which may continue to decline 

 

our overall gross margin dollars for 2008 were 208 billion an increase of 940 million or 5 compared to 2007 our overall gross margin percentage increased to 555 in 2008 from 519 in 2007 the increase in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to the gross margin percentage increase in the digital enterprise group operating segment in addition our gross margin percentage increased due to the divestiture of our nor flash memory business we derived most of our overall gross margin dollars and operating profit in 2008 and 2007 from the sale of microprocessors in the digital enterprise group and mobility group operating segments see “business outlook” for a discussion of gross margin expectations 

 

our net revenue was 383 billion in 2007 an increase of 8 compared to 2006 higher microprocessor unit sales were partially offset by lower microprocessor average selling prices higher mobile chipset unit sales also contributed to the increase in net revenue lower nor flash memory revenue in 2007 compared to 2006 was mostly offset by the ramp of our nand flash memory business the decrease in nor flash memory revenue was due to a significant decline in average selling prices lower royalty revenue was offset by higher unit sales revenue in the asiapacific region increased 11 and revenue in the europe region increased 10 in 2007 compared to 2006 and revenue in the americas region and japan increased 3 in 2007 compared to 2006 

 

our overall gross margin dollars for 2007 were 199 billion an increase of 17 billion or 9 compared to 2006 our overall gross margin percentage was relatively flat at 519 in 2007 compared to 515 in 2006 the gross margin percentage increase in the digital enterprise group operating segment was mostly offset by a decrease in the gross margin percentage in the mobility group operating segment and costs associated with the ramp of our nand flash memory business we derived most of our overall gross margin dollars and operating profit in 2007 and 2006 from the sale of microprocessors in the digital enterprise group and mobility group operating segments 

 

digital enterprise group 

 

the revenue and operating income for the digital enterprise group deg for the three years ended december 27 2008 were as follows 

 

 

 

net revenue for the deg operating segment decreased by 672 million or 3 in 2008 compared to 2007 microprocessors within deg include those designed for the desktop and enterprise computing market segments as well as embedded microprocessors the increase in microprocessor revenue was due to higher enterprise microprocessor average selling prices and higher embedded microprocessor unit sales partially offset by lower desktop microprocessor unit sales the decrease in chipset motherboard and other revenue was primarily due to lower motherboard unit sales and lower revenue from the sale of communications products in addition lower chipset average selling prices were partially offset by higher chipset unit sales 

 

operating income increased by 12 billion or 22 in 2008 compared to 2007 the increase in operating income was primarily due to lower desktop microprocessor and chipset unit costs lower startup costs of approximately 350 million and lower operating expenses were partially offset by sales in 2007 of desktop microprocessors that had previously been written off and higher writeoffs of desktop microprocessor inventory in 2008 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

for 2007 net revenue for the deg operating segment increased by 619 million or 3 compared to 2006 the increase in microprocessor revenue was due to higher microprocessor unit sales and higher enterprise average selling prices these increases were partially offset by lower desktop average selling prices in a competitive pricing environment the decrease in chipset motherboard and other revenue was due to lower motherboard unit sales as well as a decrease in communications infrastructure revenue which was primarily due to divestitures of certain communications infrastructure businesses that were completed in 2006 and 2007 partially offsetting these decreases was higher chipset revenue 

 

operating income increased by 20 billion or 61 in 2007 compared to 2006 the increase in operating income was primarily due to lower desktop microprocessor unit costs and lower operating expenses and to a lesser extent sales of desktop microprocessor inventory that had been previously written off partially offsetting these increases were higher chipset unit costs and approximately 500 million of higher startup costs primarily related to our 45nm process technology in 2007 we began including sharebased compensation in the computation of operating income loss for each operating segment and adjusted the 2006 operating segment results to reflect this change 

 

mobility group 

 

the revenue and operating income for the mobility group mg for the three years ended december 27 2008 were as follows 

 

 

 

net revenue for the mg operating segment increased by 967 million or 7 in 2008 compared to 2007 the increase in microprocessor revenue was due to significantly higher microprocessor unit sales which were partially offset by significantly lower microprocessor average selling prices a portion of the increase in microprocessor unit sales as well as a portion of the decrease in average selling prices was due to the ramp of intel atom processors the increase in chipset and other revenue was primarily due to significantly higher chipset unit sales which were partially offset by lower revenue from the sale of cellular baseband products we are winding down the sales from the manufacturing agreement entered into as part of the divestiture of the cellular baseband business 

 

operating income decreased by 412 million or 7 in 2008 compared to 2007 the decrease in operating income was primarily due to higher operating expenses which were partially offset by lower microprocessor unit costs 

 

for 2007 net revenue for the mg operating segment increased by 24 billion or 19 compared to 2006 the increase in microprocessor revenue was due to a significant increase in unit sales partially offset by significantly lower average selling prices the increase in chipset and other revenue was due to higher unit sales of chipsets and to a lesser extent higher revenue from sales of cellular baseband products in the fourth quarter of 2006 we sold certain assets of the business line that included application and cellular baseband processors used in handheld devices however in 2007 we continued to manufacture and sell those products as part of a manufacturing and transition services agreement 

 

operating income increased by 10 billion or 22 in 2007 compared to 2006 the increase in operating income was primarily due to higher revenue lower microprocessor unit costs were more than offset by approximately 330 million of higher startup costs primarily related to our 45nm process technology lower unit costs on wireless connectivity and cellular baseband products were offset by higher chipset unit costs operating expenses were higher in 2007 compared to 2006 however operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased in 2007 compared to 2006 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

operating expenses 

 

operating expenses for the three years ended december 27 2008 were as follows 

 

 

 

research and development rd spending was flat in 2008 compared to 2007 and decreased 118 million or 2 in 2007 compared to 2006 in 2008 compared to 2007 we had lower product development expenses resulting from our divested businesses and slightly lower profitdependent compensation these decreases were offset by higher process development costs as we transition from manufacturing startup costs related to our 45nm process technology to research and development of our nextgeneration 32nm process technology the decrease in 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily due to lower process development costs as we transitioned from rd to manufacturing using our 45nm process technology partially offset by higher profitdependent compensation 

 

marketing general and administrative marketing general and administrative expenses were flat in 2008 compared to 2007 and decreased 721 million or 12 in 2007 compared to 2006 in 2008 compared to 2007 we had higher legal expenses that were offset by lower profitdependent compensation and lower advertising expenses the decrease in 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily due to lower headcount lower sharebased compensation and lower cooperative advertising expenses partially offset by higher profitdependent compensation 

 

rd combined with marketing general and administrative expenses were 30 of net revenue in 2008 29 of net revenue in 2007 and 34 of net revenue in 2006 

 

restructuring and asset impairment charges the following table summarizes restructuring and asset impairment charges by plan for the three years ended december 27 2008 

 

 

 

we may incur additional restructuring charges in the future for employee severance and benefit arrangements and facilityrelated or other exit activities subsequent to the end of 2008 management approved plans to restructure some of our manufacturing and assembly and test operations and align our manufacturing and assembly and test capacity to current market conditions these actions which are expected to take place beginning in 2009 include closing two assembly and test facilities in malaysia one facility in the philippines and one facility in china stopping production at a 200mm wafer fabrication facility in oregon and ending production at our 200mm wafer fabrication facility in california our outlook for the first quarter of 2009 is for additional restructuring and asset impairment charges of 160 million 

 

2008 nand plan 

 

in the fourth quarter of 2008 management approved a plan with micron to discontinue the supply of nand flash memory from the 200mm facility within the imft manufacturing network the agreement resulted in a 215 million restructuring charge primarily related to the imft 200mm supply agreement the restructuring charge resulted in a reduction of our investment in imft of 184 million a cash payment to micron of 24 million and other cash payments of 7 million 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

2006 efficiency program 

 

the following table summarizes charges for the 2006 efficiency program for the three years ended december 27 2008 

 

 

 

in the third quarter of 2006 management approved several actions recommended by our structure and efficiency task force as part of a restructuring plan designed to improve operational efficiency and financial results some of these activities have involved cost savings or other actions that did not result in restructuring charges such as better utilization of assets reduced spending and organizational efficiencies the efficiency program has included targeted headcount reductions for various groups within the company which we have met through employee attrition and terminations business divestures have further reduced headcount 

 

during 2006 we completed the divestiture of three businesses for further discussion see “note 12 divestitures” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k in connection with the divestiture of certain assets of our communications and application processor business we recorded impairment charges of 103 million related to the writedown of manufacturing tools to their fair value less the cost to dispose of the assets we determined the fair value using a marketbased valuation technique in addition as a result of both this divestiture and a subsequent assessment of our worldwide manufacturing capacity operations we placed for sale our fabrication facility in colorado springs colorado this plan resulted in an impairment charge of 214 million to write down to fair value the land building and equipment asset grouping that has been principally used to support our communications and application processor business we determined the fair market value of the asset grouping using an average of the results from using the cost approach and market approach valuation techniques 

 

during 2007 we incurred an additional 54 million in asset impairment charges as a result of market conditions related to the colorado springs facility also we recorded land and building writedowns related to certain facilities in santa clara california in addition we incurred 85 million in asset impairment charges related to assets that we sold in conjunction with the divestiture of our nor flash memory business we determined the impairment charges based on the fair value less selling costs that we expected to receive upon completion of the divestiture 

 

during 2008 we incurred additional asset impairment charges related to the colorado springs facility based on market conditions also we incurred 275 million in additional asset impairment charges related to assets that we sold in conjunction with the divestiture of our nor flash memory business we determined the impairment charges using the revised fair value of the equity and note receivable that we received upon completion of the divestiture less selling costs the lower fair value was primarily a result of a decline in the outlook for the flash memory market segment for further information on this divestiture see “note 12 divestitures” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

 

the following table summarizes the restructuring and asset impairment activity for the 2006 efficiency program during 2007 and 2008 

 

 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

we recorded the additional accruals net of adjustments as restructuring and asset impairment charges the remaining accrual as of december 27 2008 was related to severance benefits that we recorded within accrued compensation and benefits 

 

from the third quarter of 2006 through the fourth quarter of 2008 we incurred a total of 16 billion in restructuring and asset impairment charges related to this program these charges included a total of 678 million related to employee severance and benefit arrangements for approximately 11900 employees of which 10800 employees had left the company as of december 27 2008 a substantial majority of these employee terminations affected employees within manufacturing information technology and marketing of the employee severance and benefit charges incurred as of december 27 2008 we had paid 621 million the restructuring and asset impairment charges also included 888 million in asset impairment charges 

 

we estimate that employee severance and benefit charges from the third quarter of 2006 to the fourth quarter of 2008 will result in gross annual savings of approximately 11 billion a portion of which we began to realize in the third quarter of 2006 we are realizing these savings within marketing general and administrative expenses cost of sales and rd 

 

sharebased compensation 

 

sharebased compensation totaled 851 million in 2008 952 million in 2007 and 14 billion in 2006 sharebased compensation was included in cost of sales and operating expenses the decrease in sharebased compensation from 2006 to 2007 was a result of fewer equity awards vesting in 2007 compared to 2006 

 

as of december 27 2008 unrecognized sharebased compensation costs and the weighted average periods over which the costs are expected to be recognized were as follows 

 

 

 

gains losses on equity method investments net 

 

net losses on equity method investments were 14 billion in 2008 compared to a net gain of 3 million in 2007 we recognized higher impairment charges and higher equity method losses in 2008 compared to 2007 impairment charges in 2008 included a 762 million impairment charge recognized on our investment in clearwire llc and a 250 million impairment charge recognized on our investment in numonyx we recognized the impairment charge on our investment in clearwire llc to write down our investment to its fair value primarily due to the fair value being significantly lower than the cost basis of our investment the impairment charge on our investment in numonyx was due to a general decline in the nor flash memory market segment our equity method losses were primarily related to numonyx 87 million in 2008 and the old clearwire corporation 184 million 2008 and 104 million in 2007 see “note 6 equity method and cost method investments” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

 

net gains on equity method investments were flat in 2007 compared to 2006 approximately 110 million of income recognized in 2007 due to the reorganization of one of our investments was offset by higher equity method losses primarily from our investment in the old clearwire corporation equity method losses were not significant in 2006 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

gains losses on other equity investments net 

 

gains losses on other equity investments net were as follows 

 

 

 

net losses on other equity investments were 376 million in 2008 compared to a net gain of 154 million in 2007 we recognized higher impairment charges and lower gains on sales in 2008 compared to 2007 impairment charges in 2008 included a 176 million impairment charge recognized on our investment in the new clearwire corporation and 97 million of impairment charges on our investment in micron the impairment charge on our investment in the new clearwire corporation was due to the fair value being significantly lower than the cost basis of our investment the impairment charges on our investment in micron reflect the difference between our cost basis and the fair value of our investment in micron at the end of the second and third quarters of 2008 and were principally based on our assessment of micron’s financial results and the competitive environment 

 

net gains on other equity investments were 154 million in 2007 compared to 212 million in 2006 during 2007 we recognized lower gains on thirdparty merger transactions and higher impairment charges partially offset by higher gains on sales of equity investments net gains on equity investments in 2006 included a gain of 103 million on the sale of a portion of our investment in micron which was sold for 275 million 

 

interest and other net 

 

the components of interest and other net were as follows 

 

 

 

interest and other net decreased to 488 million in 2008 compared to 793 million in 2007 the decrease was due to lower interest income and fair value losses that we experienced in 2008 on our trading assets interest income was lower in 2008 compared to 2007 as a result of lower interest rates partially offset by higher average investment balances 

 

interest and other net decreased to 793 million in 2007 compared to 12 billion in 2006 primarily due to lower divestiture gains partially offset by higher interest income resulting primarily from higher average investment balances and to a lesser extent higher interest rates results for 2006 included net gains of 612 million for three divestitures see “note 12 divestitures” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

 

provision for taxes 

 

our effective income tax rate was 311 in 2008 239 in 2007 and 286 in 2006 the rate increased in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to the recognition of a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of realizing tax benefits related to impairments of our equity investments in addition the rate increased in 2008 compared to 2007 due to the reversal of previously accrued taxes of 481 million including 50 million of accrued interest related to settlements with the us internal revenue service irs in the first and second quarters of 2007 our effective income tax rate was lower in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to the settlements with the irs 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

cash shortterm investments marketable debt instruments included in trading assets and debt at the end of each period were as follows 

 

 

 

in summary our cash flows were as follows 

 

 

 

operating activities 

 

cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain noncash items and changes in certain assets and liabilities for 2008 compared to 2007 the 17 billion decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the 17 billion decrease in net income while total adjustments to reconcile net income to cash provided by operating activities including net changes in assets and liabilities were approximately flat 

 

inventories as of december 27 2008 increased compared to december 29 2007 due to higher chipset and microprocessor inventories partially offset by lower inventories of other products as of december 27 2008 our other accrued liabilities included 447 million in customer credit balances which were reclassified from accounts receivable accounts receivable as of december 27 2008 decreased significantly compared to december 29 2007 due to a significant decline in revenue during the last month in the fourth quarter of 2008 customer credit balances were not significant as of december 29 2007 for 2008 our two largest customers accounted for 38 of our net revenue 35 in 2007 in 2008 one of these customers accounted for 20 of our net revenue 17 in 2007 and another customer accounted for 18 of our net revenue 18 in 2007 additionally these two largest customers accounted for 46 of our accounts receivable as of december 27 2008 35 as of december 29 2007 

 

due to the adoption of sfas no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities—including an amendment of fasb statement no 115” sfas no 159 in 2008 the related cash flows for marketable debt instruments classified as trading assets are now included in investing activities 

 

for 2007 compared to 2006 the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to higher net income changes to working capital in 2007 from 2006 were approximately flat with a decrease in inventory levels compared to an increase in 2006 offset by higher purchases of trading assets exceeding maturities 

 

investing activities 

 

investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures net investment purchases maturities and disposals 

 

the decrease in cash used for investing activities in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily due to a decrease in purchases of availableforsale debt investments in addition due to the adoption of sfas no 159 in 2008 the related cash flows for marketable debt instruments classified as trading assets were included in investing activities for 2008 and previously they had been included in operating activities our investments in nonmarketable equity investments were higher in 2008 and included 10 billion for an ownership interest in clearwire llc 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

our capital expenditures were 52 billion in 2008 50 billion in 2007 and 59 billion in 2006 capital expenditures for fiscal year 2009 are currently expected to be flat to slightly down from our 2008 expenditures capital expenditures during fiscal year 2009 are expected to be funded by cash flows from operating activities 

 

the increase in cash used in investing activities in 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily due to higher purchases of availableforsale investments lower capital spending was mostly offset by lower proceeds from divestitures 

 

financing activities 

 

financing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases and retirement of common stock payment of dividends to stockholders and proceeds from the sale of shares through employee equity incentive plans 

 

the higher cash used in financing activities in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily due to an increase in repurchases and retirement of common stock and lower proceeds from the sale of shares pursuant to employee equity incentive plans during 2008 we repurchased 72 billion of common stock compared to 28 billion in 2007 as of december 27 2008 74 billion remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization of 25 billion we base our level of common stock repurchases on internal cash management decisions and this level may fluctuate proceeds from the sale of shares through employee equity incentive plans totaled 11 billion in 2008 compared to 31 billion in 2007 as a result of a lower volume of employee exercises of stock options our dividend payment was 31 billion in 2008 higher than the 26 billion in 2007 due to increases in quarterly cash dividends per common share on january 23 2009 our board of directors declared a cash dividend of 014 per common share for the first quarter of 2009 

 

the lower cash used in financing activities in 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily due to an increase in proceeds from the sale of shares through employee equity incentive plans and a decrease in repurchases and retirement of common stock 

 

liquidity 

 

cash generated by operations is used as our primary source of liquidity as of december 27 2008 we also had an investment portfolio valued at 145 billion consisting of cash and cash equivalents and marketable debt instruments included in trading assets and short and longterm investments 

 

our investment policy requires all investments with original maturities of up to 6 months to be rated at least a1p1 by standard  poor’smoody’s and specifies a higher minimum rating for investments with longer maturities for instance investments with maturities of greater than three years require a minimum rating of aaaa3 at the time of investment government regulations imposed on investment alternatives of our nonus subsidiaries or the absence of a rated counterparties in certain countries result in some minor exceptions substantially all of our investments in debt instruments are with aa2 or better rated issuers and the majority of the issuers are rated aaaa2 or better additionally we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty based on our analysis of that counterparty’s relative credit standing as of december 27 2008 the total credit exposure to any single counterparty did not exceed 500 million 

 

credit rating criteria for derivative instruments are similar to those for other investments the amounts subject to credit risk related to derivative instruments are generally limited to the amounts if any by which a counterparty’s obligations exceed our obligations with that counterparty because we enter into master netting arrangements with counterparties when possible to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions subject to international swaps and derivatives association inc isda agreements 

 

the credit quality of our investment portfolio remains high during this difficult credit environment with otherthantemporary impairments on our availableforsale debt instruments limited to 44 million during 2008 in addition we continue to be able to invest in highquality investments however we have seen a reduction in the volume of available commercial paper from certain market segments as a result our investments in shortterm government funds have increased which will reduce our average investment return with the exception of a limited amount of investments for which we have recognized otherthantemporary impairments we have not seen significant liquidation delays and for those that have matured we have received the full par value of our original debt investments we have the intent and ability to hold our debt investments that have unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive income for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery of the principal amounts invested which may occur at or near the maturity of those investments 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

as of december 27 2008 102 billion of our portfolio had a remaining maturity of less than one year as of december 27 2008 our cumulative unrealized losses net of corresponding hedging activities related to debt instruments classified as trading assets were approximately 145 million approximately 25 million as of december 29 2007 as of december 27 2008 our cumulative unrealized losses related to debt instruments classified as availableforsale were approximately 215 million approximately 55 million as of december 29 2007 substantially all of our unrealized losses can be attributed to fair value fluctuations in an unstable credit environment that resulted in a decrease in the market liquidity for debt instruments 

 

our portfolio included 11 billion of assetbacked securities as of december 27 2008 approximately half of these securities were collateralized by firstlien mortgages or credit card debt the remaining assetbacked securities were collateralized by student loans or auto loans during 2008 our assetbacked securities experienced net unrealized fair value declines totaling 131 million of which 108 million was recognized in our consolidated statements of income as of december 27 2008 the expected weighted average remaining maturity was less than two years 

 

we continually monitor the credit risk in our portfolio and mitigate our credit and interest rate exposures in accordance with the policies approved by our board of directors we intend to continue to closely monitor future developments in the credit markets and make appropriate changes to our investment policy as deemed necessary based on our ability to liquidate our investment portfolio and our expected operating cash flows we do not anticipate any liquidity constraints as a result of either the current credit environment or potential investment fair value fluctuations 

 

our commercial paper program provides another potential source of liquidity we have an ongoing authorization from our board of directors to borrow up to 30 billion including through the issuance of commercial paper maximum borrowings under our commercial paper program during 2008 were approximately 13 billion although no commercial paper remained outstanding as of december 27 2008 our commercial paper was rated a1 by standard  poor’s and p1 by moody’s as of december 27 2008 despite the tightening of the credit markets we continue to be able to access funds through the credit markets including through the issuance of commercial paper we also have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the sec pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt equity and other securities 

 

we believe that we have the financial resources needed to meet business requirements for the next 12 months including capital expenditures for the expansion or upgrading of worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test capacity working capital requirements and potential dividends common stock repurchases and acquisitions or strategic investments 

 

fair value 

 

beginning in the first quarter of 2008 the assessment of fair value for our financial instruments was based on the provisions of sfas no 157 sfas no 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value observable inputs are obtained from independent sources and can be validated by a third party whereas unobservable inputs reflect assumptions regarding what a third party would use in pricing an asset or liability a financial instrument’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 

 

credit risk is factored into the valuation of financial instruments that we measure at fair value on a recurring basis when fair value is determined using observable market prices the credit risk is incorporated into the market price of the financial instrument when fair value is determined using pricing models such as a discounted cash flow model the issuer’s credit risk andor intel’s credit risk is factored into the calculation of the fair value as appropriate during 2008 the valuation of our liabilities measured at fair value as well as our derivative instruments in a current or potential net liability position were not impacted by changes in our credit risk the credit ratings of certain of our counterparties have deteriorated however the deterioration of these credit ratings did not have a significant impact on the valuation of either our marketable debt instruments or derivative instruments in a current or potential net asset position 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

when values are determined using inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the values of the instruments being measured we classify those instruments as level 3 under the sfas no 157 hierarchy as of december 27 2008 our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis included 150 billion of assets of which 17 billion 11 were classified as level 3 in addition our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis included 421 million of liabilities of which 147 million 35 were classified as level 3 during 2008 we transferred approximately 680 million of assets from level 3 to level 2 these assets primarily consisted of floatingrate notes that were transferred from level 3 to level 2 due to a greater availability of observable market data andor nonbinding market consensus prices to value or corroborate the value of our instruments during 2008 we recognized an insignificant amount of losses on the assets that were transferred from level 3 to level 2 

 

during 2008 the level 3 assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis experienced net unrealized fair value declines totaling 160 million of these declines 111 million was recognized in our consolidated statements of income we believe that the remaining 49 million included in other comprehensive income represents a temporary decline in the fair value of availableforsale investments during 2008 we did not experience any significant realized gains losses related to the level 3 assets or liabilities in our portfolio 

 

marketable debt instruments 

 

as of december 27 2008 our assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis included 142 billion of marketable debt instruments of these instruments approximately 525 million was classified as level 1 approximately 120 billion as level 2 and approximately 16 billion as level 3 

 

when available we use observable market prices for identical securities to value our marketable debt instruments if observable market prices are not available we use nonbinding market consensus prices that we seek to corroborate with observable market data if available or nonobservable market data when prices from multiple sources are available for a given instrument we use observable market quotes to price our instruments in lieu of prices from other sources 

 

our balance of marketable debt instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 1 was classified as such due to the usage of observable market prices for identical securities that are traded in active markets marketable debt instruments in this category generally include certain of our floatingrate notes corporate bonds and money market fund deposits management judgment was required to determine our policy that defines the levels at which sufficient volume and frequency of transactions are met for a market to be considered active our assessment of an active market for our marketable debt instruments generally takes into consideration activity during each week of the onemonth period prior to the valuation date of each individual instrument including the number of days each individual instrument trades and the average weekly trading volume in relation to the total outstanding amount of the issued instrument 

 

approximately 10 of our balance of marketable debt instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 2 was classified as such due to the usage of observable market prices for identical securities that are traded in less active markets when observable market prices for identical securities are not available we price our marketable debt instruments using nonbinding market consensus prices that are corroborated with observable market data quoted market prices for similar instruments or pricing models such as a discounted cash flow model with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data nonbinding market consensus prices are based on the proprietary valuation models of pricing providers or brokers these valuation models incorporate a number of inputs including nonbinding and binding broker quotes observable market prices for identical andor similar securities and the internal assumptions of pricing providers or brokers that use observable market inputs and to a lesser degree nonobservable market inputs we corroborate the nonbinding market consensus prices with observable market data using statistical models when observable market data exists the discounted cash flow model uses observable market inputs such as liborbased yield curves currency spot and forward rates and credit ratings approximately 45 of our balance of marketable debt instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 2 was classified as such due to the usage of a discounted cash flow model approximately 40 due to the usage of nonbinding market consensus prices that are corroborated with observable market data and approximately 5 due to the usage of quoted market prices for similar instruments marketable debt instruments classified as level 2 generally include commercial paper bank time deposits municipal bonds certain of our money market fund deposits and a majority of floatingrate notes and corporate bonds 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

our marketable debt instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and classified as level 3 were classified as such due to the lack of observable market data to corroborate either the nonbinding market consensus prices or the nonbinding broker quotes when observable market data is not available we corroborate the nonbinding market consensus prices and nonbinding broker quotes using unobservable data if available marketable debt instruments in this category generally include assetbacked securities and certain of our floatingrate notes and corporate bonds all of our investments in assetbacked securities were classified as level 3 and substantially all of them were valued using nonbinding market consensus prices that we were not able to corroborate with observable market data due to the lack of transparency in the market for assetbacked securities 

 

money market fund deposits 

 

as of december 27 2008 our marketable debt instruments included 422 million of money market fund deposits of these money market fund deposits 373 million was classified as level 1 and 49 million was classified as level 2 

 

equity securities 

 

as of december 27 2008 our portfolio of assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis included 352 million of marketable equity securities of these securities 308 million was classified as level 1 because the valuations were based on quoted prices for identical securities in active markets our assessment of an active market for our marketable equity securities generally takes into consideration activity during each week of the onemonth period prior to the valuation date for each individual security including the number of days each individual equity security trades and the average weekly trading volume in relation to the total outstanding shares of that security the fair values of our investments in the new clearwire corporation 148 million and vmware inc 137 million constituted most of the fair values of the marketable equity securities that we classified as level 1 our investment in vmware was reclassified from level 2 to level 1 during 2008 due to the expiration of our transfer restriction on vmware stock 

 

the remaining marketable equity securities 44 million were classified as level 2 because their valuations were either based on quoted prices for identical securities in less active markets or adjusted for securityspecific restrictions the fair value of our investment in micron 42 million constituted substantially all of the fair values of the marketable equity securities that we classified as level 2 in measuring the fair value of our investment in micron our valuation reflected a discount from the quoted market price of micron’s stock due to our investment being in a form of rights exchangeable into unregistered micron stock 

 

as of december 27 2008 our portfolio of assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis included 299 million of equity securities offsetting deferred compensation all of these securities were classified as level 1 because their valuations were based on quoted prices for identical securities in active markets 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

contractual obligations 

 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of december 27 2008 

 

 

 

 

  

contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services generally include agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on intel and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction the table above also includes agreements to purchase raw materials that have cancellation provisions requiring little or no payment the amounts under such contracts are included in the table above because management believes that cancellation of these contracts is unlikely and expects to make future cash payments according to the contract terms or in similar amounts for similar materials for other obligations with cancellation provisions the amounts included in the table above were limited to the noncancelable portion of the agreement terms andor the minimum cancellation fee 

 

we have entered into certain agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods that specify minimum prices and quantities based on a percentage of the total available market or based on a percentage of our future purchasing requirements due to the uncertainty of the future market and our future purchasing requirements obligations under these agreements are not included in the table above we estimate our obligation under these agreements as of december 27 2008 to be approximately as follows less than one year—309 million one to three years—315 million three to five years—zero more than five years—zero our purchase orders for other products are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons in addition some of our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

contractual obligations that are contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones are not included in the table above these obligations include milestonebased comarketing agreements contingent fundingpayment obligations and milestonebased equity investment funding these arrangements are not considered contractual obligations until the milestone is met by the third party as of december 27 2008 assuming that all future milestones are met additional required payments would be approximately 150 million 

 

for the majority of restricted stock units granted the number of shares issued on the date the restricted stock units vest is net of the statutory withholding requirements paid by intel on behalf of our employees the obligation to pay the relative taxing authority is not included in the table above as the amount is contingent upon continued employment in addition the amount of the obligation is unknown as it is based in part on the market price of our common stock when the awards vest 

 

the expected timing of payments of the obligations above are estimates based on current information timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations amounts disclosed as contingent or milestonebased obligations are dependent on the achievement of the milestones or the occurrence of the contingent events and can vary significantly 

 

we have a contractual obligation to purchase the output of imft and imfs in proportion to our investments currently 49 in each of these ventures however imfs is in its construction phase and has had no production to date see “note 6 equity method and cost method investments” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k additionally we have entered into various contractual commitments in relation to our investments in imft and imfs some of these commitments are with micron and some are directly with imft or imfs the following are the significant contractual commitments 

  

offbalancesheet arrangements 

 

as of december 27 2008 with the exception of a guarantee for the repayment of 275 million in principal of the payment obligations of numonyx under its senior credit facility as well as accrued unpaid interest expenses of the lenders and penalties we did not have any significant offbalancesheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk see “note 6 equity method and cost method investments” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

business outlook 

 

our future results of operations and the topics of other forwardlooking statements contained in this form 10k including this mda involve a number of risks and uncertainties—in particular current economic uncertainty including the tightening of credit markets as well as future economic conditions our goals and strategies new product introductions plans to cultivate new businesses divestitures or investments revenue pricing gross margin and costs capital spending depreciation rd expenses marketing general and administrative expenses potential impairment of investments our effective tax rate pending legal proceedings net gains losses from equity investments and interest and other net the current uncertainty in global economic conditions makes it particularly difficult to predict product demand and other related matters and makes it more likely that our actual results could differ materially from our expectations in addition to the various important factors discussed above a number of other important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations see the risks described in “risk factors” in part i item 1a of this form 10k 

 

our expectations for 2009 are as follows 

  

status of business outlook 

 

we expect that our corporate representatives will from time to time meet privately with investors investment analysts the media and others and may reiterate the forwardlooking statements contained in the “business outlook” section and elsewhere in this form 10k including any such statements that are incorporated by reference in this form 10k at the same time we will keep this form 10k and our most current business outlook publicly available on our investor relations web site at wwwintccom  the public can continue to rely on the business outlook published on the web site as representing our current expectations on matters covered unless we publish a notice stating otherwise the statements in the “business outlook” and other forwardlooking statements in this form 10k are subject to revision during the course of the year in our quarterly earnings releases and sec filings and at other times 

 

from the close of business on february 27 2009 until our quarterly earnings release is published presently scheduled for april 14 2009 we will observe a “quiet period” during the quiet period the “business outlook” and other forwardlooking statements first published in our form 8k filed on january 15 2009 as reiterated or updated as applicable in this form 10k should be considered historical speaking as of prior to the quiet period only and not subject to update during the quiet period our representatives will not comment on our business outlook or our financial results or expectations the exact timing and duration of the routine quiet period and any others that we utilize from time to time may vary at our discretion

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

we are exposed to financial market risks primarily changes in currency exchange rates interest rates and equity prices we use derivative financial instruments primarily to manage currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk and to a lesser extent equity market risk and commodity price risk all of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial positions as of december 27 2008 and december 29 2007 actual results may differ materially 

 

currency exchange rates 

 

we generally hedge currency risks of nonusdollardenominated investments in debt instruments with offsetting currency borrowings currency forward contracts or currency interest rate swaps gains and losses on these nonuscurrency investments would generally be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments resulting in a negligible net exposure 

 

a majority of our revenue expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars however certain operating expenditures and capital purchases are incurred in or exposed to other currencies primarily the euro the japanese yen and the israeli shekel we have established balance sheet and forecasted transaction currency risk management programs to protect against fluctuations in fair value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in exchange rates we generally utilize currency forward contracts and to a lesser extent currency options in these hedging programs our hedging programs reduce but do not always entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements see “risk factors” in part i item 1a of this form 10k we considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that a weighted average adverse change of 20 in currency exchange rates could be experienced in the near term such an adverse change after taking into account hedges and offsetting positions would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before taxes of less than 55 million at the end of 2008 less than 35 million at the end of 2007 using a weighted average adverse change of 15 in currency exchange rates the weighted average adverse change increased from the end of 2007 to the end of 2008 due to a higher relative weighting of more volatile currencies 

 

interest rates 

 

we are exposed to interest rate risk related to our investment portfolio and debt issuances the primary objective of our investments in debt instruments is to preserve principal while maximizing yields to achieve this objective the returns on our investments in debt instruments are generally based on threemonth libor or if the maturities are longer than three months the returns are generally swapped into us dollar threemonth liborbased returns the current financial markets are extremely volatile a hypothetical 10 decrease in interest rates after taking into account hedges and offsetting positions would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our net investment position of approximately 135 million as of december 27 2008 and 80 million as of december 29 2007 the hypothetical 10 interest rate decrease would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our debt issuances of approximately 150 million as of december 27 2008 and would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our investment portfolio of approximately 15 million as of december 27 2008 an increase in the fair value of our debt issuances of approximately 95 million as of december 29 2007 and an increase in the fair value of our investment portfolio of approximately 15 million as of december 29 2007 the fluctuations in fair value of our debt issuances and investment portfolio reflect only the direct impact of the change in interest rates other economic variables such as equity market fluctuations and changes in relative credit risk could result in a significantly higher decline in our net investment portfolio for further information on how credit risk is factored into the valuation of our investment portfolio and debt issuances see “fair value” in part ii item 7 of this form 10k 

 

equity prices 

 

our marketable equity investments include marketable equity securities and equity derivative instruments such as warrants and options to the extent that our marketable equity securities have strategic value we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our equity market exposure through hedging activities however for our investments in strategic equity derivative instruments including warrants we may enter into transactions to reduce or eliminate the equity market risks for securities that we no longer consider strategic we evaluate legal market and economic factors in our decision on the timing of disposal and whether it is possible and appropriate to hedge the equity market risk 

the marketable equity securities included in trading assets are held to generate returns that seek to offset changes in liabilities related to the equity and other market risks of certain deferred compensation arrangements the gains and losses from changes in fair value of these equity securities are offset by the gains and losses on the related liabilities assuming a decline in market prices of approximately 25 our net exposure to loss was approximately 40 million as of december 27 2008 and approximately 20 million as of december 29 2007 

 

as of december 27 2008 the fair value of our availableforsale marketable equity securities and our equity derivative instruments including hedging positions was 362 million 10 billion as of december 29 2007 our investments in the new clearwire corporation vmware and micron constituted 90 of our marketable equity securities as of december 27 2008 and were carried at a fair market value of 148 million 137 million and 42 million respectively the current equity markets are extremely volatile assuming a loss of 60 in market prices and after reflecting the impact of hedges and offsetting positions the aggregate value of our marketable equity investments could decrease by approximately 220 million based on the value as of december 27 2008 a decrease in value of 565 million based on the value as of december 29 2007 using an assumed loss of 55 the increase in the assumed loss percentage from december 29 2007 to december 27 2008 is due to a higher relative weighting of more volatile investments 

 

many of the same factors that could result in an adverse movement of equity market prices affect our nonmarketable equity investments although we cannot always quantify the impact directly the current financial markets are extremely volatile and there has been a tightening of the credit markets which could negatively affect the prospects of the companies we invest in their ability to raise additional capital and the likelihood of our being able to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings mergers and private sales these types of investments involve a great deal of risk and there can be no assurance that any specific company will grow or become successful consequently we could lose all or part of our investment our nonmarketable equity investments excluding investments accounted for under the equity method had a carrying amount of 10 billion as of december 27 2008 805 million as of december 29 2007 as of december 27 2008 the carrying amount of our nonmarketable equity method investments was 30 billion 26 billion as of december 29 2007 most of the balance as of december 27 2008 was concentrated in companies in the flash memory market segment and wireless connectivity market segment our flash memory market segment investments include our investment of 17 billion in imft 22 billion as of december 29 2007 329 million in imfs 146 million as of december 29 2007 and 484 million in numonyx our wireless connectivity market segment investments include our nonmarketable equity method investment in clearwire llc of 238 million see “note 6 equity method and cost method investments” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k

 item 9a controls and procedures tableend  

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

 

based on management’s evaluation with the participation of our ceo and chief financial officer cfo as of the end of the period covered by this report our ceo and cfo have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the exchange act are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in sec rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

 

there were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

 

management report on internal control over financial reporting 

 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 

 

management assessed our internal control over financial reporting as of december 27 2008 the end of our fiscal year management based its assessment on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission management’s assessment included evaluation of elements such as the design and operating effectiveness of key financial reporting controls process documentation accounting policies and our overall control environment 

 

based on our assessment management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the fiscal year to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles we reviewed the results of management’s assessment with the audit committee of our board of directors 

 

our independent registered public accounting firm ernst  young llp independently assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting ernst  young has issued an attestation report concurring with management’s assessment which is included at the end of part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

 

inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

 

our management including the ceo and cfo does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures

we offer features to improve microprocessor capabilities that can enhance system performance and user experience for example we offer intel ® active management technology intel ® amt which helps information technology managers diagnose fix and protect enabled systems that are plugged into a power source and connected to a network even if a computer is turned off or has a failed hard drive or operating system we also offer intel ® virtualization technology intel ® vt which can enable a single computer system to function as multiple virtual systems by running multiple operating systems and applications thereby consolidating workloads and providing increased security and management capabilities in addition our intel ® core tm microarchitecture includes other features that can increase performance and energy efficiency to take advantage of these features a computer system must have a microprocessor that supports a chipset and bios basic inputoutput system that use and software that is optimized for the technology performance will vary depending on the system hardware and software used 

we offer platforms that incorporate various components and technologies a platform typically includes a microprocessor chipset and enabling software and may include additional hardware services and support in developing our platforms we may include components made by other companies a component is one of any number of software or hardware features that may be incorporated into a computer handheld device or other computing system including a microprocessor chipset motherboard memory wired or wireless connectivity device or software we refer to the platform brands within our product offerings as processor technologies 

 

we strive to design computing and communications systems and devices with improved overall performance andor improved energyefficient performance improved overall performance can include faster processing performance and other improved capabilities such as multithreading and multitasking performance can also be improved through enhanced connectivity security manageability utilization reliability ease of use and interoperability among devices improved energyefficient performance involves balancing the addition of improved performance factors with lower power consumption lower power consumption may reduce system heat output thereby providing power savings and reducing the total cost of ownership for the user 

 

following is detailed information on our major product categories 

 

a microprocessor is the central processing unit cpu of a computer system it processes system data and controls other devices in the system acting as the “brains” of the computer the following characteristics of a microprocessor may affect overall performance 

  

the chipset operates as the pc’s “nervous system” sending data between the microprocessor and input display and storage devices such as the keyboard mouse monitor hard drive and cd or dvd drive chipsets perform essential logic functions such as balancing the performance of the system and removing bottlenecks chipsets also extend the graphics audio video and other capabilities of many systems based on our microprocessors finally chipsets control the access between the cpu and main memory 

 

a motherboard is the principal board within a system a motherboard has connectors for attaching devices to the bus and typically contains the cpu memory and the chipset 

 

flash memory is a specialized type of memory component used to store user data and program code it retains this information even when the power is off and provides faster access to data than traditional hard drives flash memory has no moving parts unlike devices such as rapidly spinning disk drives allowing flash memory to be more tolerant of bumps and shocks flash memory is based on either nor or nand architecture nor flash memory with its fast access or “read” capabilities has traditionally been used to store executable code nand flash memory which is slower in reading data but faster in writing data has become the preferred flash memory for storing large quantities of data 

wired and wireless internet connectivity products such as network adapters and embedded wireless cards are based on industrystandard technologies used to translate and transmit data in packets across networks our wireless connectivity products are based on either the 80211 or 80216 industry standard the 80211 communication standard refers to a family of specifications commonly known as wifi technology we also have developed and are developing wireless connectivity products for both mobile and fixed networks based on the 80216 industry standard commonly known as wimax which is short for worldwide interoperability for microwave access wimax is a standardsbased wireless technology providing highspeed broadband connectivity that makes it possible to connect users to networks wirelessly as well as networks to other networks up to several miles apart 

 

communications infrastructure products include advanced programmable processors used in networking equipment that rapidly manage and direct data moving across the internet and networks our modular communications platforms are based on telecommunications industry standards such as carrier grade allowing communications and media services to be managed independently from the network itself unlike proprietary systems platforms carriergrade rackmount servers based on our modular communications platforms are standardsbased solutions that offer network infrastructure builders flexible lowcost lowpowerconsumption options for designing their networks

manufacturing and assembly and test 

 

as of december 29 2007 73 of our wafer fabrication including microprocessor chipset nor flash memory communications and other silicon fabrication was conducted within the us at our facilities in arizona new mexico oregon massachusetts and california the remaining 27 of our wafer fabrication was conducted outside the us at our facilities in ireland and israel 

 

as of december 29 2007 we primarily manufactured our products in wafer fabrication facilities at the following locations 

 

 

 

we expect to increase the capacity of certain facilities listed above through additional investments in capital equipment in addition to our current facilities we are building a facility in israel that is expected to begin wafer fabrication for microprocessors on 300mm wafers using 45nm process technology in the second half of 2008 also we are building a 300mm wafer fabrication facility in china that is expected to begin production in 2010 

 

as of december 29 2007 the majority of our microprocessors were manufactured on 300mm wafers using our 65nm process technology in 2007 we started manufacturing microprocessors using our new 45nm process technology which enables higher and more energyefficient processor performance the benefits of moving to each succeeding generation of manufacturing process technology can include using less space per transistor reducing heat output from each transistor andor increasing the number of integrated features on each chip these advancements can result in microprocessors that are higher performing consume less power andor cost less to manufacture 

 

to augment capacity we use thirdparty manufacturing companies foundries to manufacture wafers for certain components including chipset networking and communications products in addition we primarily use subcontractors to manufacture boardlevel products and systems and purchase certain communications networking products from external vendors principally in the asiapacific region 

 

our nand flash memory products are manufactured by imft a nand flash memory manufacturing company that we formed with micron technology inc in 2006 we currently purchase 49 of the manufactured output of imft see “note 19 ventures” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

 

following the manufacturing process the majority of our components are subject to assembly and test we perform our components assembly and test at facilities in malaysia china the philippines and costa rica we plan to continue investing in new assembly and test technologies as well as increasing the capacity of our existing facilities and building new facilities to keep pace with our microprocessor chipset and communications technology improvements in line with these plans we are building a new assembly and test facility in vietnam which is expected to begin production in 2009 this facility will have greater square footage than each of our current facilities which will enable us to take advantage of greater economies of scale to augment capacity we use subcontractors to perform assembly of certain products primarily flash memory chipsets and networking and communications products assembly and test of nand flash memory products manufactured by imft is performed by micron and other external subcontractors 

 

our employment practices are consistent with and we expect our suppliers and subcontractors to abide by local country law in addition we impose a minimum employee age requirement as well as progressive environmental health and safety requirements regardless of local law 

 

we have thousands of suppliers including subcontractors providing our various materials and service needs we set expectations for supplier performance and reinforce those expectations with periodic assessments we communicate those expectations to our suppliers regularly and work with them to implement improvements when necessary we seek where possible to have several sources of supply for all of these materials and resources but we may rely on a single or limited number of suppliers or upon suppliers in a single country in those cases we develop and implement plans and actions to reduce the exposure that would result from a disruption in supply we have entered into longterm contracts with certain suppliers to ensure a portion of our silicon supply 

our products typically are produced at multiple intel facilities at various sites around the world or by subcontractors who have multiple facilities however some products are produced in only one intel or subcontractor facility and we seek to implement actions and plans to reduce the exposure that would result from a disruption at any such facility see “risk factors” in part i item 1a of this form 10k 

 

research and development 

 

we are committed to investing in worldclass technology development particularly in the area of the design and manufacture of integrated circuits research and development rd expenditures in 2007 were 58 billion 59 billion in fiscal year 2006 and 51 billion in fiscal year 2005 

 

our rd activities are directed toward developing the technology innovations that we believe will deliver our next generation of products and platforms which will in turn enable new form factors and new usage models for businesses and consumers our rd activities range from design and development of products to developing and refining manufacturing processes as well as researching future technologies and products 

 

we are focusing our rd efforts on advanced computing communications and wireless technologies as well as energy efficiency by developing new microarchitectures advancing our silicon manufacturing process technology delivering the next generation of microprocessors and chipsets improving our platform initiatives and developing software solutions and tools to support our technologies our rd efforts enable new levels of performance and address areas such as scalability for multicore architectures system manageability and security energy efficiency digital content protection ease of use and new communications capabilities in the area of wireless communications our initiatives focus on delivering the technologies that will enable improved wireless capabilities including expanding and proliferating wimax technologies and products 

 

as part of our rd efforts we plan to introduce a new microarchitecture for our mobile desktop and intel xeon processors approximately every two years and ramp the next generation of silicon process technology in the intervening years we refer to this as our “ticktock” technology development cadence our leadership in silicon technology has enabled us to make “moore’s law” a reality moore’s law predicted that transistor density on integrated circuits would double about every two years our leadership in silicon technology has also helped to expand on the advances anticipated by moore’s law by bringing new capabilities into silicon and producing new products and platforms optimized for a wider variety of applications in 2007 we started manufacturing microprocessors on our new 45nm hik metal gate silicon technology and we expect to introduce a new microarchitecture on 45nm process technology in 2008 we are currently developing 32nm process technology our nextgeneration process technology and expect to begin manufacturing products using that technology in 2009 

 

our rd model is based on a global organization that emphasizes a collaborative approach in identifying and developing new technologies leading standards initiatives and influencing regulatory policy to accelerate the adoption of new technologies our rd initiatives are performed by various business groups within the company and we centrally manage key crossbusiness group product initiatives to align and prioritize our rd activities across these groups in addition we may augment our rd initiatives by investing in companies or entering into agreements with companies that have similar rd focus areas for example we have an agreement with micron for joint development of nand flash memory technologies 

 

we also work with a worldwide network of academic government and industry researchers scientists and engineers in the computing and communications fields our network of technology professionals allows us as well as others in our industry to benefit from development initiatives in a variety of areas eventually leading to innovative technologies for users we believe that we are well positioned in the technology industry to help drive innovation foster collaboration and promote industry standards that will yield innovative and improved technologies for users 

 

employees 

 

in september 2006 we announced a restructuring plan that has resulted in headcount reductions primarily through workforce reductions attrition and targeted business divestitures see “results of operations” within “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation” in part ii item 7 of this form 10k for further details regarding our restructuring actions as of december 29 2007 we had approximately 86300 employees worldwide with more than 50 of these employees located in the us worldwide we had approximately 94100 employees as of december 30 2006 and 99900 as of december 31 2005 

sales and marketing 

 

customers 

 

we sell our products primarily to original equipment manufacturers oems and original design manufacturers odms odms provide design andor manufacturing services to branded and unbranded privatelabel resellers in addition we sell our products to other manufacturers including makers of a wide range of industrial and communications equipment our customers also include pc and network communications products users who buy pc components and our other products through distributor reseller retail and oem channels throughout the world in certain instances we have entered into supply agreements to continue to manufacture and sell products of divested business lines to acquiring companies during certain transition periods 

 

our worldwide reseller sales channel consists of thousands of indirect customers who are systems builders that purchase intel microprocessors and other products from our distributors we have a “boxed processor program” that allows distributors to sell intel microprocessors in small quantities to these systemsbuilder customers boxed processors are also available in direct retail outlets 

 

in 2007 dell inc accounted for 18 of our net revenue 19 in 2006 and hewlettpackard company accounted for 17 of our net revenue 16 in 2006 no other customer accounted for more than 10 of our net revenue for information about revenue and operating profit by operating segment and revenue from unaffiliated customers by geographic regioncountry see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation” in part ii item 7 and “note 22 operating segment and geographic information” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

 

sales arrangements 

 

our products are sold or licensed through sales offices throughout the world sales of our products are typically made via purchase orders that contain standard terms and conditions covering matters such as pricing payment terms and warranties as well as indemnities for issues specific to our products such as patent and copyright indemnities from time to time we may enter into additional agreements with customers covering for example changes from our standard terms and conditions new product development and marketing privatelabel branding and other matters most of our sales are made using electronic and webbased processes that allow the customer to review inventory availability and track the progress of specific goods ordered pricing on particular products may vary based on volumes ordered and other factors we also offer discounts rebates and other incentives to customers to increase acceptance of our products and technology 

 

our products are typically shipped under terms that transfer title to the customer even in arrangements for which the recognition of revenue on the sale is deferred our standard terms and conditions of sale typically provide that payment is due at a later date generally 30 days after shipment delivery or the customer’s use of the product our credit department sets accounts receivable and shipping limits for individual customers to control credit risk to intel arising from outstanding account balances we assess credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis and from this analysis we establish credit limits and determine whether we will seek to use one or more credit support devices such as obtaining some form of thirdparty guaranty or standby letter of credit or obtaining credit insurance for all or a portion of the account balance if necessary credit losses may still be incurred due to bankruptcy fraud or other failure of the customer to pay see “schedule ii—valuation and qualifying accounts” in part iv of this form 10k for information about our allowance for doubtful receivables 

 

distribution 

 

typically distributors handle a wide variety of products including those that compete with our products and fill orders for many customers most of our sales to distributors are made under agreements allowing for price protection on unsold merchandise and a right of return on stipulated quantities of unsold merchandise we also utilize thirdparty sales representatives who generally do not offer directly competitive products but may carry complementary items manufactured by others sales representatives do not maintain a product inventory instead their customers place orders directly with us or through distributors 

 

backlog 

 

we do not believe that backlog as of any particular date is meaningful as our sales are made primarily pursuant to standard purchase orders for delivery of products only a small portion of our orders is noncancelable and the dollar amount associated with the noncancelable portion is not significant 

seasonal trends 

 

our microprocessor sales generally have followed a seasonal trend however there can be no assurance that this trend will continue historically our sales of microprocessors have been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year consumer purchases of pcs have been higher in the second half of the year primarily due to backtoschool and holiday demand in addition purchases from businesses have tended to be higher in the second half of the year 

 

marketing 

 

our corporate marketing focus is on advanced multicore microprocessors multicore microprocessors are at the center of our most advanced processor technologies which include intel centrino processor technologies intel core 2 processors with vpro technology and intel core 2 processors with viiv technology the intel core 2 quad intel core 2 extreme intel core 2 duo itanium intel xeon pentium and celeron trademarks make up our processor brands we promote brand awareness and generate demand through our own direct marketing as well as comarketing programs our direct marketing activities include television print and webbased advertising as well as press relations consumer and trade events and industry and consumer communications we market to consumer and business audiences and focus on building awareness and generating demand for increased performance power efficiency and new capabilities 

 

purchases by customers often allow them to participate in cooperative advertising and marketing programs such as the intel inside ® program this program broadens the reach of our brands beyond the scope of our own direct advertising through the intel inside program certain customers are licensed to place intel logos on computers containing our microprocessors and processor technologies and to use our brands in marketing activities the program includes a market development component that accrues funds based on purchases and partially reimburses the oems for marketing activities for products featuring intel brands subject to the oems meeting defined criteria these marketing activities primarily include television webbased marketing and print and in the beginning of 2008 we increased our focus on webbased marketing we have also entered into joint marketing arrangements with certain customers 

 

competition 

 

our products compete primarily based on performance features price quality brand recognition and availability our ability to compete depends on our ability to provide innovative products and worldwide support for our customers at competitive prices including providing improved energyefficient performance enhanced security manageability and integrated solutions in addition to our various computing networking and communications products we offer platforms that incorporate various components designed and configured to work together to provide an optimized user computing solution compared to ingredients that are used separately 

 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid advances in technology and new product introductions as unit volumes of a particular product grow production experience is accumulated and costs typically decrease further competition develops and as a result prices decline the life cycle of our products is very short sometimes less than a year our ability to compete depends on our ability to improve our products and processes faster than our competitors anticipate changing customer requirements and develop and launch new products and platforms while reducing our average perunit costs see “risk factors” in part i item 1a of this form 10k 

 

many companies compete with us in the various computing networking and communications market segments and are engaged in the same basic business activities including rd worldwide these competitors range in size from large established multinational companies with multiple product lines to smaller companies and new entrants to the marketplace that compete in specialized market segments some of our competitors may have development agreements with other companies and in some cases our competitors may also be our customers andor suppliers product offerings may cross over into multiple product categories offering us new opportunities but also resulting in more competition it may be difficult for us to compete in market segments where our competitors have established products and brand recognition 

we believe that our network of manufacturing facilities and assembly and test facilities gives us a competitive advantage this network enables us to have more direct control over our processes quality control product cost volume timing of production and other factors these facilities require significant upfront capital spending and many of our competitors do not own such facilities because they may not be able to afford to do so or because their business models involve the use of thirdparty facilities for manufacturing and assembly and test these “fabless semiconductor companies” include broadcom corporation nvidia corporation qualcomm incorporated and via technologies inc via some of our competitors own portions of such facilities through investment or jointventure arrangements with other companies a group of foundries and assembly and test subcontractors offer their services to companies that do not own facilities or to companies needing additional capacity these foundries and subcontractors may also offer intellectual property design services and other goods and services to our competitors competitors who outsource their manufacturing and assembly and test operations can significantly reduce their capital expenditures 

 

we plan to continue to cultivate new businesses and work with the computing and communications industries through standards bodies trade associations oems odms and independent software and operating system vendors to help align the industry to offer products that take advantage of the latest market trends and usage models we frequently participate in industry initiatives designed to discuss and agree upon technical specifications and other aspects of technologies that could be adopted as standards by standardssetting organizations our competitors may also participate in the same initiatives and specification development our participation does not ensure that any standards or specifications adopted by these organizations will be consistent with our product planning 

 

microprocessors 

 

we continue to be largely dependent on the success of our microprocessor business our ability to compete depends on our ability to deliver new microprocessor products with improved overall performance andor improved energyefficient performance at competitive prices some of our microprocessor competitors such as advanced micro devices inc amd market softwarecompatible products that compete with our processors we also face competition from companies offering rival architecture designs such as cell broadband engine architecture developed jointly by international business machines corporation ibm sony corporation and toshiba corporation power architecture offered by ibm arm architecture advanced risc machine developed by arm limited and scalable processor architecture sparc offered by sun microsystems inc 

 

the following is a list of our main microprocessor competitors by market segment 

  

chipsets 

 

our chipsets compete in the various market segments against different types of chipsets that support either our microprocessor products or rival microprocessor products competing chipsets are produced by companies such as amd including chipsets marketed under the ati technologies inc brand nvidia silicon integrated systems corporation sis and via 

 

we also compete with companies offering graphics components and other specialpurpose products used in the desktop mobile and enterprise market segments one aspect of our business model is to incorporate improved performance and advanced properties into our microprocessors and chipsets the demand for which may increasingly be affected by competition from companies such as nvidia whose business models are based on incorporating improved performance into dedicated chipsets and other components such as graphics controllers 

 

flash memory 

 

our nand flash memory products currently compete with nor and nand products primarily manufactured by hynix semiconductor inc samsung electronics co ltd sandisk corporation spansion inc stmicroelectronics and toshiba 

 

connectivity 

 

we offer products designed for wired and wireless connectivity for the communications infrastructure including network processors and for networked storage our wifi and wimax products currently compete with wifi products manufactured by atheros communications inc and broadcom and products manufactured by qualcomm 

acquisitions and strategic investments 

 

during 2007 we completed one acquisition qualifying as a business combination see “note 12 acquisitions” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k also we made two significant strategic investments that we discuss in part ii item 8 of this form 10k see “note 19 ventures” for information on our investment in im flash singapore llp imfs a venture formed with micron to manufacture nand flash memory products and “note 7 investments” for information on our investment in vmware inc 

 

during the first quarter of 2008 we expect to complete the divestiture of our nor flash memory assets to numonyx and we expect to receive an ownership interest in the new company see “note 13 divestitures” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

 

intellectual property and licensing 

 

intellectual property rights that apply to our various products and services include patents copyrights trade secrets trademarks and maskwork rights we maintain a program to protect our investment in technology by attempting to ensure respect for our intellectual property rights the extent of the legal protection given to different types of intellectual property rights varies under different countries’ legal systems we intend to license our intellectual property rights where we can obtain adequate consideration see “competition” in part i item 1 of this form 10k “legal proceedings” in part i item 3 of this form 10k and “risk factors” in part i item 1a of this form 10k 

 

we have filed and obtained a number of patents in the us and other countries while our patents are an important element of our success our business as a whole is not significantly dependent on any one patent we and other companies in the computing telecommunications and related hightechnology fields typically apply for and receive in the aggregate tens of thousands of overlapping patents annually in the us and other countries 

 

we believe that the duration of the applicable patents that we are granted is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products because of the fast pace of innovation and product development our products are often obsolete before the patents related to them expire and sometimes are obsolete before the patents related to them are even granted as we expand our product offerings into new industries we also seek to extend our patent development efforts to patent such product offerings established competitors in existing and new industries as well as companies that purchase and enforce patents and other intellectual property may already have patents covering similar products there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain patents covering our own products or that we will be able to obtain licenses from such companies on favorable terms or at all 

 

the majority of the software that we distribute including software embedded in our component and systemlevel products is entitled to copyright protection 

 

to distinguish intel products from our competitors’ products we have obtained certain trademarks and trade names for our products and we maintain cooperative advertising programs with certain customers to promote our brands and to identify products containing genuine intel components 

 

we also protect certain details about our processes products and strategies as trade secrets keeping confidential the information that we believe provides us with a competitive advantage we have ongoing programs designed to maintain the confidentiality of such information 

compliance with environmental health and safety regulations 

 

we are committed to achieving high standards of environmental quality and product safety and we strive to provide a safe and healthy workplace for our employees contractors and the communities in which we do business we have environmental health and safety ehs policies and expectations that apply to our global operations each of our worldwide production facilities is in compliance with the international organization for standardization iso 14001 environmental management system standard our internal ehs auditing program addresses not only compliance but also business risk and management systems we focus on minimizing and properly managing the hazardous materials used in our facilities and products we monitor regulatory and resource trends and set companywide short and longterm performance targets for key resources and emissions these targets address several parameters including energy and water use climate change waste recycling and emissions for example we continue to take action to achieve our global greenhouse gas reduction goal by investing in energy conservation projects in our factories and working with suppliers of manufacturing tools to improve energy efficiency we also focus on developing innovative solutions to improve the energy efficiency of our products and those of our customers we take a holistic approach to power management addressing the challenge at all levels including the silicon package circuit micromacro architecture platform and software levels 

 

the production of our products requires the use of hazardous materials that are subject to a broad array of ehs laws and regulations we actively monitor the materials used in the production of our products we have specific restrictions on the content of certain hazardous materials in our products as well as those of our suppliers and outsourced manufacturers and subcontractors we continue to make efforts to reduce hazardous materials in our products to position us to meet various environmental restrictions on product content throughout the world for example processors manufactured using our new 45nm hik metal gate silicon technology are manufactured using a leadfree process as we continue to advance process technology the materials technologies and products themselves become increasingly complex our evaluations of materials for use in rd and production take into account ehs considerations compliance with these complex laws and regulations as well as internal voluntary programs is integrated into our “design for ehs” programs 

 

we are committed to protecting the environment and human rights throughout our supply chain we expect suppliers and subcontractors to understand and fully comply with all ehs and related laws and regulations and labor laws including at a minimum those covering nondiscrimination in the terms and conditions of employment child labor minimum wages employee benefits and work hours in addition we expect suppliers to abide by our policies such as our code of conduct and the electronic industry code of conduct 

executive officers of the registrant 

 

the following sets forth certain information with regard to our executive officers as of february 19 2008 ages are as of december 29 2007 

 

 

 




 item 1a risk factors 

 

fluctuations in demand for our products may harm our financial results and are difficult to forecast 

if demand for our products fluctuates our revenue and gross margin could be harmed important factors that could cause demand for our products to fluctuate include 

  

if product demand decreases our manufacturing or assembly and test capacity could be underutilized and we may be required to record an impairment on our longlived assets including facilities and equipment as well as intangible assets which would increase our expenses in addition factoryplanning decisions may shorten the useful lives of longlived assets including facilities and equipment and cause us to accelerate depreciation in the long term if product demand increases we may not be able to add manufacturing or assembly and test capacity fast enough to meet market demand these changes in demand for our products and changes in our customers’ product needs could have a variety of negative effects on our competitive position and our financial results and in certain cases may reduce our revenue increase our costs lower our gross margin percentage or require us to recognize impairments of our assets in addition if product demand decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately we could be required to write off inventory or record underutilization charges which would have a negative impact on our gross margin 

 

the semiconductor industry and our operations are characterized by a high percentage of costs that are fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term and by product demand that is highly variable and subject to significant downturns that may harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

the semiconductor industry and our operations are characterized by high costs such as those related to facility construction and equipment rd and employment and training of a highly skilled workforce that are either fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term at the same time demand for our products is highly variable and there have been downturns often in connection with maturing product cycles as well as downturns in general economic market conditions these downturns have been characterized by reduced product demand manufacturing overcapacity high inventory levels and lower average selling prices the combination of these factors may cause our revenue gross margin cash flow and profitability to vary significantly in both the short and long term 

 

we operate in intensely competitive industries and our failure to respond quickly to technological developments and incorporate new features into our products could harm our ability to compete 

we operate in intensely competitive industries that experience rapid technological developments changes in industry standards changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and improvements if we are unable to respond quickly and successfully to these developments we may lose our competitive position and our products or technologies may become uncompetitive or obsolete to compete successfully we must maintain a successful rd effort develop new products and production processes and improve our existing products and processes at the same pace or ahead of our competitors we may not be able to develop and market these new products successfully the products we invest in and develop may not be well received by customers and products developed and new technologies offered by others may affect demand for our products these types of events could have a variety of negative effects on our competitive position and our financial results such as reducing our revenue increasing our costs lowering our gross margin percentage and requiring us to recognize impairments of our assets 

 

fluctuations in the mix of products sold may harm our financial results 

because of the wide price differences among mobile desktop and server microprocessors the mix and types of performance capabilities of microprocessors sold affect the average selling price of our products and have a substantial impact on our revenue and gross margin our financial results also depend in part on the mix of other products that we sell such as chipsets flash memory and other semiconductor products in addition more recently introduced products tend to have higher associated costs because of initial overall development and production ramp fluctuations in the mix and types of our products may also affect the extent to which we are able to recover the fixed costs and investments associated with a particular product and as a result can harm our financial results 

our global operations subject us to risks that may harm our results of operations and financial condition 

we have sales offices rd manufacturing and assembly and test facilities in many countries and as a result we are subject to risks associated with doing business globally our global operations may be subject to risks that may limit our ability to manufacture assemble and test design develop or sell products in particular countries which could in turn harm our results of operations and financial condition including 

  

in addition although most of our products are priced and paid for in us dollars a significant amount of certain types of expenses such as payroll utilities tax and marketing expenses are paid in local currencies our hedging programs reduce but do not entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements and therefore fluctuations in exchange rates could harm our business operating results and financial condition in addition changes in tariff and import regulations and to us and nonus monetary policies may harm our operating results and financial condition by increasing our expenses and reducing our revenue varying tax rates in different jurisdictions could harm our operating results and financial condition by increasing our overall tax rate 

 

we also maintain a program of insurance coverage for various types of property casualty and other risks we place our insurance coverage with various carriers in numerous jurisdictions the types and amounts of insurance that we obtain vary from time to time and from location to location depending on availability cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention the policies are subject to deductibles and exclusions that result in our retention of a level of risk on a selfinsurance basis losses not covered by insurance may be substantial and may increase our expenses which could harm our results of operations 

 

failure to meet our production targets resulting in undersupply or oversupply of products may harm our business and results of operations 

production of integrated circuits is a complex process disruptions in this process can result from interruptions in our processes errors and difficulties in our development and implementation of new processes defects in materials disruptions in our supply of materials or resources and disruptions at our fabrication and assembly and test facilities due to for example accidents maintenance issues or unsafe working conditions—all of which could affect the timing of production ramps and yields we may not be successful or efficient in developing or implementing new production processes the occurrence of any of the foregoing may result in our failure to meet or increase production as desired resulting in higher costs or substantial decreases in yields which could affect our ability to produce sufficient volume to meet specific product demand the unavailability or reduced availability of certain products could make it more difficult to implement our platform strategy we may also experience increases in yields a substantial increase in yields could result in higher inventory levels and the possibility of resulting excess capacity charges as we slow production to reduce inventory levels the occurrence of any of these events could harm our business and results of operations 

 

we may have difficulties obtaining the resources or products we need for manufacturing assembling and testing our products or operating other aspects of our business which could harm our ability to meet demand for our products and may increase our costs 

we have thousands of suppliers providing various materials that we use in the production of our products and other aspects of our business and we seek where possible to have several sources of supply for all of those materials however we may rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers or upon suppliers in a single country for these materials the inability of such suppliers to deliver adequate supplies of production materials or other supplies could disrupt our production processes or could make it more difficult for us to implement our business strategy in addition production could be disrupted by the unavailability of the resources used in production such as water silicon electricity and gases the unavailability or reduced availability of the materials or resources that we use in our business may require us to reduce production of products or may require us to incur additional costs in order to obtain an adequate supply of those materials or resources the occurrence of any of these events could harm our business and results of operations 

costs related to product defects and errata may harm our results of operations and business 

costs associated with unexpected product defects and errata deviations from published specifications due to for example unanticipated problems in our manufacturing processes include the costs of 

  

these costs could be substantial and may therefore increase our expenses and lower our gross margin in addition our reputation with our customers or users of our products could be damaged as a result of such product defects and errata and the demand for our products could be reduced these factors could harm our financial results and the prospects for our business 

 

we may be subject to claims of infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights which could harm our business 

from time to time third parties may assert against us or our customers alleged patent copyright trademark or other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our business we may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims from certain individuals and companies who have acquired patent portfolios for the sole purpose of asserting such claims against other companies any claims that our products or processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others regardless of the merit or resolution of such claims could cause us to incur significant costs in responding to defending and resolving such claims and may divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel away from our business as a result of such intellectual property infringement claims we could be required or otherwise decide it is appropriate to 

  

the occurrence of any of the foregoing could result in unexpected expenses or require us to recognize an impairment of our assets which would reduce the value of our assets and increase expenses in addition if we alter or discontinue our production of affected items our revenue could be negatively impacted 

 

we may be subject to litigation proceedings that could harm our business 

in addition to the litigation risks mentioned above we may be subject to legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder consumer antitrust and other issues as described in “note 21 contingencies” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k we are currently engaged in a number of litigation matters litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur an unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or in cases for which injunctive relief is sought an injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing or selling one or more products were an unfavorable ruling to occur our business and results of operations could be materially harmed 

 

we may not be able to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights which may harm our ability to compete and harm our business 

our ability to enforce our patents copyrights software licenses and other intellectual property rights is subject to general litigation risks as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our intellectual property rights in various countries when we seek to enforce our rights we are often subject to claims that the intellectual property right is invalid is otherwise not enforceable or is licensed to the party against whom we are asserting a claim in addition our assertion of intellectual property rights often results in the other party seeking to assert alleged intellectual property rights of its own against us which may harm our business if we are not ultimately successful in defending ourselves against these claims in litigation we may not be able to sell a particular product or family of products due to an injunction or we may have to pay damages that could in turn harm our results of operations in addition governments may adopt regulations or courts may render decisions requiring compulsory licensing of intellectual property to others or governments may require that products meet specified standards that serve to favor local companies our inability to enforce our intellectual property rights under these circumstances may harm our competitive position and our business 

our licenses with other companies and our participation in industry initiatives may allow other companies including our competitors to use our patent rights 

companies in the semiconductor industry often rely on the ability to license patents from each other in order to compete many of our competitors have broad licenses or crosslicenses with us and under current case law some of these licenses may permit these competitors to pass our patent rights on to others if one of these licensees becomes a foundry our competitors might be able to avoid our patent rights in manufacturing competing products in addition our participation in industry initiatives may require us to license our patents to other companies that adopt certain industry standards or specifications even when such organizations do not adopt standards or specifications proposed by us as a result our patents implicated by our participation in industry initiatives might not be available for us to enforce against others who might otherwise be deemed to be infringing those patents our costs of enforcing our licenses or protecting our patents may increase and the value of our intellectual property may be impaired 

 

changes in our decisions with regard to our announced restructuring and efficiency efforts and other factors could affect our results of operations and financial condition 

factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations with regard to our announced restructuring include 

  

in order to compete we must attract retain and motivate key employees and our failure to do so could harm our results of operations 

in order to compete we must attract retain and motivate executives and other key employees including those in managerial technical sales marketing and support positions hiring and retaining qualified executives scientists engineers technical staff and sales representatives are critical to our business and competition for experienced employees in the semiconductor industry can be intense to help attract retain and motivate qualified employees we use sharebased incentive awards such as employee stock options and nonvested share units restricted stock units if the value of such stock awards does not appreciate as measured by the performance of the price of our common stock or if our sharebased compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit our ability to attract retain and motivate employees could be weakened which could harm our results of operations 

 

our results of operations could vary as a result of the methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies 

the methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations see “critical accounting estimates” in part ii item 7 of this form 10k such methods estimates and judgments are by their nature subject to substantial risks uncertainties and assumptions and factors may arise over time that lead us to change our methods estimates and judgments changes in those methods estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations 

 

our failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations worldwide could harm our business and results of operations 

the manufacturing and assembling and testing of our products require the use of hazardous materials that are subject to a broad array of environmental health and safety laws and regulations our failure to comply with any of these applicable laws or regulations could result in 

  

in addition our failure to manage the use transportation emission discharge storage recycling or disposal of hazardous materials could subject us to increased costs or future liabilities existing and future environmental laws and regulations could also require us to acquire pollution abatement or remediation equipment modify our product designs or incur other expenses associated with such laws and regulations many new materials that we are evaluating for use in our operations may be subject to regulation under existing or future environmental laws and regulations that may restrict our use of one or more of such materials in our manufacturing assembly and test processes or products any of these restrictions could harm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter our manufacturing and assembly and test processes 

changes in our effective tax rate may harm our results of operations 

a number of factors may increase our future effective tax rates including 

  

any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could reduce net income for future periods 

 

we invest in companies for strategic reasons and may not realize a return on our investments 

we make investments in companies around the world to further our strategic objectives and support our key business initiatives such investments include investments in equity securities of public companies and nonmarketable equity investments in private companies which range from earlystage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models the success of these companies is dependent on product development market acceptance operational efficiency and other key business factors the private companies in which we invest may fail because they may not be able to secure additional funding obtain favorable investment terms for future financings or take advantage of liquidity events such as initial public offerings mergers and private sales if any of these private companies fail we could lose all or part of our investment in that company if we determine that an otherthantemporary decline in the fair value exists for an equity investment in a public or private company in which we have invested we write down the investment to its fair value and recognize the related writedown as an investment loss furthermore when the strategic objectives of an investment have been achieved or if the investment or business diverges from our strategic objectives we may decide to dispose of the investment our nonmarketable equity investments in private companies are not liquid and we may not be able to dispose of these investments on favorable terms or at all the occurrence of any of these events could harm our results of operations additionally for cases in which we are required under equity method accounting to recognize a proportionate share of another company’s income or loss such income and loss may impact our earnings 

 

interest and other net could vary from expectations which could harm our results of operations 

factors that could cause interest and other net in our consolidated statements of income to fluctuate include 

  

our acquisitions divestitures and other transactions could disrupt our ongoing business and harm our results of operations 

in pursuing our business strategy we routinely conduct discussions evaluate opportunities and enter into agreements regarding possible investments acquisitions divestitures and other transactions such as joint ventures acquisitions and other transactions involve significant challenges and risks including risks that 

  

when we decide to sell assets or a business we may encounter difficulty in finding or completing divestiture opportunities or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner and the agreed terms and financing arrangements could be renegotiated due to changes in business or market conditions these circumstances could delay the accomplishment of our strategic objectives or cause us to incur additional expenses with respect to businesses that we want to dispose of or we may dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are less than we had anticipated resulting in a loss on the transaction 

if we do enter into agreements with respect to acquisitions divestitures or other transactions we may fail to complete them due to 

  

further acquisition divestiture and other transactions require substantial management resources and have the potential to divert our attention from our existing business these factors could harm our business and results of operations 

 

the proposed numonyx transaction may be delayed or not consummated 

in may 2007 we announced that we entered into an agreement to form a private independent semiconductor company with stmicroelectronics nv and francisco partners lp later named numonyx see “note 13 divestitures” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k if the transaction is delayed or not consummated we may record additional charges

overview 

 

we make market and sell advanced integrated digital technology products primarily integrated circuits for industries such as computing and communications integrated circuits are semiconductor chips etched with interconnected electronic switches our goal is to be the preeminent provider of semiconductor chips and platforms for the worldwide digital economy our products include chips boards and other semiconductor products that are the building blocks integral to computers servers consumer electronics and handheld devices and networking and communications products our primary componentlevel products include microprocessors chipsets and flash memory we offer products at various levels of integration allowing our customers the flexibility to create advanced computing and communications systems and products 

 

the life cycle of our products is very short sometimes less than a year our ability to compete depends on our ability to improve our products and processes faster than our competitors anticipate changing customer requirements and develop and launch new products and platforms our failure to respond quickly to technological developments and incorporate new features into our products could harm our ability to compete maintaining scale is key to our strategy of ramping new manufacturing technologies and platforms quickly delivering highperformance products and lowering unit costs 

 

as of december 29 2007 our operating segments included the digital enterprise group mobility group nand products group flash memory group digital home group digital health group and software solutions group 

 

net revenue gross margin and operating income for 2007 and 2006 were as follows 

 

 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation continued 

 

overall microprocessor revenue continues to grow and we continue to see a shift in our sales mix from desktop microprocessors to mobile microprocessors microprocessor revenue within the mobility group operating segment increased by 16 in 2007 compared to 2006 the growth in mobile microprocessors has outpaced the growth in desktop microprocessors and we believe this trend will continue with a crossover occurring as early as 2009 as demand for mobile microprocessors continues to grow in the pc market segment system price points have expanded to include new lower prices we expect continuing erosion in average selling prices for mobile microprocessors due to this expansion in lower price points and a continued competitive market segment however mobile microprocessor average selling prices remain higher than desktop microprocessor average selling prices and therefore the shift in our mix to mobile microprocessors has a positive effect on our results due to the price differences among mobile desktop and server microprocessors the mix and types of performance capabilities of microprocessors sold affect the average selling price of our products and have a substantial impact on our revenue 

 

the gross margin percentage was relatively flat in 2007 compared to 2006 during 2007 gross margin benefited from lower microprocessor unit costs as well as a mix shift toward higher margin businesses the decline in unit costs has been possible as we continued to gain production experience on our 65nm process technology in addition we are running our factories at high volumes however during 2007 our gross margin was negatively impacted by declining average selling prices as well as higher startup costs related to our 45nm process technology 

 

our operating income grew faster than revenue during 2007 as we continued to implement our restructuring program and focused on our commitment to efficiency and on spending controls as a result rd and marketing general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 34 in 2006 to 29 in 2007 and the number of employees decreased by 8 compared to the end of 2006 results for 2007 included restructuring and asset impairment charges of 516 million and to date we have incurred 11 billion in charges related to the program which began in the third quarter of 2006 we expect to continue the program in 2008 and expect charges to decline in the second half of the year as part of the restructuring program we divested some of our lower margin businesses and we expect to divest our nor flash memory assets in the first quarter of 2008 as a result of these divestitures we expect a negative impact on revenue and a benefit to our gross margin percentage in 2008 our efficiency efforts have also contributed to faster factory throughput higher yields and improved equipment utilization improvements in our equipment utilization helped enable us to reduce our capital spending from 59 billion in 2006 to 50 billion in 2007 

 

the combination of our technological innovation and our renewed commitment to customer orientation has differentiated our products and technology from our competition and has contributed to our revenue growth which occurred in nearly all product lines and across all geographies we are setting the pace for innovation within the industry by executing on our plan to introduce a new microarchitecture approximately every two years and to ramp the next generation of silicon process technology in the intervening years in 2007 we completed our transition to the intel core microarchitecture initially launched in 2006 in all market segments we also started manufacturing microprocessors using our industryleading 45nm hik metal gate silicon technology which enables higher and more energyefficient processor performance our nextgeneration microarchitecture is scheduled for production in the second half of 2008 and we are also developing our nextgeneration 32nm process technology and expect to begin manufacturing products using that technology in 2009 

 

from a financial condition perspective we ended 2007 with an investment portfolio valued at 193 billion consisting of cash and cash equivalents fixedincome debt instruments included in trading assets and short and longterm investments during 2007 we repurchased 275 billion of stock through our stock repurchase program and paid 26 billion to stockholders as dividends 

 

we exited 2007 with what we believe is the strongest combination of products manufacturing and silicon technology leadership in our history as we continue to ramp our 45nm process technology and plan to introduce our nextgeneration microarchitecture in 2008 also in 2008 we plan to introduce products geared to future growth markets specifically we plan to introduce new microprocessors codenamed “silverthorne” that are designed for notebooks lowpower and lowcost products mids and consumer electronics devices in addition to our microprocessor and chipset development we expect to make significant investments in rd in 2008 in growth areas such as systemonachip mids embedded applications consumer electronics and graphics although there is uncertainty in the global economy we are planning for another year of growth in which profits grow faster than revenue and our investments in products manufacturing and silicon technology continue to generate competitive advantages 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation continued 

 

strategy 

 

our goal is to be the preeminent provider of semiconductor chips and platforms for the worldwide digital economy as part of our overall strategy to compete in each relevant market segment we use our core competencies in the design and manufacture of integrated circuits as well as our financial resources global presence and brand recognition we believe that we have the scale capacity and global reach to establish new technologies and respond to customers’ needs quickly 

 

some of our key focus areas are listed below 

  

we believe that the proliferation of the internet including user demand for premium content and rich media is the primary driver of the need for greater performance in pcs and servers a growing number of older pcs are increasingly incapable of handling the tasks that users are demanding such as streaming video uploading photos and online gaming as these tasks become even more demanding and require more computing power we believe that users will need and want to buy new pcs to perform everyday tasks on the internet we also believe that increased internet traffic is creating a need for greater server infrastructure including server products optimized for energyefficient performance 

 

we have experienced an overall shift in sales mix from desktop microprocessors to mobile microprocessors we believe that based on customer demand and market trends mobile microprocessor shipments will exceed desktop microprocessor shipments as early as 2009 mobile microprocessors generally have higher average selling prices compared to desktop microprocessors so the continued shift in sales mix to mobile microprocessors is expected to positively impact our revenue therefore our strategy focuses on advancing mobile microprocessors to accelerate this shift in sales mix 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation continued 

 

we are investing in areas in which we believe the application of highly integrated intel ® architecture provides growth opportunities such as scalable highperformance visual computing solutions that integrate vivid graphics and supercomputing performance for scientific financial services and other computeintensive applications in addition our design and manufacturing technology leadership including the recent introduction of our new 45nm process technology allows us to develop lowcost lowpower microprocessors for new uses and form factors we believe that these new microprocessors will give us the ability to extend intel architecture and drive growth in new market segments including mids a new category of small mobile consumer devices enabling a pclike internet experience consumer electronics devices which will deliver media and services to settop boxes and tvs over broadband internet connections and ultralowcost pcs designed for emerging markets we believe that the common elements for products in these new market segments are low power low cost and the ability to access the internet

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation continued 

 

critical accounting estimates 

 

the methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our financial statements some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain our most critical accounting estimates include 

  

below we discuss these policies further as well as the estimates and judgments involved we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies such as those for revenue recognition including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors however these policies typically do not require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 

 

nonmarketable equity investments 

 

we regularly invest in nonmarketable equity investments of private companies which range from earlystage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models the carrying value of our nonmarketable equity investment portfolio excluding equity derivatives totaled 34 billion at december 29 2007 28 billion at december 30 2006 and included our investment in imft of 22 billion 13 billion at december 30 2006 our nonmarketable equity investments are classified in other longterm assets on the consolidated balance sheets 

 

nonmarketable equity investments are inherently risky and a number of these companies are likely to fail their success is dependent on product development market acceptance operational efficiency and other factors in addition depending on their future prospects and market conditions they may not be able to raise additional funds when needed or they may receive lower valuations with less favorable investment terms than in previous financings and our investments would likely become impaired 

 

we review our investments quarterly for indicators of impairment however for nonmarketable equity investments the impairment analysis requires significant judgment to identify events or circumstances that would significantly harm the fair value of the investment the indicators that we use to identify those events or circumstances include 

  

investments that we identify as having an indicator of impairment are subject to further analysis to determine if the investment is other than temporarily impaired in which case we write down the investment to its estimated fair value for nonmarketable equity investments that we do not consider viable from a financial or technological point of view we write down the entire investment since we consider the estimated fair value to be nominal over the past 12 quarters including the fourth quarter of 2007 impairments of nonmarketable equity investments have ranged between 10 million and 44 million per quarter 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation continued 

 

longlived assets 

 

we assess the impairment of longlived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant underperformance of a business or product line in relation to expectations significant negative industry or economic trends and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets recoverability of assets that will continue to be used in our operations is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to our estimate of the related total future undiscounted net cash flows if an asset grouping’s carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows the asset grouping is considered to be impaired the impairment is measured by comparing the difference between the asset grouping’s carrying amount and its fair value based on the best information available including market prices or discounted cash flow analysis 

 

impairments of longlived assets are determined for groups of assets related to the lowest level of identifiable independent cash flows due to our asset usage model and the interchangeable nature of our semiconductor manufacturing capacity we must make subjective judgments in determining the independent cash flows that can be related to specific asset groupings in addition as we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions we must make subjective judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets primarily processspecific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements when we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated we accelerate the rate of depreciation over the assets’ new shorter useful lives over the past 12 quarters including the fourth quarter of 2007 impairments and accelerated depreciation of longlived assets have ranged between 1 million and 320 million per quarter this range includes restructuring charges for asset impairments between zero and 317 million per quarter 

 

income taxes 

 

we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes as well as the interest and penalties related to these uncertain tax positions significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 

 

we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets if recovery is not likely we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable we believe that we will ultimately recover a substantial majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets however should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely 

 

the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in the first quarter of 2007 we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes—an interpretation of sfas no 109” fin 48 and related guidance see “note 17 taxes” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k as a result of the implementation of fin 48 we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the twostep process prescribed in the interpretation the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation continued 

 

inventory 

 

the valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality the determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products the demand forecast is included in the development of our shortterm manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuation and build decisions productspecific facts and circumstances reviewed in the inventory valuation process include a review of the customer base the stage of the product life cycle of our products consumer confidence and customer acceptance of our products as well as an assessment of the selling price in relation to the product cost if our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly or if we fail to forecast the demand accurately we could be required to write off inventory which would negatively impact our gross margin 

 

sharebased compensation 

 

effective january 1 2006 we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 123 revised 2004 “sharedbased payment” sfas no 123r sfas no 123r requires employee equity awards to be accounted for under the fair value method total sharebased compensation during 2007 was 952 million 14 billion in 2006 determining the appropriate fairvalue model and calculating the fair value of employee stock options and rights to purchase shares under stock purchase plans at the date of grant require judgment we use the blackscholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of these sharebased awards consistent with the provisions of sfas no 123r option pricing models including the blackscholes model also require the use of input assumptions including expected volatility expected life expected dividend rate and expected riskfree rate of return the assumptions for expected volatility and expected life are the two assumptions that significantly affect the grant date fair value changes in the expected dividend rate and expected riskfree rate of return do not significantly impact the calculation of fair value and determining these inputs is not highly subjective 

 

we use implied volatility based on freely traded options in the open market as we believe implied volatility is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility in determining the appropriateness of implied volatility we considered the following 

  

due to significant differences in the vesting terms and contractual life of current option grants compared to the majority of our historical grants management does not believe that our historical share option exercise data provides us with sufficient evidence to estimate expected term therefore we use the simplified method of calculating expected life described in the sec’s staff accounting bulletin 107 sab 107 in december 2007 the sec issued staff accounting bulletin 110 sab 110 to amend the sec’s views discussed in sab 107 regarding the use of the simplified method in developing an estimate of expected life of share options in accordance with sfas no 123r sab 110 is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008 we will continue to use the simplified method until we have the historical data necessary to provide a reasonable estimate of expected life in accordance with sab 107 as amended by sab 110 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation continued 

 

higher volatility and longer expected lives result in an increase to sharebased compensation determined at the date of grant the effect that changes in the volatility and the expected life would have on the weighted average fair value of option awards and the increase in total fair value during 2007 and 2006 were as follows 

 

 

 

 

  

in addition sfas no 123r requires us to develop an estimate of the number of sharebased awards that will be forfeited due to employee turnover quarterly adjustments in the estimated forfeiture rates can have a significant effect on reported sharebased compensation as we recognize the cumulative effect of the rate adjustments for all expense amortization after january 1 2006 in the period in which the estimated forfeiture rates are adjusted we estimate and adjust forfeiture rates based on a quarterly review of recent forfeiture activity and expected future employee turnover if a revised forfeiture rate is higher than our previously estimated forfeiture rate we make an adjustment that will result in a decrease in the expense recognized in the financial statements if a revised forfeiture rate is lower than the previously estimated forfeiture rate we make an adjustment that will result in an increase in the expense recognized in the financial statements these adjustments affect our gross margin rd expenses and marketing general and administrative expenses the effect of forfeiture adjustments in 2006 and 2007 was insignificant we record cumulative adjustments to the extent that the related expense is recognized in the financial statements beginning with implementation of sfas no 123r in the first quarter of 2006 therefore the potential impact from cumulative forfeiture adjustments will increase in future periods the expense that we recognize in future periods could also differ significantly from the current period and from our forecasts due to adjustments in the assumed forfeiture rates

results of operations 

 

the following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of income data as a percentage of net revenue for the periods indicated 

 

 

 

the following table sets forth revenue information of geographic regions for the periods indicated 

 

 

 

our net revenue was 383 billion in 2007 an increase of 8 compared to 2006 higher microprocessor unit sales were partially offset by lower microprocessor average selling prices higher mobile chipset unit sales also contributed to the increase in net revenue 

 

lower nor flash memory revenue was mostly offset by the ramp of our nand flash memory business the decrease in nor flash memory revenue was due to a significant decline in average selling prices lower royalty revenue was offset by higher unit sales 

 

revenue in the asiapacific region increased 11 and revenue in the europe region increased 10 in 2007 compared to 2006 and revenue in both the americas region and japan increased 3 in 2007 compared to 2006 revenue from both mature and emerging markets increased in 2007 compared to 2006 while the revenue in mature markets increased in all four geographic regions the majority of the growth in revenue occurred in the asiapacific region a substantial majority of the increase in emerging markets also occurred in the asiapacific region 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation continued 

 

our overall gross margin dollars for 2007 were 199 billion an increase of 17 billion or 9 compared to 2006 our overall gross margin percentage was relatively flat at 519 in 2007 compared to 515 in 2006 the gross margin percentage increase in the digital enterprise group operating segment was mostly offset by a decrease in the gross margin percentage in the mobility group operating segment and costs associated with the ramp of our nand flash memory business we derived most of our overall gross margin dollars and operating profit in 2007 and 2006 from the sale of microprocessors in the digital enterprise group and mobility group operating segments see “business outlook” for a discussion of gross margin expectations 

 

our net revenue was 354 billion in 2006 a decrease of 9 compared to 2005 substantially all of the decrease was due to significantly lower average selling prices of microprocessors fiscal year 2006 was a 52week fiscal year in contrast to fiscal year 2005 which was a 53week fiscal year 

 

revenue from sales of nor flash memory products decreased in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to lower average selling prices partially offset by higher royalty revenue in 2006 we began shipping nand flash memory products manufactured by imft 

 

revenue in the asiapacific region decreased 10 and revenue in the europe region decreased 20 in 2006 compared to 2005 these decreases were slightly offset by revenue in japan which increased slightly in 2006 compared to 2005 revenue in the americas region was approximately flat in 2006 compared to 2005 mature and emerging markets both declined in 2006 compared to 2005 the decrease within mature markets occurred in the europe and asiapacific regions and a substantial majority of the decrease within the emerging markets occurred in the europe and asiapacific regions 

 

our overall gross margin dollars for 2006 were 182 billion a decrease of 48 billion or 21 compared to 2005 our overall gross margin percentage decreased to 515 in 2006 from 594 in 2005 the gross margin percentage for the digital enterprise group and the mobility group were both lower in 2006 compared to 2005 a mix shift of our total revenue to the mobility group which has a higher gross margin percentage slightly offset these decreases to the overall gross margin we derived most of our overall gross margin dollars in 2006 and 2005 from the sale of microprocessors in the digital enterprise group and mobility group operating segments the 2006 gross margin included the impact of sharebased compensation which we began recognizing in 2006 the 2005 gross margin was affected by a litigation settlement agreement with microunity inc in which we recorded a 140 million charge to cost of sales of which 110 million was allocated to the digital enterprise group and 30 million was allocated to the mobility group 

 

digital enterprise group 

 

the revenue and operating income for the digital enterprise group deg for the three years ended december 29 2007 were as follows 

 

 

 

net revenue for the deg operating segment increased by 464 million or 2 in 2007 compared to 2006 microprocessors within deg include microprocessors designed for the desktop and enterprise computing market segments as well as embedded microprocessors the increase in microprocessor revenue was due to higher microprocessor unit sales and higher enterprise average selling prices these increases were partially offset by lower desktop average selling prices in a competitive pricing environment the decrease in chipset motherboard and other revenue was due to lower motherboard unit sales as well as a decrease in communications infrastructure revenue which is primarily due to divestitures of certain communications infrastructure businesses that were completed in 2006 and 2007 partially offsetting these decreases was higher chipset revenue 

 

operating income increased by 17 billion or 47 in 2007 compared to 2006 the increase in operating income was primarily due to lower desktop microprocessor unit costs and lower operating expenses and to a lesser extent sales of desktop microprocessor inventory that had been previously written off partially offsetting these increases were higher chipset unit costs and approximately 425 million of higher startup costs primarily related to our 45nm process technology in 2007 we began including sharedbased compensation in the computation of operating income loss for each operating segment and adjusted the 2006 operating segment results to reflect this change 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation continued 

 

for 2006 net revenue for the deg operating segment decreased by 53 billion or 21 compared to 2005 the decline in net revenue was mostly due to a significant decline in microprocessor revenue and to a lesser extent a decline in chipset motherboard and other revenue the decline in microprocessor revenue was due to lower average selling prices and unit sales of desktop microprocessors enterprise microprocessor revenue increased in 2006 the decline in chipset motherboard and other revenue was due equally to lower chipset revenue and motherboard revenue 

 

operating income decreased by 55 billion or 61 in 2006 compared to 2005 substantially all of the decrease was due to the revenue decline higher microprocessor unit costs along with 210 million of higher factory underutilization charges were offset by approximately 540 million of lower startup costs unit costs were higher in 2006 compared to 2005 due primarily to a mix shift to dualcore microprocessors results for 2006 included the recognition of sharebased compensation results for 2005 did not include sharebased compensation results for 2005 included a charge related to a settlement agreement with microunity 

 

mobility group 

 

the revenue and operating income for the mobility group mg for the three years ended december 29 2007 were as follows 

 

 

 

net revenue for the mg operating segment increased by 24 billion or 19 in 2007 compared to 2006 microprocessor revenue increased by 14 billion or 16 in 2007 compared to 2006 while chipsets and other revenue increased by 924 million or 30 in 2007 compared to 2006 the increase in microprocessor revenue was due to a significant increase in unit sales partially offset by significantly lower average selling prices the increase in chipset and other revenue was due to higher unit sales of chipsets and to a lesser extent higher revenue from sales of cellular baseband products in the fourth quarter of 2006 we sold certain assets of the business line that included application and cellular baseband processors used in handheld devices however in 2007 we continued to manufacture and sell these products as part of a manufacturing and transition services agreement 

 

operating income increased by 10 billion or 22 in 2007 compared to 2006 the increase in operating income was primarily due to higher revenue lower microprocessor unit costs were more than offset by approximately 330 million of higher startup costs primarily related to our 45nm process technology lower unit costs on wireless connectivity and cellular baseband products were offset by higher chipset unit costs operating expenses were higher in 2007 compared to 2006 however operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased in 2007 compared to 2006 

 

for 2006 net revenue for the mg operating segment increased by 12 billion or 11 compared to 2005 microprocessor revenue increased by 508 million or 6 in 2006 compared to 2005 while chipsets and other revenue increased by 670 million or 28 in 2006 compared to 2005 the increase in microprocessor revenue was due to higher unit sales largely offset by lower average selling prices the majority of the increase in chipset and other revenue was due to higher revenue from sales of chipsets and to a lesser extent higher revenue from sales of wireless connectivity products sales of these products increased primarily due to increased sales of our intel centrino processor technologies 

 

operating income decreased by 740 million or 14 in 2006 compared to 2005 the decline was primarily caused by higher operating expenses due in part to the recognition of sharebased compensation results for 2005 did not include sharebased compensation the effects of higher revenue were offset by higher unit costs for microprocessors startup costs were approximately 170 million lower in 2006 compared to 2005 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation continued 

 

operating expenses 

 

operating expenses for the three years ended december 29 2007 were as follows 

 

 

 

research and development rd spending decreased 118 million or 2 in 2007 compared to 2006 and increased 728 million or 14 in 2006 compared to 2005 the decrease in 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily due to lower process development costs as we transitioned from rd to manufacturing using our 45nm process technology partially offset by higher profitdependent compensation the increase in 2006 compared to 2005 was primarily due to sharebased compensation resulting from the implementation of sfas no 123r in 2006 and to a lesser extent higher development costs driven by our 45nm process technology 

 

marketing general and administrative marketing general and administrative expenses decreased 695 million or 11 in 2007 compared to 2006 and increased 408 million or 7 in 2006 compared to 2005 the decrease in 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily due to lower headcount lower sharebased compensation and lower cooperative advertising expenses partially offset by higher profitdependent compensation the increase in 2006 compared to 2005 was primarily due to sharebased compensation resulting from the implementation of sfas no 123r in 2006 and to a lesser extent higher headcount partially offsetting these increases were lower marketing program spending and lower profitdependent compensation 

 

rd along with marketing general and administrative expenses were 29 of net revenue in 2007 34 of net revenue in 2006 and 28 of net revenue in 2005 fiscal year 2005 included 53 weeks the percentage decline in 2007 compared to 2006 is an indication of our progress toward improving our cost structure and efficiency as we grew revenue at a faster rate than operating expenses 

 

restructuring and asset impairment charges in the third quarter of 2006 management approved several actions that were recommended by our structure and efficiency task force as part of a restructuring plan designed to improve operational efficiency and financial results some of these activities involve cost savings or other actions that do not result in restructuring charges such as better utilization of assets reduced spending and organizational efficiencies the efficiency program includes headcount targets for various groups within the company and these targets are being met through ongoing employee attrition and terminations in addition business divestitures further reduce our headcount 

 

restructuring and asset impairment charges for the three years ended december 29 2007 were as follows 

 

 

 

during 2006 we completed the divestiture of three businesses concurrently with the ongoing execution of our efficiency program see “note 13 divestitures” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion in connection with the divestiture of certain assets of our communications and application processor business we recorded impairment charges of 103 million related to the writedown of manufacturing tools to their fair value less the cost to dispose of the assets we determined the fair value using a marketbased valuation technique in addition as a result of both this divestiture and a subsequent assessment of our worldwide manufacturing capacity operations we placed for sale our fabrication facility in colorado springs colorado this plan resulted in an impairment charge of 214 million to write down to fair value the land building and equipment asset grouping that has been principally used to support our communications and application processor business we determined the fair market value of the asset grouping using an average of the results from using the cost approach and market approach valuation techniques 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation continued 

 

during 2007 we incurred an additional 54 million in asset impairment charges as a result of softer than anticipated market conditions related to the colorado springs facility also we recorded land and building writedowns related to certain facilities in santa clara california in addition during the fourth quarter we incurred 85 million in asset impairment charges related to the anticipated divestiture of our nor flash memory business the impairment charges were determined using the revised fair value less selling costs that we expected to receive upon completion of the divestiture see “note 13 divestitures” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k for further information on this divestiture which is expected to be completed during the first quarter of 2008 

 

the following table summarizes the restructuring and asset impairment activity for 2006 and 2007 

 

 

 

we recorded the additional accruals net of adjustments as restructuring and asset impairment charges on the consolidated statements of income the remaining accrual as of december 29 2007 was related to severance benefits that we recorded as a current liability within accrued compensation and benefits on the consolidated balance sheets 

 

from the third quarter of 2006 through the fourth quarter of 2007 we incurred a total of 11 billion in restructuring and asset impairment charges related to this plan these charges included a total of 527 million related to employee severance and benefit arrangements due to the termination of approximately 9900 employees of which 7700 employees had left the company as of december 29 2007 a substantial majority of these employee terminations affected employees within manufacturing information technology and marketing of the employee severance and benefit charges incurred as of december 29 2007 we had paid 400 million the restructuring and asset impairment charges also included 544 million in asset impairment charges 

 

we estimate that employee severance and benefit charges to date will result in gross annual savings of approximately 10 billion a portion of which we began to realize in the third quarter of 2006 we are realizing these savings within marketing general and administrative expenses cost of sales and rd our outlook for the first quarter of 2008 is for additional restructuring and asset impairment charges of 100 million we may incur additional restructuring charges in the future for employee severance and benefit arrangements as well as facilityrelated or other exit activities 

 

amortization of acquisitionrelated intangibles and costs amortization of acquisitionrelated intangibles and costs was 16 million in 2007 42 million in 2006 and 126 million in 2005 the decreased amortization each year compared to the previous year was primarily due to a portion of the intangibles related to prior acquisitions becoming fully amortized 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation continued 

 

gains losses on equity investments interest and other and provision for taxes 

 

gains losses on equity investments net interest and other net and provision for taxes for the three years ended december 29 2007 were as follows 

 

 

 

net gains on equity investments were 157 million in 2007 compared to 214 million in 2006 during 2007 we recognized higher losses from our equity method investments primarily from our investment in clearwire corporation in addition we recognized higher impairment charges partially offset by higher gains on sales of equity investments and other equity transactions impairment charges were 120 million in 2007 

 

net gains on equity investments were 214 million in 2006 compared to net losses of 45 million in 2005 during 2006 we recognized higher gains on sales of equity investments and lower impairment charges compared to 2005 net gains on equity investments in 2006 included the gain of 103 million on the sale of a portion of our investment in micron which was sold for 275 million impairment charges were 79 million in 2006 compared to 208 million in 2005 during 2005 impairment charges included a 105 million impairment charge on our investment in micron 

 

interest and other net decreased to 793 million in 2007 compared to 12 billion in 2006 primarily due to lower divestiture gains partially offset by higher interest income resulting primarily from higher average investment balances and to a lesser extent higher interest rates interest and other net increased to 12 billion in 2006 compared to 565 million in 2005 reflecting net gains of 612 million for three divestitures see “note 13 divestitures” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k and higher interest income as a result of higher interest rates partially offset by lower average investment balances 

 

our effective income tax rate was 239 in 2007 286 in 2006 and 313 in 2005 the rate decreased in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to the reversal of previously accrued taxes of 481 million including 50 million of accrued interest related to settlements with the us internal revenue service in the first and second quarters of 2007 our effective income tax rate was lower in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to a higher percentage of our profits being derived from lower tax jurisdictions in addition the rate for 2005 included an increase to the tax provision of approximately 265 million as a result of the decision to repatriate nonus earnings under the american jobs creation act of 2004 partially offsetting the decrease in the effective tax rate was the impact of sharebased compensation in 2006 the phasing out of the tax benefit for export sales only slightly increased the effective tax rate compared to 2005 given the decrease in income before taxes 

 

sharebased compensation 

 

sharebased compensation totaled 952 million in 2007 14 billion in 2006 and zero in 2005 sharebased compensation was included in cost of sales and operating expenses we adopted sfas no 123r under the modified prospective transition method effective beginning in 2006 prior to the adoption of sfas no 123r we accounted for our equity incentive plans under the intrinsic value recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board apb opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” and related interpretations accordingly no sharebased compensation was recognized in net income the decrease in sharebased compensation from 2006 to 2007 was a result of fewer equity awards vesting in 2007 compared to 2006 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation continued 

 

as of december 29 2007 unrecognized sharebased compensation costs and the weighted average periods over which the costs are expected to be recognized were as follows 

 

 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

cash shortterm investments fixedincome debt instruments included in trading assets and debt at the end of each period were as follows 

 

 

 

in summary our cash flows were as follows 

 

 

 

operating activities 

 

cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain noncash items and changes in assets and liabilities for 2007 compared to 2006 the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to higher net income changes to working capital in 2007 from 2006 were approximately flat with a decrease in inventory levels in 2007 compared to an increase in 2006 offset by higher purchases of trading assets exceeding maturities lower product costs and the reclassification of nor inventory to held for sale in conjunction with our anticipated divestiture of the nor flash memory business contributed to the lower inventory balance in 2007 in comparison our inventory increased in 2006 as a result of higher product costs in 2007 we began designating floatingrate securitized financial instruments purchased after 2006 as trading assets 

 

for 2007 and 2006 our two largest customers accounted for 35 of our net revenue in 2007 one of these customers accounted for 18 of our net revenue 19 in 2006 and another customer accounted for 17 of our net revenue 16 in 2006 additionally these two largest customers accounted for 35 of our accounts receivable at december 29 2007 and december 30 2006 

 

for 2006 compared to 2005 the largest contributing factors to the decrease in cash provided by operating activities were lower net income lower net maturities of trading assets and changes in the amount of estimated tax payments partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable balances fiscal year 2006 included sharebased compensation charges of 14 billion zero for 2005 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation continued 

 

investing activities 

 

investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures and net investment purchases maturities and disposals for 2007 compared to 2006 the increase in cash used for investing activities was primarily due to higher purchases of availableforsale investments lower capital spending was mostly offset by lower proceeds from divestitures 

 

during 2007 we purchased more availableforsale investments particularly shortterm highly liquid investments as our level of cash available to invest increased we received lower cash from divestitures 32 million for one divestiture in 2007 compared to 752 million for three divestitures in 2006 see “note 13 divestitures” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k our capital expenditures were 50 billion in 2007 and were primarily for the ramping of our new fabrication facilities capital expenditures for fiscal 2008 are currently expected to be approximately 52 billion plus or minus 200 million capital expenditures during fiscal 2008 are expected to be funded by cash flows from operating activities capital expenditures were 59 billion in 2006 and 2005 

 

the decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2006 compared to 2005 was primarily due to higher net maturities and sales of availableforsale investments cash received from divestitures in 2006 and the sale of a portion of our investment in micron for 275 million partially offsetting these impacts in 2006 we paid 600 million in cash for our equity investment in clearwire and 615 million in cash for our equity investment in imft in addition to the 615 million paid in cash our initial investment in imft of 12 billion included the issuance of 581 million in notes reflected as a financing activity and a capital contribution of 128 million 

 

financing activities 

 

financing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases and retirement of common stock payment of dividends to stockholders and proceeds from sales of shares through employee equity incentive plans 

 

for 2007 compared to 2006 the lower cash used in financing activities was primarily due to an increase in proceeds from sales of shares through employee equity incentive plans and a decrease in repurchases and retirement of common stock proceeds from sales of shares through employee equity incentive plans totaled 31 billion in 2007 compared to 10 billion in 2006 due to a higher volume of exercises of stock options because of our stock price trading at higher levels in 2007 compared to 2006 and a higher weighted average exercise price during 2007 we repurchased 111 million shares of common stock as part of our common stock repurchase program at a cost of 275 billion 226 million shares at a cost of 46 billion during 2006 as of december 29 2007 145 billion remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization of 25 billion we base our level of stock repurchases on internal cash management decisions and this level may fluctuate our dividend payments for 2007 were 26 billion on january 17 2008 our board of directors declared a cash dividend of 01275 per common share for the first quarter of 2008 which represents a 13 increase in our quarterly cash dividend amount 

 

the lower cash used in financing activities in 2006 compared to 2005 was primarily due to a decrease in repurchases and retirement of common stock partially offset by additions to longterm debt in 2005 of 17 billion 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation continued 

 

liquidity 

 

cash generated by operations is used as our primary source of liquidity as of december 29 2007 we also had an investment portfolio valued at 193 billion consisting of cash and cash equivalents fixedincome debt instruments included in trading assets and short and longterm investments substantially all of our investments in debt instruments are with aa2 or better rated issuers and the substantial majority of the issuers are rated aaaa2 or better in addition to requiring all investments with original maturities of up to six months to be rated at least a1p1 by standard  poorsmoody’s our investment policy specifies a higher minimum rating for investments with longer maturities for instance investments with maturities beyond three years require a minimum rating of aaaa3 government regulations imposed on investment alternatives of our nonus subsidiaries or the absence of a rated counterparties in certain countries result in some minor exceptions which are reviewed annually by the finance committee of our board of directors as of december 29 2007 95 billion of our portfolio had a remaining maturity of less than three months and a substantial majority of our investments have remaining maturities of two years or less in 2007 we did not recognize any otherthantemporary impairments on our portfolio of availableforsale investments during 2007 24 million of unrealized losses were recognized related to debt instruments classified as trading assets and as of december 29 2007 62 million of losses were unrealized related to debt instruments classified as availableforsale substantially all of our unrealized losses can be attributed to fair value fluctuations in an unstable credit environment as of december 29 2007 only 125 million of our investments did not comply with our credit guidelines due to rating downgrades after the initial investment however these investments continue to be rated as investmentgrade securities 

 

our portfolio includes 18 billion of assetbacked securities collateralized by firstlien mortgages credit card debt student loans and auto loans as of december 29 2007 approximately onethird of our assetbacked securities were collateralized by firstlien mortgages the mortgagebacked securities have an 80 loantovalue ratio on average and they include only firstlien mortgages the average subordination level of the securities that we held as of december 29 2007 was 27 ranging from 18 to 40 implying that the mortgage pool would have to suffer losses beyond those levels before our securities experience realized losses in 2007 our assetbacked securities experienced unrealized fair value declines totaling 42 million of which 19 million was recognized in our income statement for those classified under trading assets as of december 29 2007 all of our investments in assetbacked securities were rated aaaaaa and the weighted average remaining maturity was less than two years 

 

we have the intent and ability to hold our debt investments for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery of the principal amounts invested 

 

we continually monitor the credit risk in our portfolio and mitigate our credit and interest rate exposures in accordance with the policies approved by our board of directors we intend to continue to closely monitor future developments in the credit markets and make appropriate changes to our investment policy as deemed necessary based on our ability to liquidate our investment portfolio and our expected operating cash flows we do not anticipate any liquidity constraints as a result of the current credit environment 

 

another potential source of liquidity is authorized borrowings including commercial paper of up to 30 billion there were no borrowings under our commercial paper program during 2007 we also have an automatic shelf registration on file with the sec pursuant to which we may offer an indeterminate amount of debt equity and other securities 

 

we believe that we have the financial resources needed to meet business requirements for the next 12 months including capital expenditures for the expansion or upgrading of worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test capacity working capital requirements the dividend program potential stock repurchases and potential acquisitions or strategic investments 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation continued 

 

contractual obligations 

 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at december 29 2007 

 

 

 

  

contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services generally include agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on intel and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction the table above also includes agreements to purchase raw materials that have cancellation provisions requiring little or no payment the amounts under such contracts are included in the table above because management believes that cancellation of these contracts is unlikely and expects to make future cash payments according to the contract terms or in similar amounts for similar materials for other obligations with cancellation provisions the amounts included in the table above were limited to the noncancelable portion of the agreement terms andor the minimum cancellation fee 

 

we have entered into certain agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods that specify minimum prices and quantities that are based on a percentage of the total available market or based on a percentage of our future purchasing requirements due to the uncertainty of the future market and our future purchasing requirements obligations under these agreements are not included in the table above we estimate our obligation under these agreements as of december 29 2007 to be approximately as follows less than one year—331 million one to three years—377 million three to five years—2 million more than five years—zero our purchase orders for other products are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons in addition some of our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation continued 

 

contractual obligations that are contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones are not included in the table above these obligations include milestonebased comarketing agreements contingent fundingpayment obligations and milestonebased equity investment funding these arrangements are not considered contractual obligations until the milestone is met by the third party as of december 29 2007 assuming that all future milestones are met additional required payments would be approximately 254 million 

 

for the majority of restricted stock units granted the number of shares issued on the date the restricted stock units vest is net of the statutory withholding requirements that are paid by intel on behalf of our employees the obligation to pay the relative taxing authority is not included in the table above as the amount is contingent upon continued employment in addition the amount of the obligation is unknown as it is based in part on the market price of our common stock when the awards vest 

 

the expected timing of payments of the obligations above are estimates based on current information timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations amounts disclosed as contingent or milestonebased obligations are dependent on the achievement of the milestones or the occurrence of the contingent events and can vary significantly 

 

we have a contractual obligation to purchase the output of imft and imfs in proportion to our investments currently 49 in each of these ventures however imfs is in its construction phase and has had no production to date see “note 19 ventures” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k additionally we have entered into various contractual commitments in relation to our investments in imft and imfs some of these commitments are with micron and some are directly with imft or imfs the following are the significant contractual commitments 

  

offbalancesheet arrangements 

 

as of december 29 2007 we did not have any significant offbalancesheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation continued 

 

business outlook 

 

our future results of operations and the topics of other forwardlooking statements contained in this form 10k including this mda involve a number of risks and uncertainties—in particular our goals and strategies new product introductions plans to cultivate new businesses pending divestitures future economic conditions revenue pricing gross margin and costs capital spending depreciation rd expenses marketing general and administrative expenses potential impairment of investments our effective tax rate pending legal proceedings net gains losses from equity investments and interest and other net our future results of operations may also be affected by the amount type and valuation of sharebased awards granted as well as the amount of awards cancelled due to employee turnover and the timing of award exercises by employees we are focusing on efforts to improve operational efficiency and reduce spending that may result in several actions that could have an impact on expense levels and gross margin in addition to the various important factors discussed above a number of other important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations see the risks described in “risk factors” in part i item 1a of this form 10k 

 

our expectations for 2008 are as follows 

  

status of business outlook 

 

we expect that our corporate representatives will from time to time meet privately with investors investment analysts the media and others and may reiterate the forwardlooking statements contained in the “business outlook” section and elsewhere in this form 10k including any such statements that are incorporated by reference in this form 10k at the same time we will keep this form 10k and our most current business outlook publicly available on our investor relations web site at wwwintccom  the public can continue to rely on the business outlook published on the web site as representing our current expectations on matters covered unless we publish a notice stating otherwise the statements in the “business outlook” and other forwardlooking statements in this form 10k are subject to revision during the course of the year in our quarterly earnings releases and sec filings and at other times 

 

from the close of business on march 7 2008 until our quarterly earnings release is published presently scheduled for april 15 2008 we will observe a “quiet period” during the quiet period the “business outlook” and other forwardlooking statements first published in our form 8k filed on january 15 2008 as reiterated or updated as applicable in this form 10k should be considered historical speaking as of prior to the quiet period only and not subject to update during the quiet period our representatives will not comment on our business outlook or our financial results or expectations the exact timing and duration of the routine quiet period and any others that we utilize from time to time may vary at our discretion 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in currency exchange rates interest rates and equity prices we use derivative financial instruments primarily to mitigate these risks all of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial positions at december 29 2007 and december 30 2006 actual results may differ materially 

 

currency exchange rates 

 

we generally hedge currency risks of nonusdollardenominated investments in debt instruments with offsetting currency borrowings currency forward contracts or currency interest rate swaps gains and losses on these nonuscurrency investments would generally be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments resulting in negligible net exposure 

 

a majority of our revenue expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars however certain operating expenditures and capital purchases are incurred in or exposed to other currencies primarily the euro the israeli shekel and the chinese yuan to protect against reductions in value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates we have established balance sheet and anticipated transaction risk management programs currency forward contracts and currency options are generally utilized in these hedging programs our hedging programs reduce but do not always entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements see “risk factors” in part ii item 1a of this form 10k we considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that a weighted average adverse change of 15 in currency exchange rates could be experienced in the near term such an adverse change after taking into account hedges and offsetting positions would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before taxes of less than 35 million at the end of 2007 and 2006 

 

interest rates 

 

we are exposed to interest rate risk related to our investment portfolio and debt issuances the primary objective of our investments in debt instruments is to preserve principal while maximizing yields to achieve this objective the returns on all of our investments in debt instruments are generally based on threemonth libor or if the maturities are longer than three months the returns are generally swapped into us dollar threemonth liborbased returns we considered the historical volatility of the interest rates experienced in prior years and the duration of our investment portfolio and debt issuances and determined that it was reasonably possible that an adverse change of 80 basis points 080 approximately 17 of the rate at december 29 2007 15 of the rate at december 30 2006 could be experienced in the near term a hypothetical 080 decrease in interest rates after taking into account hedges and offsetting positions would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our net investment position of approximately 65 million as of december 29 2007 and 50 million as of december 30 2006 the decline reflects only the direct impact of the change in interest rates other economic variables such as equity market fluctuations and changes in relative credit risk could result in a significantly higher decline in our net investment portfolio 

 

equity prices 

 

our marketable investments include marketable equity securities equity derivative instruments such as warrants and options and marketable equity method investments to the extent that our marketable equity securities have strategic value we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposure however for our investments in strategic equity derivative instruments including warrants we may enter into transactions to reduce or eliminate the market risks for securities that we no longer consider strategic we evaluate legal market and economic factors in our decision on the timing of disposal and whether it is possible and appropriate to hedge the equity market risk 

 

the marketable equity securities included in trading assets are held to generate returns that offset changes in liabilities related to the equity market risk of certain deferred compensation arrangements the gains and losses from changes in fair value of these equity securities are generally offset by the gains and losses on the related liabilities resulting in a net exposure of less than 10 million as of december 29 2007 and december 30 2006 assuming a reasonably possible decline in market prices of approximately 10 in the near term 

 

as of december 29 2007 the fair value of our marketable equity securities and equity derivative instruments including hedging positions was 10 billion 427 million as of december 30 2006 our investments in vmware and micron constituted 92 of our marketable equity securities as of december 29 2007 and were carried at a fair market value of 794 million and 123 million respectively our marketable equity method investment had a carrying value of 508 million and a fair value of 522 million as of december 29 2007 

to assess the market price sensitivity of our marketable equity investments we analyzed the historical movements over the past several years of hightechnology stock indices that we considered appropriate for our investments in companies that have been publicly traded for only a limited time we analyzed the implied volatility of the related company based on freely traded options our marketable equity method investment is excluded from our analysis as the carrying value does not fluctuate based on market price changes therefore the potential fair value decline would not be indicative of the impact on our financial statements unless an otherthantemporary impairment was deemed necessary based on our sensitivity analysis we estimated that it was reasonably possible that the prices of the stocks of our marketable equity securities could experience a loss of 55 in the near term 30 as of december 30 2006 assuming a loss of 55 in market prices and after reflecting the impact of hedges and offsetting positions the aggregate value of our marketable equity investments could decrease by approximately 565 million based on the value as of december 29 2007 a decrease in value of 134 million based on the value as of december 30 2006 using an assumed loss of 30 this estimate is not necessarily indicative of future performance and actual results may differ materially the increase in exposure from december 30 2006 to december 29 2007 is due to our purchase of vmware during 2007 its stock price volatility and the weight of our investment in vmware in relation to our total marketable equity securities 

 

many of the same factors that could result in an adverse movement of equity market prices affect our nonmarketable equity investments although we cannot quantify the impact directly such a movement and the underlying economic conditions would negatively affect the prospects of the companies we invest in their ability to raise additional capital and the likelihood of our being able to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings mergers and private sales these types of investments involve a great deal of risk and there can be no assurance that any specific company will grow or become successful consequently we could lose all or part of our investment our nonmarketable equity investments excluding investments accounted for under the equity method had a carrying amount of 805 million as of december 29 2007 733 million as of december 30 2006 the carrying amount of these investments approximated fair value as of december 29 2007 and december 30 2006 as of december 29 2007 the carrying amount of our nonmarketable equity method investments was 26 billion 20 billion as of december 30 2006 and consisted primarily of our investment in imft of 22 billion 13 billion as of december 30 2006

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

 

there were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

 

management report on internal control over financial reporting 

 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 

 

management assessed our internal control over financial reporting as of december 29 2007 the end of our fiscal year management based its assessment on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission management’s assessment included evaluation of elements such as the design and operating effectiveness of key financial reporting controls process documentation accounting policies and our overall control environment 

 

based on our assessment management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the fiscal year to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles we reviewed the results of management’s assessment with the audit committee of our board of directors 

 

our independent registered public accounting firm ernst  young llp independently assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting ernst  young has issued an attestation report concurring with management’s assessment which is included at the end of part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

 

inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

 

our management including the ceo and cfo does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures

a microprocessor is the central processing unit cpu of a computer system it processes system data and controls other devices in the system acting as the “brains” of the computer the following aspects of microprocessor design impact overall platform performance 

  

in addition to the performance factors discussed above our intel ® core tm microarchitecture provides other enhanced features that can increase performance or energy efficiency including the following 

 

 

 

other microprocessor capabilities can also enhance system performance or user experience for example we offer microprocessors with intel’s ht technology which allows each processor core to process two threads of instructions simultaneously this capability can provide benefits in one of two ways it helps to run “multithreaded” software which is designed to execute different parts of a program simultaneously or it helps to run multiple software programs simultaneously in a multitasking environment other technologies include intel amt which helps information technology managers diagnose fix and protect enabled systems that are plugged in and connected to a network even if a computer is turned off or has a failed hard drive or operating system and intel vt which provides increased security and management capabilities through the use of virtual partitions that isolate user environments for example by enabling a platform to run multiple operating systems and allowing for the system to isolate viruses from applications within other partitions to take advantage of these features a computer system must have a microprocessor that supports a chipset and bios basic inputoutput system that use and software that is optimized for the technology performance also will vary depending on the system hardware and software used 

 

microprocessors are also used in embedded designs such as industrial equipment pointofsale systems panel pcs automotive informationentertainment systems and medical equipment 

our microprocessor sales generally have followed a seasonal trend however there can be no assurance that this trend will continue historically our sales of microprocessors have been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year consumer purchases of pcs have been higher in the second half of the year primarily due to backtoschool and holiday demand in addition purchases from businesses have tended to be higher in the second half of the year 

 

the chipset operates as the pc’s “nervous system” sending data between the microprocessor and input display and storage devices such as the keyboard mouse monitor hard drive and cd or dvd drive chipsets perform essential logic functions such as balancing the performance of the system and removing bottlenecks chipsets also extend the graphics audio video and other capabilities of many systems based on our microprocessors finally chipsets control the access between the cpu and main memory we offer chipsets compatible with a variety of industryaccepted bus specifications such as the accelerated graphics port agp specification the peripheral components interconnect pci local bus specification and the pci express local bus specification pci express significantly increases the data transfer rate of the original pci specification thereby improving the graphics and inputoutput bandwidth and enabling an improved multimedia experience we believe that our customers also want memory architecture alternatives and as a result we offer chipsets supporting double data rate ddr and ddr2 secondgeneration faster ddr memory dynamic random access memory dram synchronous dram sdram and fully buffered dual inline memory module fbdimm

manufacturing and assembly and test 

 

as of yearend 2006 68 of our wafer manufacturing including microprocessor chipset nor flash memory and communications silicon fabrication was conducted within the us at our facilities in arizona new mexico oregon massachusetts california and colorado 1  outside the us 32 of our manufacturing was conducted at our facilities in ireland and israel 

 

as of december 2006 we primarily manufactured our products in the wafer fabrication facilities described below 

 

 

 

  

we expect to increase the capacity of certain facilities listed above through additional investments in capital equipment in addition to our current facilities we are building facilities in arizona and israel that in 2007 and 2008 respectively are expected to begin wafer fabrication for microprocessors on 300mm wafers using 45nanometer technology 

 

as of yearend 2006 the majority of our microprocessors were manufactured on 300mm wafers using our 65nanometer process technology in 2007 we expect to begin manufacturing microprocessors on our 45nanometer process technology the next generation of advanced highvolume production process technology beyond our 65nanometer process technology as we move to each succeeding generation of manufacturing process technology we incur significant startup costs to prepare each factory for manufacturing however continuing to advance our process technology provides benefits that we believe justify these costs these benefits can include utilizing less space per transistor which decreases the size of the chip andor enables us to increase the number of integrated features on each chip reducing heat output from each transistor and improving power efficiency these advancements can result in higher performing microprocessors products that consume less power andor products that cost less to manufacture to augment capacity in the us and internationally we use thirdparty manufacturing companies foundries to manufacture wafers for certain components including chipset networking and communications products 

 

our nand flash memory products are manufactured by imft a nand flash memory manufacturing company that we formed with micron we currently purchase 49 of the manufactured output of imft see “note 17 venture” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

 

we primarily use subcontractors to manufacture boardlevel products and systems and purchase certain communications networking products from external vendors primarily in the asiapacific region we also manufacture microprocessor and networkingrelated boardlevel products primarily in malaysia 

following the manufacturing process the majority of our components are subject to assembly and test we perform a substantial majority of our components assembly and test at facilities in malaysia the philippines china and costa rica we plan to continue investing in new assembly and test technologies as well as increasing the capacity of our existing facilities and building new facilities to keep pace with our microprocessor chipset flash memory and communications technology improvements in line with these plans we plan to build a new assembly and test facility in vietnam which is expected to begin production in 2009 this facility will have greater square footage than our current facilities which will enable us to take advantage of greater efficiencies of scale to augment capacity we use subcontractors to perform assembly of certain products primarily flash memory chipsets and networking and communications products assembly and test of nand flash memory products manufactured by imft is performed by micron and other external subcontractors 

 

our performance expectations for business integrity ethics and environmental health and safety compliance are the same regardless of whether our supplier and subcontractor operations are based in the us or elsewhere our employment practices are consistent with and we expect our suppliers and subcontractors to abide by local country law in addition we impose a minimum employee age requirement regardless of local law 

 

we have thousands of suppliers including subcontractors providing our various materials and service needs we set expectations for supplier performance and reinforce those expectations with periodic assessments we communicate those expectations to our suppliers regularly and work with them to implement improvements when necessary we seek where possible to have several sources of supply for all of these materials and resources but we may rely on a single or limited number of suppliers or upon suppliers in a single country in those cases we develop and implement plans and actions to reduce the exposure that would result from a disruption in supply 

 

our products typically are produced at multiple intel facilities at various sites around the world or by subcontractors who have multiple facilities however some products are produced in only one intel or subcontractor facility and we seek to implement actions and plans to reduce the exposure that would result from a disruption at any such facility on a worldwide basis we regularly evaluate our key infrastructure systems services and suppliers both internally and externally to seek to identify significant vulnerabilities as well as areas of potential business impact if a disruptive event were to occur once vulnerability is identified we assess the risks and as we consider it to be appropriate we initiate actions intended to reduce the risks and their potential impact however there can be no assurance that we have identified all significant risks or that we can mitigate all identified risks with reasonable effort see “risk factors” in part i item 1a of this form 10k 

 

we maintain a program of insurance coverage for various types of property casualty and other risks we place our insurance coverage with various carriers in numerous jurisdictions the policies are subject to deductibles and exclusions that result in our retention of a level of risk on a selfinsurance basis the types and amounts of insurance obtained vary from time to time and from location to location depending on availability cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention our worldwide risk and insurance programs are regularly evaluated to seek to obtain the most favorable terms and conditions 

 

research and development 

 

we continue to be committed to investing in worldclass technology development particularly in the area of the design and manufacture of integrated circuits research and development rd expenditures in 2006 amounted to 59 billion 51 billion in fiscal year 2005 and 48 billion in fiscal year 2004 the increase in rd expenditures was primarily due to sharebased compensation effects of 487 million see “note 3 employee equity incentive plans” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

 

our rd activities are directed toward developing innovations that we believe will deliver the next generation of products and platforms which will in turn enable new form factors and new usage models for businesses and consumers we are focusing our rd efforts on advanced computing communications and wireless technologies by developing new microarchitectures advancing our silicon manufacturing process technology delivering the next generation of microprocessors and chipsets improving our platform initiatives and developing software solutions and tools to support our technologies in line with these efforts we plan to introduce a new microarchitecture approximately every two years and ramp the next generation of silicon process technology in the intervening years our rd efforts enable new levels of performance and address areas such as scalability for multicore architectures system manageability energy efficiency digital content protection and new communication capabilities our leadership in silicon technology has enabled us to make “moore’s law” a reality moore’s law predicted that transistor density on integrated circuits would double about every two years our leadership in silicon technology helps to continue to make moore’s law a reality while also bringing new capabilities into silicon and producing new products and platforms optimized for a wider variety of applications we have completed development of our 45nanometer process technology and we expect to begin manufacturing products using our 45nanometer process technology in the second half of 2007 in the area of wireless communications our initiatives focus on delivering the technologies that will enable improved wireless capabilities including expanding and proliferating wimax technologies and products 

 

we do not expect that all of our research and product development projects will result in products that are ultimately released for sale we may terminate research andor product development before completion or decide not to manufacture and sell a developed product for a variety of reasons for example we may decide that a product might not be sufficiently competitive in the relevant market segment or for technological or marketing reasons we may decide to offer a different product instead 

 

our rd model is based on a global organization that emphasizes a collaborative approach in identifying and developing new technologies leading standards initiatives and influencing regulatory policy to accelerate the adoption of new technologies our rd initiatives are performed by various business groups within the company and we centrally manage key crossbusiness group product initiatives to align and prioritize our rd activities across these groups in addition we may augment our rd initiatives by investing in companies that are focused on the same areas as our research and development we also work with a worldwide network of academic and industry researchers scientists and engineers in the computing and communications fields our network of technology professionals allows us as well as others in our industry to benefit from development initiatives in a variety of areas eventually leading to innovative technologies for users we believe that we are well positioned in the technology industry to help drive innovation foster collaboration and promote industry standards that will yield innovative and improved technologies for users 

 

we have an agreement with micron for joint development of nand flash memory technologies costs incurred by intel and micron for process development are generally split evenly as the owner of the product designs intel assumes the cost for product development and licenses certain product designs to micron on a royaltybearing basis 

 

we perform a majority of our rd in the us we have been increasing our product development outside the us and have activities at various locations primarily within israel malaysia india china and russia we also maintain rd facilities in the us focused on developing and improving manufacturing processes as well as facilities in the us malaysia and the philippines dedicated to improvements in assembly and test processes 

 

employees 

 

in september 2006 we announced a restructuring plan that included expected headcount reductions primarily through workforce reductions attrition and targeted divestitures these actions have resulted in headcount reductions during 2006 see “results of operations” within “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in part ii item 7 of this form 10k for further details regarding our restructuring actions as of december 30 2006 we had approximately 94100 employees worldwide with more than 50 of these employees located in the us as of december 31 2005 we had approximately 99900 employees worldwide 

 

sales and marketing 

 

most of our products are sold or licensed through sales offices located near major concentrations of users throughout the asiapacific americas europe and japan regions our business relies on continued sales growth in both mature and emerging markets 

 

sales of our products are typically made via purchase orders that contain standard terms and conditions covering matters such as pricing payment terms and warranties as well as indemnities for issues specific to our products such as patent and copyright indemnities from time to time we may enter into additional agreements with customers covering for example changes from our standard terms and conditions new product development and marketing privatelabel branding and other matters most of our sales are made using electronic and webbased processes that allow the customer to review inventory availability and track the progress of specific goods under order pricing on particular products may vary based on volumes ordered and other factors 

 

we sell our products to oems and odms odms provide design andor manufacturing services to branded and unbranded privatelabel resellers we also sell our products to industrial and retail distributors in certain instances we have entered into supply agreements to continue to manufacture and sell products within divested business lines to acquiring companies during certain transition periods in 2006 dell inc accounted for 19 of our net revenue and hewlettpackard company accounted for 16 of our net revenue no other customer accounted for more than 10 of our net revenue for information about revenue and operating profit by operating segment and revenue from unaffiliated customers by geographic regioncountry see “note 20 operating segment and geographic information” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in part ii item 7 of this form 10k 

 

typically distributors handle a wide variety of products including those that compete with our products and fill orders for many customers most of our sales to distributors are made under agreements allowing for price protection on unsold merchandise and a right of return on stipulated quantities of unsold merchandise we also utilize thirdparty sales representatives who generally do not offer directly competitive products but may carry complementary items manufactured by others sales representatives do not maintain a product inventory instead their customers place orders directly with us or through distributors 

 

our worldwide reseller sales channel consists of thousands of indirect customers who are systems builders and purchase intel microprocessors and other products from our distributors we have a “boxed processor program” that allows distributors to sell intel microprocessors in small quantities to these systemsbuilder customers boxed processors are also made available in direct retail outlets 

 

our corporate marketing focus is on multicore microprocessors which include intel core 2 duo intel core 2 extreme and intel core 2 quad processors these processors are at the center of intel’s most advanced platforms which include intel centrino mobile technology intel vpro technology and intel viiv technology the intel core 2 quad intel core 2 extreme intel core 2 duo itanium intel xeon pentium and celeron trademarks make up our processor brands we promote brand awareness and generate demand through our own direct marketing as well as comarketing programs our direct marketing activities include television print and webbased advertising as well as press relations consumer and trade events and industry and consumer communications we market to consumer and business audiences and focus on building awareness and generating demand for increased performance power efficiency and new capabilities 

 

purchases by customers often allow them to participate in cooperative advertising and marketing programs such as the intel inside ® program through the intel inside program certain customers are licensed to place intel logos on computers containing our microprocessors and our other technology and to use our brands in marketing activities the program includes a market development component that accrues funds based on purchases and partially reimburses the oems for marketing activities for products featuring intel brands subject to the oems meeting defined criteria this program broadens the reach of our brands beyond the scope of our own direct advertising in addition it provides us with the opportunity to do joint marketing with certain customers 

 

our products are typically shipped under terms that transfer title to the customer even in arrangements for which the recognition of revenue on the sale is deferred our standard terms and conditions of sale typically provide that payment is due at a later date generally 30 days after shipment delivery or the customer’s use of the product our credit department sets accounts receivable and shipping limits for individual customers for the purpose of controlling credit risk to intel arising from outstanding account balances we assess credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis and from this analysis we establish credit limits and determine whether we will seek to use one or more credit support devices such as obtaining some form of thirdparty guaranty or standby letter of credit or obtaining credit insurance for all or a portion of the account balance credit losses may still be incurred due to bankruptcy fraud or other failure of the customer to pay see “schedule ii—valuation and qualifying accounts” in part iv of this form 10k for information about our allowance for doubtful receivables 

 

backlog 

 

we do not believe that backlog as of any particular date is meaningful as our sales are made primarily pursuant to standard purchase orders for delivery of products only a small portion of our orders are noncancelable and the dollar amount associated with the noncancelable portion is not significant 

 

competition 

 

our products compete primarily on the basis of performance features quality brand recognition price and availability our ability to compete depends on our ability to provide innovative products and worldwide support for our customers at competitive prices including providing improved energyefficient performance enhanced security reduced heat output manageability and integrated solutions in addition to our various computing networking and communications products we offer platforms that incorporate various components which bring together a collection of technologies that we believe create a better enduser solution than if the ingredients were used separately 

 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid advances in technology and new product introductions as unit volumes of a particular product grow production experience is accumulated and costs typically decrease further competition develops and as a result prices decline the life cycle of our products is very short sometimes less than a year our ability to compete depends on our ability to improve our products and processes faster than our competitors anticipate changing customer requirements and develop and launch new products and platforms while reducing our average per unit costs when we believe it is appropriate we will take various steps including introducing new products and platforms discontinuing older products reducing prices and offering rebates and other incentives to increase acceptance of our latest products and to be competitive within each relevant market segment our products compete with products developed for similar or rival architectures and with products based on the same or rival standards we cannot predict which competing standards will become the prevailing standards in the market segments in which we compete see “risk factors” in part i item 1a of this form 10k 

 

many companies compete with us in the various computing networking and communications market segments and are engaged in the same basic business activities including research and development worldwide these competitors range in size from large established multinational companies with multiple product lines to smaller companies and new entrants to the marketplace that compete in specialized market segments some of our competitors may have development agreements with other companies and in some cases our competitors may also be our customers andor suppliers product offerings may cross over into multiple product categories offering us new opportunities but also resulting in more competition it may be difficult for us to compete in market segments where our competitors have established products and brand recognition 

 

we believe that our network of manufacturing facilities and assembly and test facilities gives us a competitive advantage this network enables us to have more direct control over our processes quality control product cost volume timing of production and other factors these facilities require significant upfront capital spending and many of our competitors do not own such facilities because they cannot afford to do so or because their business models involve the use of thirdparty facilities for manufacturing and assembly and test these “fabless semiconductor companies” include broadcom corporation nvidia corporation qualcomm incorporated and via technologies inc via some of our competitors own portions of such facilities through investment or jointventure arrangements with other companies there is a group of thirdparty manufacturing companies foundries and assembly and test subcontractors that offers their services to companies without owned facilities or companies needing additional capacity these foundries and subcontractors may also offer intellectual property design services and other goods and services to our competitors competitors who outsource their manufacturing and assembly and test operations can significantly reduce their capital expenditures 

 

we plan to continue to cultivate new businesses and work with the computing and communications industries through standards bodies trade associations oems odms and independent software and operating system vendors to help align the industry to offer products that take advantage of the latest market trends and usage models these efforts include helping to build out the infrastructure for wireless network connectivity we are also working with these industries to develop software applications and operating systems that take advantage of our platforms through programs such as the intel ® software partner program which provides opportunities that help companies develop market and sell solutions that take advantage of the latest intel platforms and technologies we frequently participate in industry initiatives designed to discuss and agree upon technical specifications and other aspects of technologies that could be adopted as standards by standardssetting organizations in addition we work collaboratively with other companies to protect digital content and the consumer by developing content protection specifications such as the digital transmission content protection dtcp specification dtcp defines a secure protocol for protecting audio and video entertainment content from illegal copying intercepting and tampering as it moves across digital interfaces such as universal serial bus usb and ipbased home networks our competitors may also participate in the same initiatives and specification development our participation does not ensure that any standards or specifications adopted by these organizations will be consistent with our product planning we continuously evaluate our product offerings and the timing of their introductions taking into account factors such as customer requirements and availability of infrastructure to take advantage of product features performance and maturity of application software for each type of product in the relevant market segments 

 

companies in the semiconductor industry often rely on the ability to license patents from each other in order to compete in today’s markets many of our competitors have broad crosslicenses or licenses with us and under current case law some such licenses may permit these competitors to pass our patent rights on to others if one of these licensees becomes a foundry our competitors might be able to avoid our patent rights in manufacturing competing products in addition to licensing our patents to competitors we participate in some industry organizations that are engaged in the development of standards or specifications and may require us to license our patents to other companies that adopt such industry standards or specifications even when such organizations do not adopt the standards or specifications proposed by intel any intel patents that may be subject to the licensing policies of such organizations due to our participation in such initiatives might not in some situations be available for us to enforce against others who might be infringing those patents see “risk factors” in part i item 1a of this form 10k 

 

we continue to be largely dependent on the success of our microprocessor business our ability to compete depends on our ability to deliver new microprocessor products with improved overall performance andor improved energyefficient performance at competitive prices many of our competitors including advanced micro devices inc amd our primary microprocessor competitor market softwarecompatible products that compete with our processors we also face competition from companies offering rival microarchitecture designs such as cell broadband engine architecture developed jointly by international business machines corporation ibm sony corporation and toshiba corporation our desktop processors compete with products offered by amd ibm and via among others our mobile microprocessor products compete with products offered by amd ibm transmeta corporation and via among others our server processors compete with softwarecompatible products offered by amd and with products based on rival architectures including the serviceoriented architecture soa offered by ibm and the scalable processor architecture sparc offered by sun microsystems inc 

 

our chipsets compete in the various market segments against different types of chipsets that support either our microprocessor products or rival microprocessor products competing chipsets are produced by companies such as ati technologies inc recently acquired by amd nvidia silicon integrated systems corporation sis and via we also compete with companies offering graphics components and other specialpurpose products used in the desktop mobile and server market segments one aspect of our business model is to incorporate improved performance and advanced properties into our microprocessors and chipsets the demand for which may increasingly be affected by competition from companies such as nvidia whose business models are based on incorporating improved performance into dedicated chipsets and other components such as graphics controllers 

 

our nor and nand flash memory products currently compete with the products of other companies such as hynix semiconductor inc micron samsung electronics co ltd spansion inc stmicroelectronics nv and toshiba 

 

we offer products designed for wired and wireless connectivity for the communications infrastructure including network processors and for networked storage these products currently compete against offerings from companies such as applied micro circuits corporation amd broadcom freescale semiconductor inc ibm opnext inc sun microsystems and via 

 

we also offer platforms for the desktop mobile and server market segments that integrate components that enable targeted usage models we believe that our platform offerings give us a competitive advantage our platforms are designed to meet the specific needs of end users and are optimized to deliver increased security and manageability energyefficient performance and other innovative solutions embedded into our microprocessors with amd’s acquisition of ati technologies we anticipate increased platform competition in various market segments 

 

acquisitions and strategic investments 

 

during 2006 the company did not complete any acquisitions qualifying as business combinations in 2006 intel formed imft a nand flash memory manufacturing company with micron intel invested 13 billion in return for a 49 interest see “note 17 venture” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k also during 2006 intel paid 600 million for an investment in clearwire corporation clearwire builds and operates nextgeneration wireless broadband networks see “note 7 investments” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

 

intellectual property and licensing 

 

intellectual property rights that apply to our various products and services include patents copyrights trade secrets trademarks and maskwork rights we maintain an active program to protect our investment in technology by attempting to ensure respect for our intellectual property rights the extent of the legal protection given to different types of intellectual property rights varies under different countries’ legal systems we intend to license our intellectual property rights where we can obtain adequate consideration see “competition” in part i item 1 of this form 10k “legal proceedings” in part i item 3 of this form 10k and “risk factors” in part i item 1a of this form 10k 

we have filed and obtained a number of patents in the us and abroad while our patents are an important element of our success our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any one patent we and other companies in the computing telecommunications and related hightechnology fields typically apply for and receive in the aggregate tens of thousands of overlapping patents annually in the us and other countries we believe that the duration of the applicable patents we are granted is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products because of the fast pace of innovation and product development our products are often obsolete before the patents related to them expire and sometimes are obsolete before the patents related to them are even granted as we expand our product offerings into new industries such as consumer electronics we also seek to extend our patent development efforts to patent such product offerings established competitors in existing and new industries as well as companies that purchase and enforce patents and other intellectual property may already have patents covering similar products there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain patents covering our own products or that we will be able to obtain licenses from such companies on favorable terms or at all 

 

the large majority of the software we distribute including software embedded in our component and systemlevel products is entitled to copyright protection 

 

to distinguish intel products from our competitors’ products we have obtained certain trademarks and trade names for our products and we maintain cooperative advertising programs with certain customers to promote our brands and to identify products containing genuine intel components 

 

we also protect certain details about our processes products and strategies as trade secrets keeping confidential the information that we believe provides us with a competitive advantage we have ongoing programs designed to maintain the confidentiality of such information 

 

compliance with environmental health and safety regulations 

 

intel is committed to achieving high standards of environmental quality and product safety and strives to provide a safe and healthy workplace for our employees contractors and the communities in which we do business we have environmental health and safety ehs policies and expectations that apply to our global operations each of intel’s worldwide production facilities is registered to the international organization for standardization iso 14001 environmental management system standard intel’s internal ehs auditing program addresses not only compliance but also business risk and management systems we focus on minimizing and properly managing hazardous materials used in our facilities and products we monitor regulatory and resource trends and set companywide short and longterm performance targets for key resources and emissions these targets address several parameters including energy and water use climate change waste recycling and emissions for example we continue to take action to achieve our global energy reduction goal by investing in energy conservation projects in our factories and working with suppliers of manufacturing tools to improve energy efficiency intel also is focused on developing innovative solutions to improve the energy efficiency of our products and those of our customers intel has taken a holistic approach to power management addressing the challenge at all levels including the silicon package circuit micromacro architecture platform and software levels 

 

the production of intel products requires the use of hazardous materials that are subject to a broad array of ehs laws and regulations intel actively monitors the materials used in the production of our products intel has specific restrictions on the content of certain hazardous materials in our products as well as those of our suppliers and outsourced manufacturers and subcontractors intel continues to make efforts to reduce hazardous materials in our products to position us to meet various environmental restrictions on product content throughout the world as intel continues to advance process technology the materials technologies and products themselves become increasingly complex our evaluations of materials for use in rd and production take into account ehs considerations compliance with these complex laws and regulations as well as internal voluntary programs is integrated into intel’s design for ehs programs 

 

intel is committed to the protection of human rights and the environment throughout its supply chain intel expects suppliers to understand and fully comply with all ehs and related laws and regulations in addition suppliers are expected to abide by intel’s policies such as its corporate business principles and the electronics industry code of conduct maintain progressive employment practices and comply with other applicable laws including at a minimum those covering nondiscrimination in the terms and conditions of employment child labor minimum wages employee benefits and work hours

 item 1a risk factors 

 

fluctuations in demand for our products may adversely affect our financial results and are difficult to forecast 

if demand for our products fluctuates our revenue and gross margin could be adversely affected important factors that could cause demand for our products to fluctuate include 

  

if demand for our products is reduced our manufacturing andor assembly and test capacity could be underutilized and we may be required to record an impairment on our longlived assets including facilities and equipment as well as intangible assets which would increase our expenses in addition factory planning decisions may shorten the useful lives of longlived assets including facilities and equipment and cause us to accelerate depreciation in the long term if demand for our products increases we may not be able to add manufacturing andor assembly and test capacity fast enough to meet market demand these changes in demand for our products and changes in our customers’ product needs could have a variety of negative effects on our competitive position and our financial results and in certain cases may reduce our revenue increase our costs lower our gross margin percentage or require us to recognize impairments of our assets in addition if demand for our products is reduced or we fail to accurately forecast demand we could be required to write down inventory which would have a negative impact on our gross margin 

 

the semiconductor industry and our operations are characterized by a high percentage of costs that are fixed or otherwise difficult to reduce in the short term and by product demand that is highly variable and subject to significant downturns that may adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the semiconductor industry and our operations are characterized by high costs such as those related to facility construction and equipment research and development and employment and training of a highly skilled workforce that are either fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term at the same time demand for our products is highly variable and there have been downturns often in connection with maturing product cycles as well as downturns in general economic market conditions these downturns have been characterized by reduced product demand manufacturing overcapacity high inventory levels and lower average selling prices the combination of these factors may cause our revenue gross margin cash flow and profitability to vary significantly in both the short and long term 

 

we operate in intensely competitive industries and our failure to respond quickly to technological developments and incorporate new features into our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to compete 

we operate in intensely competitive industries that experience rapid technological developments changes in industry standards changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and improvements if we are unable to respond quickly and successfully to these developments we may lose our competitive position and our products or technologies may become uncompetitive or obsolete to compete successfully we must maintain a successful rd effort develop new products and production processes and improve our existing products and processes at the same pace or ahead of our competitors we may not be able to successfully develop and market these new products the products we invest in and develop may not be well received by customers and products developed and new technologies offered by others may affect the demand for our products these types of events could have a variety of negative effects on our competitive position and our financial results such as reducing our revenue increasing our costs lowering our gross margin percentage and requiring us to recognize impairments of our assets 

 

fluctuations in the mix of products sold may adversely affect our financial results 

because of the wide price differences among mobile desktop and server microprocessors the mix and types of performance capabilities of microprocessors sold affect the average selling price of our products and have a substantial impact on our revenue our financial results also depend in part on the mix of other products we sell such as chipsets flash memory and other semiconductor products in addition more recently introduced products tend to have higher associated costs because of initial overall development costs and higher startup costs fluctuations in the mix and types of our products may also affect the extent to which we are able to recover our fixed costs and investments that are associated with a particular product and as a result can negatively impact our financial results 

 

our global operations subject us to risks that may negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we have sales offices research and development manufacturing and assembly and test facilities in many countries and as a result we are subject to risks associated with doing business globally our global operations may be subject to risks that may limit our ability to manufacture assemble and test design develop or sell products in particular countries which could in turn have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition including 

  

in addition although most of our products are priced and paid for in us dollars a significant amount of certain types of expenses such as payroll utilities tax and marketing expenses are paid in local currencies our hedging programs reduce but do not always entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements and therefore fluctuations in exchange rates including those caused by currency controls could negatively impact our business operating results and financial condition by resulting in lower revenue or increased expenses in addition changes in tariff and import regulations and to us and nonus monetary policies may also negatively impact our revenue in those affected countries varying tax rates in different jurisdictions could negatively impact our overall tax rate 

 

failure to meet our production targets resulting in undersupply or oversupply of products may adversely impact our business and results of operations 

production of integrated circuits is a complex process disruptions in this process can result from difficulties in our development and implementation of new processes errors and interruptions in the processes defects in materials and disruptions in our supply of materials or resources—all of which could affect the timing of production ramps and yields furthermore we may not be successful or efficient in developing or implementing new production processes the occurrence of any of the foregoing may result in our failure to increase production as desired resulting in higher costs or substantial decreases in yields which could impact our ability to produce sufficient volume to meet specific product demand furthermore the unavailability or reduced availability of certain products could make it more difficult to implement our platform strategy we may also experience increases in yields a substantial increase in yields could result in higher inventory levels and the possibility of resulting excess capacity charges as we slow production to reduce inventory levels the occurrence of any of these events could adversely impact our business and results of operations 

 

we may have difficulties obtaining the resources or products we need for manufacturing or assembling our products or operating other aspects of our business which could adversely affect our ability to meet demand for our products and may increase our costs 

we have thousands of suppliers providing various materials that we use in production of our products and other aspects of our business and we seek where possible to have several sources of supply for all of these materials however we may rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers or upon suppliers in a single country for these materials the inability of such suppliers to deliver adequate supplies of production materials or other supplies could disrupt our production processes or could make it more difficult for us to implement our platform strategy in addition production could be disrupted by the unavailability of the resources used in production such as water silicon electricity and gases the unavailability or reduced availability of the materials or resources we use in our business may require us to reduce production of products or may require us to incur additional costs in order to obtain an adequate supply of these materials or resources the occurrence of any of these events could adversely impact our business and results of operations 

 

costs related to product defects and errata may have an adverse impact on our results of operations and business 

costs associated with unexpected product defects and errata deviations from published specifications include for example the costs of 

  

these costs could be substantial and may therefore increase our expenses and adversely affect our gross margin in addition our reputation with our customers or end users of our products could be damaged as a result of such product defects and errata and the demand for our products could be reduced these factors could negatively impact our financial results and the prospects for our business 

we may be subject to claims of infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights which could adversely affect our business 

from time to time third parties may assert against us or our customers alleged patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our business we may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims from certain individuals and companies who have acquired patent portfolios for the sole purpose of asserting such claims against other companies any claims that our products or processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others regardless of the merit or resolution of such claims could cause us to incur significant costs in responding to defending and resolving such claims and may divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel away from our business as a result of such intellectual property infringement claims we could be required or otherwise decide it is appropriate to 

  

the occurrence of any of the foregoing could result in unexpected expenses or require us to recognize an impairment of our assets which would reduce the value of our assets and increase expenses in addition if we alter or discontinue our production of affected items our revenue could be negatively impacted 

 

we may be subject to litigation proceedings that could adversely affect our business 

in addition to the litigation risks mentioned above we may be subject to legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder consumer antitrust and other issues as described in “legal proceedings” in part i item 3 of this form 10k we are currently engaged in a number of litigation matters litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur an unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or in cases for which injunctive relief is sought an injunction prohibiting intel from manufacturing or selling one or more products were an unfavorable ruling to occur there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on business and results of operations for the period in which the ruling occurred or future periods 

 

we may not be able to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights which may harm our ability to compete and adversely affect our business 

our ability to enforce our patents copyrights software licenses and other intellectual property is subject to general litigation risks as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our intellectual property rights in various countries when we seek to enforce our rights we are often subject to claims that the intellectual property right is invalid is otherwise not enforceable or is licensed to the party against whom we are asserting a claim in addition our assertion of intellectual property rights often results in the other party seeking to assert alleged intellectual property rights of its own against us which may adversely impact our business in the manner discussed above if we are not ultimately successful in defending ourselves against these claims in litigation we may not be able to sell a particular product or family of products due to an injunction or we may have to pay material amounts of damages which could in turn negatively affect our results of operations in addition governments may adopt regulations or courts may render decisions requiring compulsory licensing of intellectual property to others or governments may require that products meet specified standards that serve to favor local companies our inability to enforce our intellectual property rights under these circumstances may negatively impact our competitive position and our business 

 

our licenses with other companies and our participation in industry initiatives may allow other companies including competitors to use our patent rights 

companies in the semiconductor industry often rely on the ability to license patents from each other in order to compete many of our competitors have broad licenses or crosslicenses with us and under current case law some of these licenses may permit these competitors to pass our patent rights on to others if one of these licensees becomes a foundry our competitors might be able to avoid our patent rights in manufacturing competing products in addition our participation in industry initiatives may require us to license our patents to other companies that adopt certain industry standards or specifications even when such organizations do not adopt standards or specifications proposed by us as a result our patents implicated by our participation in industry initiatives might not be available for us to enforce against others who might otherwise be deemed to be infringing those patents our costs of enforcing our licenses or protecting our patents may increase and the value of our intellectual property may be impaired 

 

changes in our decisions with regard to our announced restructuring and efficiency project and other factors could affect our results of operations and financial condition 

factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations with regard to our announced restructuring include 

  

in order to compete we must attract retain and motivate key employees and our failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

in order to compete we must attract retain and motivate executives and other key employees including those in managerial technical sales marketing and support positions hiring and retaining qualified executives scientists engineers technical staff and sales representatives are critical to our business and competition for experienced employees in the semiconductor industry can be intense to help attract retain and motivate qualified employees we use sharebased incentive awards such as employee stock options and nonvested share units restricted stock units if the value of such stock awards does not appreciate as measured by the performance of the price of our common stock andor if our other sharebased compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit our ability to attract retain and motivate employees could be adversely impacted which could negatively affect our results of operations 

 

our results of operations could vary as a result of the methods estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies 

the methods estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations see “critical accounting estimates” in part ii item 7 of this form 10k such methods estimates and judgments are by their nature subject to substantial risks uncertainties and assumptions and factors may arise over time that lead us to change our methods estimates and judgments changes in those methods estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations in particular the calculation of sharebased compensation expense under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” sfas no 123r requires us to use valuation methodologies which were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options and restricted stock units and a number of assumptions estimates and conclusions regarding matters such as expected forfeitures expected volatility of our share price the expected dividend rate with respect to our common stock and the exercise behavior of our employees furthermore there are no means under applicable accounting principles to compare and adjust our expense if and when we learn about additional information that may affect the estimates that we previously made with the exception of changes in expected forfeitures of sharebased awards factors may arise over time that lead us to change our estimates and assumptions with respect to future sharebased compensation arrangements resulting in variability in our sharebased compensation expense over time changes in forecasted sharebased compensation expense could impact our gross margin percentage research and development expenses marketing general and administrative expenses and our tax rate 

 

our failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations worldwide could adversely impact our business and results of operations 

the manufacture and assembly and testing of our products require the use of hazardous materials that are subject to a broad array of environmental health and safety laws and regulations our failure to comply with any of these applicable laws or regulations could result in 

  

in addition our failure to properly manage the use transportation emission discharge storage recycling or disposal of hazardous materials could subject us to increased costs or future liabilities existing and future environmental laws and regulations could also require us to acquire pollution abatement or remediation equipment modify our product designs or incur other expenses associated with such laws and regulations many new materials that we are evaluating for use in our operations may be subject to regulation under existing or future environmental laws and regulations that may restrict our use of certain materials in our manufacturing assembly and test processes or products any of these consequences could adversely impact our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses andor requiring us to alter our manufacturing and assembly and test processes 

changes in our effective tax rate may have an adverse effect on our results of operations our future effective tax rates may be adversely affected by a number of factors including 

  

any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could adversely impact net income for future periods in addition the us internal revenue service irs and other tax authorities regularly examine our income tax returns the irs has proposed adjustments or issued formal assessments related to amounts reflected on certain of our tax returns as a tax benefit for our export sales see “note 19 contingencies” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k our results of operations could be adversely impacted if these assessments or any other assessments resulting from the examination of our income tax returns by the irs or other taxing authorities are not resolved in our favor 

 

we invest in companies for strategic reasons and may not realize a return on our investments 

we make investments in companies around the world to further our strategic objectives and support our key business initiatives such investments include investments in equity securities of public companies and investments in nonmarketable equity securities of private companies which range from earlystage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies whose products or technologies may directly support an intel product or initiative the success of these companies is dependent on product development market acceptance operational efficiency and other key business success factors the private companies in which we invest may fail because they may not be able to secure additional funding obtain favorable investment terms for future financings or take advantage of liquidity events such as initial public offerings mergers and private sales if any of these private companies fail we could lose all or part of our investment in that company if we determine that an otherthantemporary decline in the fair value exists for the equity securities of the public and private companies in which we invest we write down the investment to its fair value and recognize the related writedown as an investment loss furthermore when the strategic objectives of an investment have been achieved or if the investment or business diverges from our strategic objectives we may decide to dispose of the investment our investments in nonmarketable equity securities of private companies are not liquid and we may not be able to dispose of these investments on favorable terms or at all the occurrence of any of these events could negatively affect our results of operations

 item 3 legal proceedings 

 

  

in connection with the regular examination of intel’s tax returns for the years 1999 through 2005 the irs formally assessed in 2005 and 2006 certain adjustments to the amounts reflected by intel on those returns as a tax benefit for its export sales the company does not agree with these adjustments and has appealed the assessments if the irs prevails in its position intel’s federal income tax due for 1999 through 2005 would increase by approximately 22 billion plus interest in addition the irs will likely make a similar claim for 2006 and if the irs prevails income tax due for 2006 would increase by approximately 200 million plus interest 

 

although the final resolution of the adjustments is uncertain based on currently available information management believes that the ultimate outcome will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position cash flows or overall trends in results of operations there is the possibility of a material adverse impact on the results of operations for the period in which the matter is ultimately resolved if it is resolved unfavorably or in the period in which an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable 

 

  

intel currently is a party to various legal proceedings including those noted below while management presently believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings individually and in the aggregate will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position cash flows or overall trends in results of operations litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur an unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or in cases for which injunctive relief is sought an injunction prohibiting intel from selling one or more products were an unfavorable ruling to occur there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the business or results of operations for the period in which the ruling occurs or future periods

strategy 

 

our goal is to be the preeminent provider of semiconductor chips and platform solutions to the worldwide digital economy as part of our overall strategy to compete in each relevant market segment we use our core competencies in the design and manufacture of integrated circuits as well as our financial resources global presence and brand recognition 

 

our strategy focuses on taking customer needs into account in developing the next generation of products and platforms that will enable new form factors and new usage models for businesses and consumers we believe that end users oems thirdparty vendors and service providers of computing and communications systems and devices want platform products we define a platform as a collection of technologies that are designed to work together to provide a better enduser solution than if the ingredients were used separately our platforms consist of various products based on standards and initiatives hardware and software that may include technologies such as ht technology intel vt and intel amt and services in developing our platforms we may include ingredients sold by other companies the success of our strategy to offer platform solutions is dependent on our ability to select and incorporate ingredients that customers value and to market the platforms effectively we have a tiered brand strategy that addresses our customer needs within various market price points 

 

we also believe that users of computing and communications systems and devices want improved overall performance andor improved energyefficient performance improved overall performance can include faster processing performance and other improved capabilities such as multithreading and multitasking performance can also be improved through enhanced connectivity security manageability utilization reliability ease of use and interoperability among devices improved energyefficient performance involves balancing the addition of these types of improved performance factors with the power consumption of the platform lower power consumption may reduce system heat output provide power savings and reduce the total cost of ownership for the end user it is our goal to incorporate these improvements in our various products and platforms to meet enduser demands in line with these efforts we are focusing on further development of multicore microprocessors multicore microprocessors contain two or more processor cores which enable improved multitasking and energyefficient performance our strategy for developing processors with improved performance is to synchronize the introduction of new microarchitecture with improvements in silicon process technology we plan to introduce a new microarchitecture approximately every two years and ramp the next generation of silicon process technology in the intervening years this coordinated schedule allows us to develop and introduce new products based on a common microarchitecture quickly without waiting for the next generation of silicon process technology

critical accounting estimates 

 

the methods estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements which we discuss under the heading “results of operations” following this section of our mda some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain our most critical accounting estimates include the valuation of nonmarketable equity securities which impacts net gains losses on equity securities when we record impairments the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities which impact our tax provision the assessment of recoverability of longlived assets which primarily impacts gross margin or operating expenses when we record asset impairments or accelerate their depreciation the valuation of inventory which impacts gross margin and the valuation and recognition of sharebased compensation which impact gross margin research and development expenses and marketing general and administrative expenses below we discuss these policies further as well as the estimates and judgments involved we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies such as those for revenue recognition including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors however these policies typically do not require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 

 

nonmarketable equity securities 

 

we typically invest in nonmarketable equity securities of private companies which range from earlystage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies whose products or technologies may directly support an intel product or initiative at december 30 2006 the carrying value of our portfolio of strategic investments in nonmarketable equity securities excluding equity derivatives totaled 28 billion 561 million at december 31 2005 which includes our investments in imft and clearwire 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

investments in nonmarketable equity securities are inherently risky and a number of these companies are likely to fail their success is dependent on product development market acceptance operational efficiency and other key business success factors in addition depending on their future prospects and market conditions they may not be able to raise additional funds when needed or they may receive lower valuations with less favorable investment terms than in previous financings and the investments would likely become impaired 

 

we review our investments quarterly for indicators of impairment however for nonmarketable equity securities the impairment analysis requires significant judgment to identify events or circumstances that would likely have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment the indicators that we use to identify those events or circumstances include a the investee’s revenue and earnings trends relative to predefined milestones and overall business prospects b the technological feasibility of the investee’s products and technologies c the general market conditions in the investee’s industry or geographic area including adverse regulatory or economic changes d factors related to the investee’s ability to remain in business such as the investee’s liquidity debt ratios and the rate at which the investee is using its cash and e the investee’s receipt of additional funding at a lower valuation 

 

investments identified as having an indicator of impairment are subject to further analysis to determine if the investment is other than temporarily impaired in which case the investment is written down to its impaired value and a new cost basis is established when an investee is not considered viable from a financial or technological point of view we write off the investment since we consider the estimated fair value to be nominal if an investee obtains additional funding at a valuation lower than our carrying amount or requires a new round of equity funding to stay in operation and the new funding does not appear imminent we presume that the investment is other than temporarily impaired unless specific facts and circumstances indicate otherwise impairments of investments in our portfolio of nonmarketable equity securities were 79 million in 2006 103 million in 2005 and 115 million in 2004 over the past 12 quarters impairments of investments in our portfolio of nonmarketable equity securities have ranged between 10 million and 41 million per quarter 

 

income taxes 

 

we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits tax benefits and deductions such as the tax benefit for export sales and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 

 

we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets if recovery is not likely we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable we believe that a substantial majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets will ultimately be recovered however should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not probable 

 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional tax payments are probable if we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary this may occur for a variety of reasons such as the expiration of the statute of limitations on a particular tax return or the signing of a final settlement agreement with the relative tax authority we record an additional charge in our provision for taxes in the period in which we determine that the recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be 

 

in june 2006 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes—an interpretation of sfas no 109” the provisions are effective beginning in the first quarter of 2007 see “note 2 accounting policies” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k for further discussion 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

longlived assets 

 

we assess longlived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant underperformance of a business or product line in relation to expectations significant negative industry or economic trends and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets recoverability of assets that will continue to be used in our operations is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to our estimate of the related total future undiscounted net cash flows if an asset grouping’s carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows the asset grouping is considered to be impaired the impairment is measured by the difference between the asset grouping’s carrying amount and its fair value 

 

impairments of longlived assets are determined for groups of assets related to the lowest level of identifiable independent cash flows due to our asset usage model and the interchangeable nature of our semiconductor manufacturing capacity we must make subjective judgments in determining the independent cash flows that can be related to specific asset groupings in addition as we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions we must make subjective judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets primarily processspecific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements when we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated and there are sufficient cash flows to support the carrying value of the assets we accelerate the rate of depreciation charges in order to fully depreciate the assets over their new shorter useful lives impairments and accelerated depreciation of longlived assets were approximately 335 million during 2006 approximately 20 million in 2005 and 50 million in 2004 the amount in 2006 included 317 million of asset impairment charges related to our communications and application processor business for further discussion on these asset impairment charges see “note 11 restructuring and asset impairment charges” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

 

inventory 

 

the valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality the determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products during the second quarter of 2006 we completed a demand forecast accuracy analysis as a result the demand horizon now includes additional weeks of the demand forecast period for certain products compared to prior years and continues to include a review of productspecific facts and circumstances this change did not have a significant impact on gross margin in 2006 the demand forecast is also a direct input in the development of our shortterm manufacturing plans to help enable consistency between inventory valuation and build decisions productspecific facts and circumstances reviewed in the inventory valuation process include a review of the customer base the stage of the product life cycle of our products consumer confidence and customer acceptance of our products as well as an assessment of the selling price in relation to the product cost if our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly or if we fail to accurately forecast the demand we could be required to write down additional inventory which would have a negative impact on our gross margin 

 

sharebased compensation 

 

in the first quarter of 2006 we adopted sfas no 123r which requires the measurement at fair value and recognition of compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards total sharebased compensation during 2006 was 14 billion determining the appropriate fairvalue model and calculating the fair value of employee stock options and rights to purchase shares under stock purchase plans at the date of grant requires judgment we use the blackscholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of these sharebased awards consistent with the provisions of sfas no 123r option pricing models including the blackscholes model also require the use of input assumptions including expected volatility expected life expected dividend rate and expected riskfree rate of return the assumptions for expected volatility and expected life are the two assumptions that significantly affect the grant date fair value the expected dividend rate and expected riskfree rate of return are not significant to the calculation of fair value 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

we use implied volatility based on options freely traded in the open market as we believe implied volatility is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility in determining the appropriateness of implied volatility we considered the volume of market activity of freely traded options and determined that there was sufficient market activity the ability to reasonably match the input variables of options freely traded to those of options granted by the company such as the date of grant and the exercise price and determined that the input assumptions were comparable and the length of term of freely traded options used to derive implied volatility which is generally one to two years and determined that the length of term was sufficient we use the simplified calculation of expected life described in the sec’s staff accounting bulletin 107 due to changes in the vesting terms and contractual life of current option grants compared to our historical grants if we determined that another method used to estimate expected volatility or expected life was more reasonable than our current methods or if another method for calculating these input assumptions was prescribed by authoritative guidance the fair value calculated for sharebased awards could change significantly higher volatility and longer expected lives result in an increase to sharebased compensation determined at the date of grant the effect that changes in the volatility and the expected life would have on the weighted average fair value of grants and the increase in total fair value during 2006 was as follows 

 

 

 

  

in addition sfas no 123r requires us to develop an estimate of the number of sharebased awards that will be forfeited due to employee turnover quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported sharebased compensation as the cumulative effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization after january 1 2006 is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed we estimate and adjust forfeiture rates based on a quarterly review of recent forfeiture activity and expected future employee turnover if a revised forfeiture rate is higher than the previously estimated forfeiture rate an adjustment is made that will result in a decrease to the expense recognized in the financial statements if a revised forfeiture rate is lower than the previously estimated forfeiture rate an adjustment is made that will result in an increase to the expense recognized in the financial statements these adjustments affect our gross margin research and development expenses and marketing general and administrative expenses the effect of forfeiture adjustments in 2006 was insignificant cumulative adjustments are recorded to the extent that the related expense is recognized in the financial statements beginning with implementation in the first quarter of 2006 therefore we expect the potential impact from cumulative forfeiture adjustments to increase in future periods the expense that we recognize in future periods could also differ significantly from the current period andor our forecasts due to adjustments in the assumed forfeiture rates 

 

results of operations 

 

overview 

 

fiscal year 2006 was a challenging year driven by a strong competitive environment lower microprocessor average selling prices significantly impacted our revenue and gross margin our gross margin toward the end of the year was also impacted by higher unit costs resulting from the ramp of dualcore microprocessors and charges from the underutilization of our 90nanometer facilities factory underutilization charges are expected to continue to impact our gross margin during the first quarter of 2007 and startup costs associated with our 45nanometer process technology are expected to impact our gross margin during the first half of 2007 we continued to see a mix shift in microprocessor revenue from desktop to mobile and ended the year with fourthquarter mobile microprocessor revenue surpassing desktop microprocessor revenue for the first time results for 2006 included sharebased compensation charges of 14 billion gains on divestitures of 612 million and restructuring and asset impairment charges of 555 million 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

our spending is trending lower going into 2007 as a result of our ongoing program to improve operational efficiency and reduce ongoing costs across the company through ongoing attrition divestitures and employee terminations we ended the year with our employee headcount at 94100 down from 102500 at midyear and expect our headcount to continue to decline to 92000 by the middle of 2007 we recognized 238 million in restructuring charges related to employee severance and benefit arrangements in addition we have taken actions to focus on our core businesses and have completed three divestitures we recognized 103 million in tool impairments associated with one of the divestitures in addition we have placed for sale a fabrication facility in colorado that resulted in an impairment charge of 214 million overall our ongoing program to improve operational efficiency and results is expected to generate cost savings of 2 billion in 2007 and 3 billion in 2008 of which an estimated 600 million in gross annual savings is a result of currentyear restructuring charges related to employee severance and benefit arrangements a portion of the overall cost savings such as better utilization of assets reduced spending and organizational efficiencies will not result in restructuring charges 

 

outstanding new products leadership in manufacturing technology comprehensive cost savings and disciplined execution have built a foundation for 2007 we continue to drive technology advancements and in 2006 we ramped our 65nanometer process technology introduced the intel core microarchitecture and ended the year with dualcore microprocessors accounting for over half of our fourthquarter shipments additionally in the fourth quarter we began shipping quadcore microprocessors looking forward to 2007 we expect to launch our next generation of intel centrino mobile technology later in the first half of 2007 and microprocessors using 45nanometer process technology are scheduled for production in the second half of 2007 

 

from a financial condition perspective we ended the year with 89 billion in cash and shortterm investments and returned 46 billion to stockholders through stock repurchases and 23 billion as dividends in 2006 

 

the following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of income data as a percentage of net revenue for the periods indicated 

 

 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

effective january 1 2006 the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 123r which is discussed in “note 2 accounting policies” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k the following table summarizes the effects of sharebased compensation resulting from the application of sfas no 123r 

 

 

 

the following table sets forth revenue information of geographic regions for the periods indicated 

 

 

 

our net revenue was 354 billion in 2006 a decrease of 9 compared to 2005 substantially all of the decrease was due to significantly lower average selling prices of microprocessors fiscal year 2006 was a 52week fiscal year in contrast to fiscal year 2005 which was a 53week fiscal year 

 

revenue in the asiapacific region decreased 10 and revenue in the europe region decreased 20 compared to 2005 these decreases were slightly offset by revenue in japan which increased slightly compared to 2005 revenue in the americas region was approximately flat compared to 2005 mature and emerging markets both declined in 2006 compared to 2005 the decrease within mature markets occurred in the europe and asiapacific regions and a substantial majority of the decrease within the emerging markets occurred in the europe and asiapacific regions 

 

our overall gross margin dollars for 2006 were 182 billion a decrease of 48 billion or 21 compared to 2005 our overall gross margin percentage decreased to 515 in 2006 from 594 in 2005 the gross margin percentage for the digital enterprise group and the mobility group were both lower in 2006 compared to 2005 a mix shift of our total revenue to the mobility group which has a higher gross margin percentage slightly offset these decreases to the overall gross margin a substantial majority of our overall gross margin dollars in 2006 and 2005 was derived from the sale of microprocessors the 2006 gross margin included the impact of 349 million of sharebased compensation which we began recognizing in 2006 the 2005 gross margin was affected by a litigation settlement agreement with microunity inc in which we recorded a 140 million charge to cost of sales of which 110 million was allocated to the digital enterprise group and 30 million was allocated to the mobility group see “business outlook” later in this section for a discussion of gross margin expectations 

 

our net revenue for 2005 was 388 billion an increase of 46 billion or 135 compared to 2004 this increase was primarily due to higher revenue from sales of mobile microprocessors and higher chipset revenue fiscal year 2005 was a 53week fiscal year in contrast to fiscal year 2004 which was a 52week fiscal year 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

in 2005 the asiapacific region’s revenue was approximately 50 of our total revenue and it was our fastest growing region increasing 26 compared to 2004 and reflecting the movement of more of our customers’ pc supply chains to asia this movement in the supply chain negatively affected our sales in the americas region which decreased 5 compared to 2004 japan revenue increased 19 and europe revenue increased 6 during 2005 compared to 2004 we saw growth in both mature and emerging markets in 2005 compared to 2004 

 

overall gross margin dollars for 2005 were 230 billion an increase of 33 billion or 17 compared to 2004 our overall gross margin percentage increased to 594 in 2005 from 577 in 2004 the overall gross margin percentage was positively affected by a mix shift of our total revenue to the mobility group which has a higher gross margin percentage the gross margin percentages for the digital enterprise group and flash memory group were higher and the gross margin percentage for the mobility group was lower in 2005 compared to 2004 a substantial majority of our overall gross margin dollars in 2005 and 2004 was derived from the sale of microprocessors as a result of a litigation settlement agreement with microunity we recorded a 140 million charge to cost of sales in 2005 of which 110 million was allocated to the digital enterprise group and 30 million was allocated to the mobility group the 2004 gross margin was affected by a litigation settlement with intergraph corporation in which we recorded a 162 million charge to cost of sales of which 120 million was allocated to the digital enterprise group and 42 million was allocated to the mobility group 

 

digital enterprise group 

 

the revenue and operating income for the digital enterprise group deg for the three years ended december 30 2006 were as follows 

 

 

 

net revenue for the deg operating segment decreased significantly by 53 billion or 21 in 2006 compared to 2005 the decline in net revenue was mostly due to a significant decline in microprocessor revenue and to a lesser extent a decline in chipset motherboard and other revenue the significant decline in microprocessor revenue was due to lower average selling prices and unit sales of desktop microprocessors enterprise microprocessor revenue increased in 2006 the decline in chipset motherboard and other revenue was due equally to lower chipset revenue and motherboard revenue microprocessors within deg include microprocessors designed for the desktop and enterprise computing market segments previously included within the former intel architecture business operating segment as well as embedded microprocessors revenue from network processors which are based on our intel xscale technology is included in “chipset motherboard and other revenue” above 

 

operating income decreased significantly by 48 billion or 53 in 2006 compared to 2005 substantially all of the decrease was due to the revenue decline higher microprocessor unit costs along with 210 million of higher factory underutilization charges were offset by approximately 540 million of lower startup costs unit costs were higher in 2006 compared to 2005 due primarily to a mix shift to dualcore microprocessors results for 2005 included a charge related to a settlement agreement with microunity 

 

for 2005 revenue for the deg operating segment was approximately flat compared to 2004 revenue from sales of microprocessors was approximately flat with slightly higher unit sales being offset by slightly lower average selling prices revenue from sales of server microprocessors in 2005 was negatively affected by the highly competitive server market chipset motherboard and other revenue was higher primarily due to higher average selling prices of chipsets 

 

operating income was also approximately flat at 90 billion in 2005 compared to 89 billion in 2004 the operating income for deg was positively affected by lower microprocessor unit costs and higher chipset revenue these improvements were offset by approximately 380 million of higher startup costs in 2005 primarily related to our 65nanometer process technology products based on our 65nanometer process technology began shipping in the fourth quarter of 2005 although revenue was flat operating expenses increased in 2005 which negatively affected operating income both periods were negatively affected by litigation settlement agreements results for 2005 included a charge related to a settlement agreement with microunity and results for 2004 included a charge related to a settlement agreement with intergraph 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

mobility group 

 

the revenue and operating income for the mobility group mg for the three years ended december 30 2006 were as follows 

 

 

 

net revenue for the mg operating segment increased by 12 billion or 11 in 2006 compared to 2005 microprocessor revenue increased by 508 million or 6 in 2006 compared to 2005 while chipsets and other revenue increased by 670 million or 28 in 2006 compared to 2005 the increase in microprocessor revenue was due to higher unit sales largely offset by lower average selling prices the majority of the increase in chipset and other revenue was due to higher revenue from sales of chipsets and to a lesser extent higher revenue from sales of wireless connectivity products sales of these products increased primarily due to the intel centrino duo mobile technology platform revenue from application and cellular baseband processors is included in “chipset and other revenue” above in the fourth quarter of 2006 we divested certain assets of the business line that included application and cellular baseband processors used in handheld devices see “note 14 acquisitions and divestitures” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

 

operating income decreased by 341 million or 6 in 2006 compared to 2005 the decline was primarily caused by higher operating expenses the effects of higher revenue were offset by higher unit costs for microprocessors startup costs were approximately 170 million lower in 2006 compared to 2005 

 

for 2005 revenue for the mg operating segment increased by 415 billion or 59 compared to 2004 this increase was primarily due to significantly higher revenue from sales of microprocessors which increased 30 billion or 54 in 2005 compared to 2004 reflecting the continued growth in the notebook market segment increased use of microprocessors designed specifically for mobile platforms in notebook computers also contributed to the higher revenue the higher revenue from sales of microprocessors was due to significantly higher unit sales partially offset by lower average selling prices primarily due to higher unit sales of the celeron m processor our value mobile processor revenue from sales of chipsets and wireless connectivity products also increased significantly in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to the success of intel centrino mobile technology 

 

operating income increased to 53 billion in 2005 from 28 billion in 2004 the significant increase in operating income was primarily due to higher revenue in addition operating expenses for the mg operating segment did not increase as fast as revenue and microprocessor unit costs were lower these increases in operating income were partially offset by approximately 170 million of higher startup costs in 2005 primarily related to our 65nanometer process technology 

 

flash memory group 

 

the revenue and operating loss for the flash memory group fmg for the three years ended december 30 2006 were as follows 

 

 

 

net revenue for the fmg operating segment decreased by 115 million or 5 in 2006 compared to 2005 this decrease was primarily due to lower average selling prices partially offset by higher royalty receipts in 2006 we began shipping nand flash memory products manufactured by imft operating loss increased to 555 million in 2006 from 154 million in 2005 the increase was primarily due to higher costs related to our new nand flash memory business lower revenue for our nor flash business was offset by lower unit costs and lower startup costs 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

for 2005 revenue for the fmg operating segment remained approximately flat at 23 billion compared to 2004 revenue was positively affected by higher unit sales and negatively affected by lower average selling prices operating loss remained approximately flat in 2005 at 154 million compared to 149 million in 2004 the operating loss was positively affected by lower unit costs and negatively affected by higher operating expenses 

 

sharebased compensation 

 

sharebased compensation totaled 14 billion in 2006 compared to zero in 2005 and 2004 we adopted sfas no 123r under the modified prospective transition method effective beginning in the first quarter of 2006 prior to adoption of sfas no 123r we accounted for our equity incentive plans under the intrinsic value recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board apb opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” apb no 25 and related interpretations accordingly no sharebased compensation other than insignificant amounts of acquisitionrelated sharebased compensation was recognized in net income 

 

as of december 30 2006 unrecognized sharebased compensation costs and the weighted average period over which the costs are expected to be recognized were as follows 

 

 

 

sharebased compensation charges are included in the “all other” category for segment reporting purposes 

 

operating expenses 

 

operating expenses for the three years ended december 30 2006 were as follows 

 

 

 

research and development research and development spending increased 728 million or 14 in 2006 compared to 2005 and increased 367 million or 8 in 2005 compared to 2004 the increase in 2006 compared to 2005 was primarily due to sharebased compensation of 487 million and to a lesser extent higher development costs driven by our nextgeneration 45nanometer manufacturing process technology lower profitdependent compensation expenses partially offset these increases the increase in 2005 compared to 2004 was primarily due to higher headcount and profitdependent compensation expenses partially offset by lower expenses related to development for our 65nanometer manufacturing process technology fiscal year 2005 included 53 weeks 

 

marketing general and administrative marketing general and administrative expenses increased 408 million or 7 in 2006 compared to 2005 and increased 10 billion or 22 in 2005 compared to 2004 the increase in 2006 compared to 2005 was primarily due to sharebased compensation of 539 million and to a lesser extent higher headcount partially offsetting these increases were lower marketing program spending and lower profitdependent compensation expenses the increase in 2005 compared to 2004 was primarily due to higher marketing program spending higher headcount and higher profitdependent compensation expenses as well as the extra work week 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

research and development along with marketing general and administrative expenses were 34 of net revenue in 2006 and 28 of net revenue in 2005 and 2004 

 

restructuring and asset impairment charges we are undertaking a restructuring plan designed to improve operational efficiency and financial results in the third quarter of 2006 management approved several actions related to this plan that were recommended by the company’s structure and efficiency task force a portion of these activities involves cost savings or other actions that do not result in restructuring charges such as better utilization of assets reduced spending and organizational efficiencies the efficiency program includes headcount targets for various groups within the company and we expect these targets to be met through ongoing employee attrition divestitures and employee terminations 

 

during 2006 we incurred 238 million of restructuring charges related to employee severance and benefit arrangements for approximately 4800 employees of which approximately 4100 employees had left the company as of december 30 2006 a substantial majority of these employee terminations occurred within marketing manufacturing information technology and human resources additionally we completed the divestiture of the assets of three businesses in 2006 concurrently with the ongoing execution of the efficiency program see “note 14 acquisitions and divestitures” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k for further details in connection with the divestiture of certain assets of the communications and application processor business we recorded impairment charges of 103 million related to the writedown of manufacturing tools to their fair value less the cost to dispose of the assets the fair value was determined using a marketbased valuation technique in addition as a result of both this divestiture and a subsequent assessment of our worldwide manufacturing capacity operations management placed for sale its fabrication facility in colorado springs colorado this plan resulted in an impairment charge of 214 million to write down to fair value the land building and equipment asset grouping that has been principally used to support the communications and application processor business the fair market value of the asset grouping was determined using various valuation techniques 

 

the following table summarizes the restructuring and asset impairment activity for 2006 

 

 

 

the restructuring and asset impairment charges above have been reflected separately as restructuring and asset impairment charges on the consolidated statements of income the restructuring accrual balance relates to severance benefits that are expected to be paid within the next 12 months as such the restructuring accrual is recorded as a current liability within accrued compensation and benefits on the consolidated balance sheets no restructuring charges were incurred in 2005 or 2004 we expect to record additional employee severance and benefit charges of approximately 50 million in the first quarter of 2007 in addition we may incur charges in the future under this restructuring for facilityrelated or other exit activities 

 

we estimate that the currentyear employee severance and benefit charges will result in gross annual savings of approximately 600 million we expect these savings to be realized in approximately equal amounts within cost of sales research and development and marketing general and administrative expenses see “note 11 restructuring and asset impairment charges” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k see also the risks described in “risk factors” in part i item 1a of this form 10k 

 

amortization of acquisitionrelated intangibles and costs amortization of acquisitionrelated intangibles and costs was 42 million in 2006 126 million in 2005 and 179 million in 2004 the decreased amortization each year compared to the previous year was primarily due to a portion of the intangibles related to prior acquisitions becoming fully amortized

gains losses on equity securities interest and other and provision for taxes 

 

gains losses on equity securities net interest and other net and provision for taxes for the three years ended december 30 2006 were as follows 

 

 

 

during 2006 the gains on equity securities of 293 million included the gain of 103 million on the sale of a portion of our investment in micron which was sold for 275 million during 2005 impairment charges of 208 million included a 105 million impairment charge on our investment in micron the impairment was principally based on our assessment during the second quarter of 2005 of micron’s financial results and the fact that the market price of micron’s stock had been below our cost basis for an extended period of time as well as the competitive pricing environment for dram products during 2004 the net losses on equity securities of 2 million included impairments of 117 million primarily on nonmarketable equity securities 

 

interest and other net increased to 12 billion in 2006 compared to 565 million in 2005 reflecting net gains of 612 million for three completed divestitures see “note 14 acquisitions and divestitures” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k and higher interest income as a result of higher interest rates partially offset by lower cash balances interest and other net increased to 565 million in 2005 compared to 289 million in 2004 reflecting higher interest income as a result of higher interest rates interest and other net for 2004 also included approximately 60 million of gains associated with terminating financing arrangements for manufacturing facilities and equipment in ireland 

 

our effective income tax rate was 286 in 2006 313 in 2005 and 278 in 2004 the rate decreased in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to a higher percentage of our profits being derived from lower tax jurisdictions in addition the rate for 2005 included an increase to the tax provision of approximately 265 million as a result of the decision to repatriate nonus earnings under the american jobs creation act of 2004 partially offsetting the decrease in the effective tax rate was the impact of sharebased compensation the phasing out of the tax benefit for export sales only slightly increased the effective tax rate compared to the prior year given the decrease in income before taxes our effective income tax rate was higher in 2005 compared to 2004 due to the decision to repatriate nonus earnings which were partially offset by the reversal of previously accrued items the tax rate for 2004 included a 195 million reduction to the tax provision primarily from additional benefits for export sales along with state tax benefits for divestitures as well as the reversal of previously accrued taxes primarily related to the closing of a state income tax audit 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

our financial condition remains strong cash shortterm investments fixed income debt instruments included in trading assets and debt at the end of each period were as follows 

 

 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

in summary our cash flows were as follows 

 

 

 

operating activities 

 

cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain noncash items and changes in assets and liabilities for 2006 compared to 2005 the largest contributing factors to the decrease in cash provided by operating activities were due to lower net income lower net maturities of trading assets and changes in the amount of estimated tax payments partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable balances fiscal year 2006 included sharebased compensation charges of approximately 14 billion for 2005 compared to 2004 the majority of the increase in cash provided by operating activities was from higher net maturities of trading assets and higher net income partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable balances 

 

inventories as of december 30 2006 increased compared to december 31 2005 as we continued to ramp new higher cost products primarily related to microprocessors on our 65nanometer process technology and associated chipsets on our 90nanometer process technology accounts receivable as of december 30 2006 decreased compared to december 31 2005 primarily driven by lower revenue and higher cash collections for 2006 and 2005 our two largest customers accounted for 35 of net revenue with one of these customers accounting for 19 of revenue and another customer accounting for 16 additionally these two largest customers accounted for 52 of net accounts receivable at december 30 2006 42 at december 31 2005 

 

investing activities 

 

investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures and payments for investments acquired partially offset by proceeds from investment maturities and sales the decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2006 compared to 2005 was primarily due to higher net maturities and sales of availableforsale investments we also received 752 million for the sale of three completed divestitures see “note 14 acquisitions and divestitures” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k additionally during 2006 we sold a portion of our investment in micron for 275 million partially offsetting these impacts we paid 600 million in cash for our equity investment in clearwire and 615 million in cash for our equity investment in imft in addition to the 615 million paid in cash our initial investment in imft of 12 billion included the issuance of 581 million in notes reflected as a financing activity in addition we made a capital contribution of 128 million to imft other investing activities for 2006 included the purchase of intellectual property assets from micron concurrent with the formation of imft for 230 million for 2005 compared to 2004 the higher cash used in investing activities resulted from capital spending primarily driven by investments in 65nanometer production equipment 

 

financing activities 

 

financing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases and retirement of common stock and payment of dividends to stockholders the lower cash used in financing activities in 2006 compared to 2005 was primarily due to a decrease in repurchases and retirement of common stock partially offset by additions to longterm debt in 2005 of 17 billion for 2006 we repurchased 226 million shares of common stock for 46 billion compared to 418 million shares for 106 billion in 2005 at december 30 2006 173 billion remained available for repurchase under existing repurchase authorizations our dividend payments were 23 billion in 2006 which is higher than the 20 billion paid in 2005 due to an increase from 008 to 010 in cash dividends per common share effective for the first quarter of 2006 on january 18 2007 our board of directors declared a cash dividend of 01125 per common share effective the first quarter of 2007 additional financing activities for 2006 included proceeds from the sale of shares pursuant to employee equity incentive plans of 10 billion 12 billion during 2005 for 2005 compared to 2004 the higher cash used in financing activities was primarily due to an increase in repurchases and retirements of common stock partially offset by cash received from the issuance of longterm debt 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

 

liquidity 

 

during 2006 our level of cash declined as our cash provided by operations was less than our cash used for investing and financing activities cash generated by operations is used as our primary source of liquidity another potential source of liquidity is authorized borrowings including commercial paper of 30 billion there were no borrowings under our commercial paper program during 2006 we also have an automatic shelf registration on file with the sec pursuant to which we may offer an indeterminate amount of debt equity and other securities 

 

we believe that we have the financial resources needed to meet business requirements for the next 12 months including capital expenditures for the expansion or upgrading of worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test capacity working capital requirements the dividend program potential stock repurchases potential future acquisitions or strategic investments and cash payments associated with our structure and efficiency program 

 

contractual obligations 

 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at december 30 2006 

 

 

 

  

contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services generally include agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on intel and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction the table above also includes agreements to purchase raw materials that have cancellation provisions requiring little or no payment the amounts under such contracts are included in the table above because management believes that cancellation of these contracts is unlikely and expects to make future cash payments according to the contract terms or in similar amounts for similar materials for other obligations with cancellation provisions the amounts included in the table above were limited to the noncancelable portion of the agreement terms andor the minimum cancellation fee 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

we have entered into certain agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods that specify minimum prices and quantities that are based on a percentage of the total available market or based on a percentage of our future purchasing requirements due to the uncertainty of the future market and our future purchasing requirements obligations under these agreements are not included in the table above we estimate our obligation under these agreements as of december 30 2006 to be approximately as follows less than one year—175 million one to three years—600 million three to five years—400 million more than five years—zero our purchase orders for other products are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons in addition some of our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 

 

contractual obligations that are contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones are not included in the table above these obligations include milestonebased comarketing agreements contingent funding obligations and milestonebased equity investment funding these arrangements are not considered contractual obligations until the milestone is met by the third party as of december 30 2006 assuming that all future milestones are met additional required payments would be approximately 254 million 

 

for the majority of restricted stock units granted the number of shares issued on the date the restricted stock units vest is net of the statutory withholding requirements that are paid by intel on behalf of its employees the obligation to pay the relative taxing authority is not included in the table above as the amount is contingent upon continued employment in addition the amount of the obligation is unknown as it is based in part on the market price of our common stock when the awards vest 

 

the expected timing of payments of the obligations above are estimates based on current information timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations amounts disclosed as contingent or milestonebased obligations are dependent on the achievement of the milestones or the occurrence of the contingent events and can vary significantly 

 

we currently have a contractual obligation to purchase the output of imft in proportion to our investment in imft which is currently 49 see “note 17 venture” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k additionally we have entered into various contractual commitments in relation to our investment in imft some of these commitments are with micron and some are directly with imft the following are the significant contractual commitments 

  

offbalancesheet arrangements 

 

as of december 30 2006 we did not have any significant offbalancesheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk 

 

employee equity incentive plans 

 

our equity incentive programs are broadbased longterm retention programs that are intended to attract and retain talented employees and align stockholder and employee interests in may 2006 stockholders approved the 2006 equity incentive plan the 2006 plan the 2006 plan replaced the 2004 equity incentive plan which was terminated early under the 2006 plan 175 million shares of common stock were made available for issuance as equity awards to employees and nonemployee directors through june 2008 of which a maximum of 80 million shares can be awarded as restricted stock or restricted stock units additionally in may 2006 stockholders approved the 2006 stock purchase plan under the 2006 stock purchase plan 240 million shares of common stock were made available for issuance through august 2011 the 1976 stock participation plan and all remaining shares available for issuance thereunder were cancelled as of the plan’s expiration in august 2006 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

our goal has been to keep the potential incremental dilution related to our equity incentive plans to a longterm average of less than 2 annually the dilution percentage is calculated using the equitybased awards granted during the period net of awards cancelled due to employees leaving the company and expired stock options divided by the total outstanding shares at the beginning of the year for purposes of this disclosure equitybased awards include stock option grants and restricted stock unit grants but exclude rights granted under the stock purchase plan and awards assumed in connection with acquisitions 

 

equitybased awards granted to employees including officers and nonemployee directors from 2002 through 2006 are summarized as follows 

 

 

 

  

in accordance with a policy established by the compensation committee of the board of directors total equitybased awards granted to the listed officers may not exceed 5 of total equitybased awards granted in any year during 2006 equitybased awards granted to listed officers amounted to 16 of the grants made to all employees all equitybased awards to executive officers are determined by the compensation committee all members of the compensation committee are independent directors as defined in the applicable rules for issuers traded on the nasdaq global select market 

 

for additional information regarding equity incentive plans and the activity for the past three years see “note 3 employee equity incentive plans” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k information regarding our equity incentive plans should be read in conjunction with the information appearing under the heading “compensation discussion and analysis” and “proposal 3 approval of amendment and extension of the 2006 equity incentive plan” in our 2007 proxy statement which is incorporated by reference into this form 10k 

 

business outlook 

 

our future results of operations and the other forwardlooking statements contained in this form 10k including this mda involve a number of risks and uncertainties—in particular the statements regarding our goals and strategies new product introductions plans to cultivate new businesses future economic conditions revenue pricing gross margin and costs capital spending depreciation and amortization research and development expenses potential impairment of investments the tax rate and pending tax and legal proceedings our future results of operations may also be affected by the amount type and valuation of the sharebased awards granted as well as the amount of awards cancelled due to employees leaving the company and the timing of award exercises by employees we are in the midst of a structure and efficiency program which may result in several actions that could have an impact on expense levels and gross margin in addition to the various important factors discussed above a number of other important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations see the risks described in “risk factors” in part i item 1a of this form 10k 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

our financial results are substantially dependent on sales of microprocessors revenue is partly a function of the mix of types and performance capabilities of microprocessors sold as well as the mix of chipsets flash memory and other semiconductor products sold all of which are difficult to forecast because of the wide price differences among mobile desktop and server microprocessors the mix of types and performance levels of microprocessors sold affects the average selling price that we will realize and has a large impact on our revenue and gross margin revenue is affected by the timing of new intel product introductions and the demand for and market acceptance of our products as well as actions taken by our competitors including new product offerings marketing programs and pricing pressures and our reaction to such actions microprocessor revenue is also dependent on the availability of other parts of the platform including chipsets motherboards operating system software and application software revenue is also subject to demand fluctuations and the impact of economic conditions in various geographic regions 

 

our gross margin expectation for 2007 is 50 plus or minus a few points the 50 midpoint is slightly lower compared to our 2006 gross margin of 515 primarily due to expected higher startup costs for microprocessors and chipsets partially offset by lower unit costs on microprocessors the gross margin percentage could vary significantly from expectations based on changes in revenue levels product mix and pricing capacity utilization changes in unit costs excess or obsolete inventory manufacturing yields the timing and execution of the manufacturing ramp and associated costs including startup costs and impairments of longlived assets including manufacturing assembly and test and intangible assets 

 

we have continued to expand our semiconductor manufacturing and assembly and test capacity over the last few years and we continue to plan capacity based on our overall strategy and the acceptance of our products in specific market segments we currently expect that capital spending in 2007 will be approximately 55 billion plus or minus 200 million compared to 58 billion in 2006 capital spending is expected to be lower in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to continued efficiency efforts partially offset by higher spending on capital equipment related to our nextgeneration 45nanometer process technology this capitalspending plan is dependent on expectations regarding production efficiencies and delivery times of various machinery and equipment and construction schedules if the demand for our products does not grow and continue to move toward higher performance products in the various market segments revenue and gross margin would be adversely affected manufacturing andor assembly and test capacity would be underutilized and the rate of capital spending could be reduced we could be required to record an impairment of our manufacturing or assembly and test equipment andor facilities or factory planning decisions may cause us to record accelerated depreciation in addition if demand for our products is reduced or we fail to accurately forecast demand we could be required to write down inventory which would have a negative impact on our gross margin however in the long term revenue and gross margin may also be affected if we do not add capacity fast enough to meet market demand 

 

depreciation for 2007 is expected to be approximately 48 billion plus or minus 100 million compared to 47 billion in 2006 

 

spending on research and development plus marketing general and administrative expenses total spending in 2007 is expected to be approximately 107 billion the expectation for total spending in 2007 is significantly lower than our 2006 spending of 120 billion we continue to focus on controlling our total spending through costsaving actions expenses particularly certain marketing and compensation expenses vary depending on the level of demand for our products the level of revenue and profits and impairments of longlived assets research and development spending in 2007 is expected to be approximately 54 billion 

 

the tax rate for 2007 is expected to be approximately 30 the estimated effective tax rate is based on tax law in effect at december 30 2006 and current expected income the tax rate may also be affected by the closing of acquisitions or divestitures the jurisdiction in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed changes in estimates of credits benefits and deductions the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities and the ability to realize deferred tax assets 

 

we believe that we have the product offerings facilities personnel and competitive and financial resources for continued business success but future revenue costs gross margin and profits are all influenced by a number of factors including those discussed above all of which are inherently difficult to forecast 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued 

status of business outlook 

 

we expect that our corporate representatives will from time to time meet privately with investors investment analysts the media and others and may reiterate the forwardlooking statements contained in the “business outlook” section and elsewhere in this form 10k including any such statements that are incorporated by reference in this form 10k at the same time we will keep this form 10k and our most current business outlook publicly available on our investor relations web site at wwwintccom  the public can continue to rely on the business outlook published on the web site as representing our current expectations on matters covered unless we publish a notice stating otherwise the statements in the “business outlook” and other forwardlooking statements in this form 10k are subject to revision during the course of the year in our quarterly earnings releases and sec filings and at other times 

 

from the close of business on march 2 2007 until our quarterly earnings release is published presently scheduled for april 17 2007 we will observe a “quiet period” during the quiet period the “business outlook” and other forwardlooking statements first published in our form 8k filed on january 16 2007 as reiterated or updated as applicable in this form 10k should be considered historical speaking as of prior to the quiet period only and not subject to update during the quiet period our representatives will not comment on the business outlook or our financial results or expectations the exact timing and duration of the routine quiet period and any others that we utilize from time to time may vary at our discretion 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in currency exchange rates interest rates and marketable equity security prices we use derivative financial instruments primarily to mitigate these risks and as part of our strategic investment program all of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial positions at december 30 2006 and december 31 2005 actual results may differ materially 

 

currency exchange rates 

 

we generally hedge currency risks of nonusdollardenominated investments in debt securities with offsetting currency borrowings currency forward contracts or currency interest rate swaps gains and losses on these nonuscurrency investments would generally be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments resulting in negligible net exposure 

 

a substantial majority of our revenue expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars however we do incur certain operating costs in other currencies to protect against reductions in value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates we have established balance sheet and forecasted transaction risk management programs currency forward contracts and currency options are generally utilized in these hedging programs our hedging programs reduce but do not always entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements we considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates of 20 for all currencies could be experienced in the near term such adverse changes after taking into account hedges and offsetting positions would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before taxes of less than 30 million at the end of 2006 and 2005 

 

interest rates 

 

the primary objective of our investments in debt securities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields to achieve this objective the returns on our investments in fixedrate debt are generally based on the threemonth libor or if longer term are generally swapped into us dollar threemonth liborbased returns in addition to fixedrate debt investments in 2005 we issued debt see “note 6 borrowings” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k for additional information we considered the historical volatility of the interest rates experienced in prior years and the duration of our investment portfolio and debt issuances and determined that it was reasonably possible that an adverse change of 80 basis points 080 approximately 15 of the rate at december 30 2006 18 of the rate at december 31 2005 could be experienced in the near term a hypothetical 080 decrease in interest rates after taking into account hedges and offsetting positions would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our net investment position of approximately 50 million as of december 30 2006 and 10 million as of december 31 2005 the increase in exposure to an adverse fair value change from december 31 2005 to december 30 2006 was primarily driven by a decrease in the price of our common stock which increased the sensitivity of the fair value of our convertible debt to adverse changes in interest rates 

 

equity security prices 

 

we have a portfolio of strategic equity investments that includes marketable strategic equity securities and derivative equity instruments such as warrants and options as well as nonmarketable equity investments we invest in companies that develop software hardware or services supporting our technologies our current investment focus areas include helping to enable mobile wireless devices advance the digital home provide access to premium digital content enhance the digital enterprise advance highperformance communications infrastructures and develop the next generation of silicon production technologies our focus areas tend to develop and change over time due to rapid advancements in technology 

 

our total marketable portfolio includes marketable strategic equity securities as well as marketable equity securities classified as trading assets to the extent that our marketable portfolio of investments continues to have strategic value we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposure for securities that we no longer consider strategic we evaluate legal market and economic factors in our decision on the timing of disposal and whether it is possible and appropriate to hedge the equity market risk we may or may not enter into transactions to reduce or eliminate the market risks of our investments in strategic equity derivatives including warrants 

 

the marketable equity securities included in trading assets as well as certain equity derivatives are held to generate returns that generally offset changes in liabilities related to the equity market risk of certain deferred compensation arrangements the gains and losses from changes in fair value of these equity securities are generally offset by the gains and losses on the related liabilities resulting in a net exposure of less than 10 million as of both december 30 2006 and december 31 2005 assuming a reasonably possible decline in market prices of approximately 10 in the near term 

as of december 30 2006 the fair value of our portfolio of marketable strategic equity investments and equity derivative instruments including hedging positions was 427 million 574 million as of december 31 2005 to assess the market price sensitivity of these equity securities we analyzed the historical movements over the past several years of hightechnology stock indices that we considered appropriate however our marketable strategic equity portfolio is substantially concentrated in one company as of december 30 2006 which will affect the portfolio’s price volatility we currently have an investment in micron with a fair value of 236 million at december 30 2006 or 55 of the total marketable strategic equity portfolio value including equity derivative instruments during 2006 we sold a portion of our investment in micron based on the analysis of the hightechnology stock indices and the historical volatility of micron’s stock we estimated that it was reasonably possible that the prices of the stocks in our marketable strategic equity portfolio could experience a loss of 30 in the near term 40 as of december 31 2005 this estimate is not necessarily indicative of future performance and actual results may differ materially 

 

assuming a loss of 30 in market prices and after reflecting the impact of hedges and offsetting positions our marketable strategic equity portfolio could decrease in value by approximately 134 million based on the value of the portfolio as of december 30 2006 a decrease in value of approximately 245 million based on the value of the portfolio as of december 31 2005 using an assumed loss of 40 

 

our strategic investments in nonmarketable equity securities are affected by many of the same factors that could result in an adverse movement of equity market prices although the impact cannot be directly quantified such a movement and the underlying economic conditions would negatively affect the prospects of the companies we invest in their ability to raise additional capital and the likelihood of our being able to realize our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings mergers or private sales these types of investments involve a great deal of risk and there can be no assurance that any specific company will grow or become successful consequently we could lose all or part of our investment at december 30 2006 our strategic investments in nonmarketable equity securities had a carrying amount of 28 billion 561 million as of december 31 2005 the carrying amount of these investments approximated fair value as of december 30 2006 and december 31 2005 as of december 30 2006 our nonmarketable equity securities portfolio was concentrated in two companies imft and clearwire imft is a manufacturer of nand flash memory with a carrying amount of 13 billion or 46 of the total value of the nonmarketable equity securities portfolio at december 30 2006 see “note 17 venture” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k the terms of our investment in imft contain contractual conditions that restrict our ability to sell the investment clearwire builds and operates nextgeneration wireless broadband networks our investment has a carrying amount of 613 million or 22 of the total value of the nonmarketable equity securities portfolio at december 30 2006 see “note 7 investments” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k

our products include microprocessors chipsets motherboards flash memory wired and wireless connectivity products communications infrastructure components including network processors application and cellular baseband processors and products for networked storage 

our customers include 

 we believe that the end users of computing and communications systems and devices want products based on platform solutions we define a platform as a collection of technologies that are designed to work together to provide a better enduser solution than if the ingredients were used separately our platforms consist of standards and initiatives such as wifi and wimax hardware and software that may include technologies such as hyperthreading technology ht technology intel ® virtualization technology and intel ® active management technology intel ® amt and services in developing our platforms we may include ingredients sold by other companies we also believe that users of computing and communications systems and devices want improved overall performance andor improved performance per watt improved overall performance can include faster processing performance andor other improved capabilities such as multithreading andor multitasking connectivity security manageability reliability ease of use andor interoperability among devices improved performance per watt involves balancing the addition of these types of improved performance capabilities in relation to the power consumption of the platform lower power consumption may reduce system heat output provide power savings and reduce the total cost of ownership for the end user 

1 a microprocessor is the central processing unit cpu of a computer system it processes system data and controls other devices in the system acting as the “brains” of the computer one indicator of a microprocessor’s performance is its clock speed the rate at which its internal logic operates which is measured in units of hertz or cycles processed per second one megahertz mhz equals one million cycles processed per second and one gigahertz ghz equals one billion cycles processed per second as computers continue to support more usage models other factors are increasingly important to overall platform performance for example microprocessors have historically contained only one processor core recently we have started offering dualcore microprocessors such as the intel ® core tm duo processor and the intel pentium ® d processor which contain two processor cores and deliver more capabilities in the form of higher system throughput and simultaneous management of activities while balancing power requirements other examples of factors that are increasingly important to overall platform performance include the amount and type of memory storage the speed of memory access the microarchitecture design of the cpu and the speed of communication between the cpu and the chipset a faster bus for example allows for faster data transfer into and out of the processor enabling increased performance a bus carries data between parts of the system a common way to categorize microprocessor design architectures is by the number of bits the smallest unit of information on a machine that the processor can handle at one time microprocessors currently are designed to process 32 bits or 64 bits of information at one time microprocessors with 64bit processing capability can address significantly more memory than 32bit microprocessors the intel ® core tm  intel ® pentium ®  intel ® celeron ® and intel ® xeon ® branded products are based on our 32bit architecture ia32 while intel ® itanium ® branded products are based on our 64bit architecture another way to provide 64bit processing capability is for processors based on 32bit architecture to have 64bit address extensions recent product introductions from our pentium celeron and intel xeon product families are typically equipped with intel ® extended memory 64 technology intel ® em64t which provides 64bit address extensions supporting both 32bit and 64bit software applications the memory storage on a chip is measured in bytes 8 bits with 1024 bytes equaling a kilobyte kb 1049 million bytes equaling a megabyte mb and 1074 billion bytes equaling a gigabyte gb cache is a memory that can be located directly on the microprocessor permitting quicker access to frequently used data and instructions some of our microprocessors have additional levels of cache secondlevel l2 cache and thirdlevel l3 cache to offer higher levels of performance 

other microprocessor capabilities can also enhance system performance or user experience by running software more efficiently for example we offer microprocessors with intel’s ht technology which allows each processor core to process two threads of instructions simultaneously this capability can provide benefits in one of two ways it helps to run “multithreaded” software which is designed to execute different parts of a program simultaneously or it helps to run multiple software programs simultaneously in a multitasking environment other technologies include intel amt which allows information technology managers to diagnose fix and protect enabled systems that are plugged in and connected to a network even if a computer is turned off or has a failed hard drive or operating system and intel virtualization technology which enables increased utilization of servers and establishes a management partition that provides increased security and management capabilities to take advantage of these technologies a computer system must have a microprocessor that supports the technology a chipset and bios basic inputoutput system that use the technology and software that is optimized for the technology performance also will vary depending on the system hardware and software used 

our microprocessor sales generally have followed a seasonal trend however there can be no assurance that this trend will continue historically our sales of microprocessors have been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year consumer purchases of pcs have been higher in the second half of the year primarily due to backto school and holiday demand in addition technology purchases from businesses have tended to be higher in the second half of the year 

the chipset operates as the pc’s “nervous system” sending data between the microprocessor and input display and storage devices such as the keyboard mouse monitor hard drive and cd or dvd drive chipsets perform essential logic functions such as balancing the performance of the system and removing bottlenecks chipsets also extend the graphics audio video and other capabilities of many systems based on our microprocessors finally chipsets control the access between the cpu and main memory we offer chipsets compatible with a variety of industryaccepted bus specifications such as the accelerated graphics port agp specification the peripheral components interconnect pci local bus specification and the pci express local bus specification pci express significantly increases the data transfer rate of the original pci specification thereby improving the graphics and inputoutput bandwidth and enabling an improved multimedia experience our customers also want memory architecture alternatives and as a result we offer chipsets supporting double data rate ddr and ddr2 secondgeneration faster ddr memory dynamic random access memory dram and synchronous dram sdram 

a motherboard is the principal board within a system a motherboard has connectors for attaching devices to the bus and typically contains the cpu memory and the chipset we offer motherboard products designed for our microprocessors and chipsets thereby providing a more complete range of solutions for our customers looking for intel ® architecturebased solutions boardlevel products give our oem customers flexibility by enabling them to buy at the board level rather than only at the component level 

2 flash memory is a specialized type of memory component used to store user data and program code it retains this information even when the power is off and provides faster access to data than traditional hard drives flash memory has no moving parts unlike data that is stored on devices such as rapidly spinning hard drives allowing flash memory to be more tolerant of bumps and shocks a common measure of flash performance is the density of the product density refers to the amount of information the product is capable of storing flash memory is based on either nor or nand architectures nor flash memory with its fast “read” capabilities has traditionally been used to store executable code we offer nor flash memory products for advanced mobile phone designs our nor flash memory is also used in the embedded market segment and is found in various applications including settop boxes networking products and other devices including dvd players and dsl and cable modems nand flash memory is slower in reading data but faster in writing data and has traditionally been used in products that either required large storage capacity or fast write applications such as digital audio players including mp3 players as well as memory cards and digital cameras we began selling nand flash memory products in february 2006 our nand flash memory products are manufactured by im flash technologies llc imft a company we formed with micron technology inc in january 2006 for further discussion of our equity investment in imft see “note 16 venture” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k

manufacturing and assembly and test 

as of yearend 2005 77 of our wafer manufacturing including microprocessor chipset nor flash memory and communications silicon fabrication was conducted within the us at our facilities in new mexico oregon arizona massachusetts colorado and california outside the us nearly 23 of our wafer manufacturing including wafer fabrication for microprocessors chipsets nor flash memory and networking silicon was conducted at our facilities in ireland and israel 

as of december 2005 we primarily manufactured our products in the wafer fabrication facilities described in the following table 

 we expect to increase the capacity of certain facilities listed above through additional investments in capital equipment in addition to our current facilities we are building facilities in arizona and israel that are expected to begin wafer fabrication for microprocessors on 300mm wafers using 45nanometer technology after 2006 

8 as of yearend 2005 the majority of our microprocessors were manufactured on 300mm wafers using our 90nanometer process technology in 2005 we began manufacturing microprocessors on our 65nanometer process technology the next generation beyond our 90nanometer process technology as we move to each succeeding generation of manufacturing process technology we incur significant startup costs to get each factory ready for highvolume manufacturing however continuing to advance our process technology provides added benefits that we believe justify these costs these benefits can include utilizing less space per transistor which enables us to put more transistors on an equivalent size chip decreasing the size of the chip or allowing us to offer an increased number of integrated features these advancements can result in higher performing microprocessors products that consume less power andor products that cost less to manufacture to augment capacity in the us and internationally we use thirdparty manufacturing companies foundries to manufacture wafers for certain components including networking and communications products 

in january 2006 we formed imft a nand flash memory manufacturing company with micron imft manufactures for intel and micron and we currently purchase 49 of the manufactured output see “note 16 venture” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

we primarily use subcontractors to manufacture boardlevel products and systems and purchase certain communications networking products from external vendors primarily in the asiapacific region we also manufacture microprocessor and networkingrelated boardlevel products primarily in malaysia 

following manufacture the majority of our components are subject to assembly in several types of packaging and to testing we perform a substantial majority of our components assembly and test at facilities in malaysia china the philippines and costa rica we plan to continue to invest in new assembly and test technologies and facilities to keep pace with our microprocessor chipset flash memory and communications technology improvements to augment capacity we use subcontractors to perform assembly of certain products primarily flash memory chipsets and networking and communications products assembly and test of nand flash memory products manufactured by imft in 2006 is performed by micron 

our performance expectations for business integrity ethics and environmental health and safety compliance are the same regardless of whether our supplier and subcontractor operations are based in the us or elsewhere our employment practices are consistent with and we expect our suppliers and subcontractors to abide by local country law in addition we impose a minimum employee age requirement regardless of local law 

we have thousands of suppliers including subcontractors providing our various materials and service needs we set expectations for supplier performance and reinforce those expectations with periodic assessments we communicate those expectations to our suppliers regularly and work with them to implement improvements when necessary we seek where possible to have several sources of supply for all of these materials and resources but we may rely on a single or limited number of suppliers or upon suppliers in a single country in those cases we develop and implement plans and actions to reduce the exposure that would result from a disruption in supply 

our products typically are produced at multiple intel facilities at various sites around the world or by subcontractors who have multiple facilities however some products are produced in only one intel or subcontractor facility and we seek to implement actions and plans to reduce the exposure that would result from a disruption at any such facility on a worldwide basis we regularly review our key infrastructure systems services and suppliers both internally and externally to seek to identify significant vulnerabilities as well as areas of potential business impact if a disruptive event were to occur once a vulnerability is identified we assess the risks and as we consider it to be appropriate we initiate actions intended to reduce the risks and their potential impact however there can be no assurance that we have identified all significant risks or that we can mitigate all identified risks with reasonable effort see “risk factors” in part i item 1a of this form 10k 

we maintain a program of insurance coverage for various types of property casualty and other risks we place our insurance coverage with various carriers in numerous jurisdictions the policies are subject to deductibles and exclusions that result in our retention of a level of risk on a selfinsurance basis the types and amounts of insurance obtained vary from time to time and from location to location depending on availability cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention our worldwide risk and insurance programs are regularly evaluated to seek to obtain the most favorable terms and conditions 

research and development 

we continue to be committed to investing in worldclass technology development particularly in the area of the design and manufacture of integrated circuits research and development rd expenditures in 2005 amounted to 51 billion 48 billion in fiscal 2004 and 44 billion in fiscal 2003 additionally we increased the number of our employees engaged in rd to approximately 29000 as of december 2005 compared to approximately 25000 as of december 2004 

9 our rd activities are directed toward developing the technology innovations that we believe will deliver the next generation of products and platforms which will in turn enable new form factors and new usage models for businesses and consumers we are focusing our rd efforts on advanced computing communications and wireless technologies by advancing our silicon manufacturing process technology delivering the next generation of microprocessors and supporting chipsets improving our platform initiatives and developing software solutions and tools to support our technologies these efforts will enable new levels of performance and address areas such as system manageability power management digital content protection andor communication capabilities in line with these efforts we are currently developing our nextgeneration microarchitecture for microprocessors that will improve performance while lowering power consumption and enhance other capabilities across multiple platforms future generations of our microprocessors will continue to feature two or more processor cores on a single chip dual and multicore processors complement our efforts to enable more capabilities and new usage models for users our leadership in silicon technology has enabled us to make “moore’s law” a reality moore’s law predicted that transistor density on integrated circuits would double every two years our leadership in silicon technology has also helped to expand moore’s law by bringing new capabilities into silicon and producing new products and platforms optimized for a wider variety of applications in 2005 we began manufacturing microprocessors on our most advanced 65nanometer process technology the next generation beyond our 90nanometer process technology our 45nanometer process technology is currently in development and we expect to begin manufacturing products using 45nanometer process technology in 2007 in the area of wireless communications our initiatives focus on delivering the technologies that will enable an advanced wireless platform including 80216 products wimax additionally we continue to invest in new packaging and testing processes as well as improving existing products and reducing manufacturing costs 

we have an agreement with micron for joint development of nand flash memory technologies costs incurred by intel and micron for process development are generally split evenly as the owner of the product designs intel assumes the cost for product development intel licenses certain product designs to micron on a royaltybearing basis 

we do not expect that all of our research and product development projects will result in products that are ultimately released for sale we may terminate research andor product development before completion or decide not to manufacture and sell a developed product for a variety of reasons for example we may decide that a product might not be sufficiently competitive in the relevant market segment or for technological or marketing reasons we may decide to offer a different product instead 

our rd model is based on a global organization that emphasizes a collaborative approach in identifying and developing new technologies leading standards initiatives and influencing regulatory policy to accelerate the adoption of new technologies our rd initiatives are performed by various business groups within the company and we align and prioritize these initiatives across these business groups we also work with a worldwide network of academic and industry researchers scientists and engineers in the computing and communications fields our network of technology professionals allows us as well as others in our industry to benefit from development initiatives in a variety of areas eventually leading to innovative technologies for users we believe that we are well positioned in the technology industry to help drive innovation foster collaboration and promote industry standards that will yield innovative and improved technologies for users 

we perform a substantial majority of our research and development of semiconductor components and other products in the us outside the us we have been increasing our product development and we have activities at various locations including israel china india russia and malaysia we also maintain rd facilities in the us focused on developing and improving manufacturing processes as well as facilities in the us malaysia and the philippines dedicated to improvements in assembly and test processes 

employees 

as of december 31 2005 we employed approximately 99900 people worldwide with more than 50 of these employees located in the us 

sales and marketing 

most of our products are sold or licensed through sales offices located near major concentrations of users throughout the americas asiapacific europe and japan our business relies on continued sales growth in both mature and emerging markets 

10 sales of our products are typically made via purchase orders that contain standard terms and conditions covering matters such as pricing payment terms and warranties as well as indemnities for issues specific to our products such as patent and copyright indemnities from time to time we may enter into additional agreements with customers covering for example changes from our standard terms and conditions new product development and marketing privatelabel branding and other matters most of our sales are made using electronic and webbased processes that allow the customer to review inventory availability and track the progress of specific goods under order pricing on particular products may vary based on volumes ordered and other factors 

we sell our products to oems and odms odms provide design andor manufacturing services to branded and unbranded privatelabel resellers we also sell our products to industrial and retail distributors in 2005 dell inc accounted for approximately 19 of our total sales and hewlettpackard company accounted for approximately 16 of our total sales no other customer accounted for more than 10 of our total revenue for information about revenue and operating profit by operating segments and revenue from unaffiliated customers by geographic regioncountry see “note 19 operating segment and geographic information” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in part ii item 7 of this form 10k 

typically distributors handle a wide variety of products including those that compete with our products and fill orders for many customers most of our sales to distributors are made under agreements allowing for price protection on unsold merchandise and a right of return on stipulated quantities of unsold merchandise we also utilize thirdparty sales representatives who generally do not offer directly competitive products but may carry complementary items manufactured by others sales representatives do not maintain a product inventory instead their customers place orders directly with us or through distributors 

our worldwide reseller sales channel consists of thousands of indirect customers who are systems builders and purchase intel microprocessors and other products from our distributors these systems builders receive various levels of technical and marketing services and support directly from intel we have a “boxed processor program” that allows distributors to sell intel microprocessors in small quantities to these systemsbuilder customers boxed processors are also made available in direct retail outlets 

the intel corporate and product brand identities were revamped in early 2006 to signal intel’s new business strategy to deliver customerfocused platform solutions the changes include a new intel logo tagline intel leap ahead tm  and signature sound our platform solutions brands which integrate processors with other innovative hardware and software include intel centrino mobile technology and intel viiv technology the itanium intel xeon intel core pentium and intel celeron trademarks make up our processor brands we promote brand awareness and generate demand through our own direct marketing as well as comarketing programs our direct marketing activities include television print and webbased advertising as well as press relations consumer and trade events and industry and consumer communications currently our direct marketing to the consumer focuses on digital home entertainment and building awareness and demand for new usage models and capabilities for businesses our marketing to large enterprises and small to midsize organizations focuses on delivery of products and technologies designed for performance per watt reliability manageability and security 

purchases by customers often allow them to participate in cooperative advertising and marketing programs such as the intel inside ® program through the intel inside program certain customers are licensed to place intel logos on computers containing our microprocessors and our other technology and to use our brands in marketing activities the program includes a market development component that accrues funds based on purchases and partially reimburses the oems for marketing activities for products featuring intel brands subject to the oems meeting defined criteria this program broadens the reach of our brands beyond the scope of our own direct advertising 

our products are typically shipped under terms that transfer title to the customer even in arrangements for which the recognition of revenue on the sale is deferred our standard terms and conditions of sale typically provide that payment is due at a later date generally 30 days after shipment delivery or the customer’s use of the product our credit department sets accounts receivable and shipping limits for individual customers for the purpose of controlling credit risk to intel arising from outstanding account balances we assess credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis and from this analysis we establish credit limits and determine whether we will seek to use one or more credit support devices such as obtaining some form of thirdparty guaranty or standby letter of credit or obtaining credit insurance for all or a portion of the account balance credit losses may still be incurred due to bankruptcy fraud or other failure of the customer to pay see “schedule ii—valuation and qualifying accounts” in part iv of this form 10k for information about our allowance for doubtful receivables 

11 backlog 

we do not believe that a backlog as of any particular date is indicative of future results our sales are made primarily pursuant to standard purchase orders for delivery of standard products we have some agreements that give a customer the right to purchase a specific number of products during a specified time period although these agreements do not generally obligate the customer to purchase any particular number of such products some of these agreements do contain billback clauses under these clauses customers who do not purchase the full volume agreed upon are liable for billback on previous shipments up to the price appropriate for the quantity actually purchased as a matter of industry practice billback clauses are difficult to enforce the quantities actually purchased by the customer as well as the shipment schedules are frequently revised during the agreement term to reflect changes in the customer’s needs in light of industry practice and our experience we do not believe that such agreements are meaningful for determining backlog amounts only a small portion of our order backlog is noncancelable and the dollar amount associated with the noncancelable portion is not significant 

competition 

our products compete primarily on the basis of performance features quality brand recognition price and availability our ability to compete depends on our ability to provide innovative products and worldwide support for our customers including providing enhanced performance per watt reduced heat output and integrated solutions in addition to our various computing networking and communications products we offer technology platform solutions that incorporate our various components which bring together a collection of technologies that we believe create a better enduser solution than if the ingredients were used separately 

the semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid advances in technology and new product introductions as unit volumes grow production experience is accumulated and costs decrease further competition develops and as a result prices decline the life cycle of our products is very short sometimes less than a year our ability to compete depends on our ability to improve our products and processes faster than our competitors anticipate changing customer requirements and develop and launch new products while reducing our costs when we believe it is appropriate we will take various steps including introducing new products and platform solutions discontinuing older products reducing prices and offering rebates and other incentives to increase acceptance of our latest products and to be competitive within each relevant market segment our products compete with products developed for similar or rival architectures and with products based on the same or rival technology standards we cannot predict which competing technology standards will become the prevailing standards in the market segments in which we compete 

many companies compete with us in the various computing networking and communications market segments and are engaged in the same basic fields of activity including research and development worldwide these competitors range in size from large established multinational companies with multiple product lines to smaller companies and new entrants to the marketplace that compete in specialized market segments in some cases our competitors are also our customers andor suppliers product offerings may cross over into multiple product categories offering us new opportunities but also resulting in more competitors in market segments where our competitors have established products and brand recognition it may be difficult for us to compete against them 

we believe that our network of manufacturing facilities and assembly and test facilities gives us a competitive advantage this network enables us to have more direct control over our processes quality control product cost volume and timing of production and other factors these types of facilities are very expensive and many of our competitors do not own such facilities because they cannot afford to do so or because their business models involve the use of thirdparty facilities for manufacturing and assembly and test these “fabless semiconductor companies” include broadcom corporation nvidia corporation qualcomm incorporated and via technologies inc via some of our competitors own portions of such facilities through investment or jointventure arrangements with other companies there is a group of thirdparty manufacturing companies foundries and assembly and test subcontractors that offer their services to companies without owned facilities or companies needing additional capacity these foundries and subcontractors may also offer to our competitors intellectual property design services and other goods and services competitors who outsource their manufacturing and assembly and test operations can significantly reduce their capital expenditures 

12 we plan to continue to cultivate new businesses and work with the computing and communications industries through standards bodies trade associations oems odms and independent software and operating system vendors to align the industry to offer products that take advantage of the latest market trends and usage models these efforts include helping to create the infrastructure for wireless network connectivity we are also working with these industries to develop software applications and operating systems that take advantage of our platforms we frequently participate in industry initiatives designed to discuss and agree upon technical specifications and other aspects of technologies that could be adopted as standards by standardssetting organizations in addition we work collaboratively with other companies to protect digital content and the consumer by developing content protection specifications such as the digital transmission content protection dtcp specification dtcp defines a secure protocol for protecting audio and video entertainment content from illegal copying intercepting and tampering as it moves across digital interfaces such as universal serial bus usb and ipbased home networks our competitors may also participate in the same initiatives and specification development and our participation does not ensure that any standards or specifications adopted by these organizations will be consistent with our product planning we continuously evaluate all of our product offerings and the timing of their introduction taking into account factors such as customer requirements and availability of infrastructure to take advantage of product performance and maturity of applications software for each type of product in the relevant market segments 

companies in the semiconductor industry often rely on the ability to license patents from each other in order to compete in today’s markets many of our competitors have broad crosslicenses or licenses with us and under current case law some such licenses may permit these competitors to pass our patent rights on to others if one of these licensees becomes a foundry our competitors might be able to avoid our patent rights in manufacturing competing products in addition to licensing our patents to competitors we participate in some industry organizations that are engaged in the development of standards or specifications and may require us to license our patents to other companies that adopt such industry standards or specifications even when such organizations do not adopt the standards or specifications proposed by intel any intel patents implicated by our participation in such initiatives might not in some situations be available for us to enforce against others who might be infringing those patents 

we continue to be largely dependent on the success of our microprocessor business many of our competitors including advanced micro devices inc amd our primary microprocessor competitor market softwarecompatible products that compete with intel architecturebased processors we also face competition from companies offering rival microprocessor designs such as international business machines corporation ibm which is jointly developing a rival architecture design with sony corporation and toshiba corporation our desktop processors compete with products offered by amd ibm and via among others our mobile microprocessor products compete with products offered by amd ibm transmeta corporation and via among others our server processors compete with softwarecompatible products offered by amd and with products based on rival architectures including those offered by ibm and sun microsystems inc 

our chipsets compete in the various market segments against different types of chipsets that support either our microprocessor products or rival microprocessor products competing chipsets are produced by companies such as ati technologies inc broadcom nvidia silicon integrated systems corporation sis and via we also compete with companies offering graphics components and other specialpurpose products used in the desktop mobile and server market segments one aspect of our business model is to incorporate improved performance and advanced properties into our microprocessors and chipsets the demand for which may increasingly be affected by competition from companies such as ati and nvidia whose business models are based on incorporating performance into dedicated chipsets and other components such as graphics controllers 

our nor flash memory products currently compete with the products of other companies such as samsung electronics co ltd spansion inc and stmicroelectronics nv the megabit demand of the products that make use of flash memory is increasing and our nor flash memory products face increased competition from companies that manufacture nand flash memory products as oems look for opportunities to use nand flash memory products with additional random access memory or in combination with nor flash memory for executablecode applications in january 2006 we formed imft a nand flash memory manufacturing company with micron that may provide us with more competitive opportunities with regard to nand flash memory products see “note 16 venture” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

we also offer products designed for wired and wireless connectivity for the communications infrastructure including network processors and for networked storage these products currently compete against offerings from companies such as applied micro circuits corporation amd broadcom freescale semiconductor inc ibm marvell technology group ltd nms communications corporation opnext inc and sun microsystems 

13 acquisitions and strategic investments 

during 2005 we completed three acquisitions qualifying as business combinations in exchange for aggregate net cash consideration of 177 million plus certain liabilities also during 2005 we acquired a developmentstage operation that resulted in the recording of workforcein place of 20 million an acquisition of a developmentstage operation does not qualify as a business combination during 2004 we completed one acquisition qualifying as a business combination in exchange for net cash consideration of approximately 33 million plus certain liabilities in addition we entered into certain arrangements in 2004 related to the hiring of a group of employees that resulted in the recording of an intangible asset for workforcein place of 28 million 

we make equity investments in companies around the world to further our strategic objectives and support our key business initiatives including investments through our intel capital program we generally focus on investing in companies and initiatives to stimulate growth in the digital economy create new business opportunities for intel and expand global markets for our products the investments may support among other things intel product initiatives emerging trends in the technology industry or worldwide internet deployment we invest in companies that develop software hardware or services supporting our technologies our current investment focus areas include helping to enable mobile wireless devices advance the digital home enhance the digital enterprise advance highperformance communications infrastructures and develop the next generation of silicon production technologies our focus areas tend to develop and change over time due to rapid advancements in technology many of our investments are in private companies including developmentstage companies with little or no revenue from current product offerings in january 2006 intel formed imft a nand flash memory manufacturing company with micron intel invested 12 billion in return for 49 of the equity of imft see “note 16 venture” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

intellectual property and licensing 

intellectual property rights that apply to our various products and services include patents copyrights trade secrets trademarks and maskwork rights we maintain an active program to protect our investment in technology by attempting to ensure respect for our intellectual property rights the extent of the legal protection given to different types of intellectual property rights varies under different countries’ legal systems we intend to license our intellectual property rights where we can obtain adequate consideration see “competition” in part i item 1 of this form 10k “legal proceedings” in part i item 3 of this form 10k and “risk factors” in part i item 1a of this form 10k 

we have filed and obtained a number of patents in the us and abroad while our patents are an important element of our success our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any one patent we and other companies in the computing telecommunications and related hightechnology fields typically apply for and receive in the aggregate tens of thousands of overlapping patents annually in the us and other countries we believe that the duration of the applicable patents we are granted is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products because of the fast pace of innovation and product development our products are often obsolete before the patents related to them expire and sometimes are obsolete before the patents related to them are even granted as we expand our product offerings into new industries such as consumer electronics we also seek to extend our patent development efforts to patent such product offerings established competitors in existing and new industries as well as companies that purchase and enforce patents and other intellectual property may already have patents covering similar products there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain patents covering our own products or that we will be able to obtain licenses from such companies on favorable terms or at all 

the large majority of the software we distribute including software embedded in our component and systemlevel products is entitled to copyright protection in most circumstances we require our customers to enter into a software license before we provide them with that software 

to distinguish intel products from our competitors’ products we have obtained certain trademarks and trade names for our products and we maintain cooperative advertising programs with certain customers to promote our brands and identify products containing genuine intel components 

we also protect certain details about our processes products and strategies as trade secrets keeping confidential the information that we believe provides us with a competitive advantage we have ongoing programs designed to maintain the confidentiality of such information 

14 compliance with environmental health and safety regulations 

intel is committed to achieving high standards of environmental quality and product safety and strives to provide a safe and healthy workplace for our employees our contractors and the communities in which we do business we have environmental health and safety ehs policies and expectations that are applied to our global operations each of intel’s worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test sites is registered to the international organization for standardization iso 14001 environmental management system standard which requires that a broad range of environmental management processes and policies be in place to continually improve environmental performance maintain compliance with environmental regulations and communicate effectively with interested stakeholders intel’s internal environmental auditing program includes not only compliance components but also modules on business risk environmental excellence and management systems we have internal processes that focus on minimizing and properly managing hazardous materials used in our facilities and products we monitor regulatory and resource trends and set companywide short and longterm performance targets for key resources and emissions these targets address several parameters including energy and water use climate change waste recycling and emissions intel remains on track to achieve our voluntary commitment to reduce emissions of certain global warming gases used in manufacturing by 10 from 1995 levels by 2010 due to intel’s increase in manufacturing since 1995 this will equate to an actual reduction in 2010 of more than 90 from what intel would have emitted without the voluntary reduction we also continue to take several actions to further our global energy reduction goal such as investing in energy conservation projects in our factories and working with suppliers of manufacturing tools to improve energy efficiency we expect that these actions will result in energy cost savings and improved efficiency in the use of electricity natural gas and water in addition we have adopted water needs and reuse strategies that align with local community expectations regardless of where we operate as such we continue to employ water use reduction strategies that seek to optimize the balance between ultrapure water needs and reuse options for industrial water 

as moore’s law drives increasing computing power year after year managing the power consumption of the pc becomes an increasing challenge intel has been a leader in developing innovative solutions to address and resolve power challenges to be successful intel has taken a holistic approach to power management addressing the challenge at all levels including the silicon package circuit micromacro architecture platform and software levels a few examples include novel transistor and chip designs such as strained silicon and sleep transistors enhanced intel speedstep ® technology for mobile and desktop platforms and demand based switching dbs technology for server platforms 

the manufacture and assembly and testing of intel products requires the use of hazardous materials that are subject to a broad array of ehs laws and regulations intel actively monitors the hazardous materials that are used in the manufacture and assembly and testing of our products particularly materials that end up in the final product intel has developed specific restrictions on the content of certain hazardous materials in our products as well as those of our suppliers and outsourced manufacturers and subcontractors intel’s efforts to reduce hazardous substances in our products has positioned us well to meet the various environmental restrictions on product content throughout the world such as the restriction on hazardous substances rohs directive in the european union eu the rohs directive eliminates most uses of lead cadmium hexavalentchromium mercury and certain fire retardants in electronics put on the market after july 1 2006 intel published its leadfree product roadmap in april 2004 and we already manufacture and ship many products that are rohs compliant eg flash memory products mobile desktop and server cpus chipsets network interface cards wireless cards and rohs compliant platforms intel’s roadmap is designed to enable all intel products sold into the eu to be rohs compliant before july 1 2006 the state of california also has adopted restrictions on the use of certain materials in electronic products that are intended to harmonize with the eu rohs directive those restrictions go into effect in 2007 other us states are considering similar legislation similarly china has promulgated use restrictions on the same substances as the eu rohs directive china has not yet defined either the scope of affected products or an effective date of the regulation intel is working with china’s ministry of information industry to promote consistency between china’s use restrictions and the eu rohs directive 

as intel continues to advance process technology the materials technologies and products themselves become increasingly complex our evaluations of new materials for use in rd manufacturing and assembly and test take into account ehs considerations and are a component of intel’s design for ehs processes compliance with these complex laws and regulations as well as internal voluntary programs is integrated into our manufacturing and assembly and test processes to our knowledge compliance with these laws and regulations has had no material effect on our operations 

intel is committed to the protection of human rights and the environment throughout its supply chain intel expects suppliers to understand and fully comply with all applicable international national state and local laws and regulations including but not limited to all ehs and related laws and regulations in addition suppliers are expected to abide by all intel rules maintain progressive employment practices and comply with all applicable laws including at a minimum those covering nondiscrimination in the terms and conditions of employment child labor minimum wages employee benefits and work hours

corporate governance is typically defined as the system that allocates duties and authority among a company’s stockholders board of directors and management the stockholders elect the board and vote on extraordinary matters the board is the company’s governing body responsible for hiring overseeing and evaluating management particularly the chief executive officer ceo and management runs the company’s dayto day operations the board believes that there should be a substantial majority of independent directors on the board the board also believes that it is useful and appropriate to have members of management including the ceo as directors 

the current board members include nine independent directors and two members of intel’s senior management the board members are craig r barrett intel’s chairman of the board ambassador charlene barshefsky senior international partner at the wilmer cutler pickering hale and dorr llp law firm e john p browne group chief executive of bp plc d james guzy chairman of arbor company reed e hundt principal charles ross partners llc paul s otellini intel’s chief executive officer and president james d plummer john m fluke professor of electrical engineering frederick e terman dean of the school of engineering stanford university david s pottruck chairman and chief executive officer of red eagle ventures inc and chairman of eos airlines jane e shaw retired chairman and chief executive officer of aerogen inc john l thornton professor and director of global leadership at tsinghua university beijing china and david b yoffie max and doris starr professor of international business administration harvard business school the board also has one director emeritus gordon e moore who may participate in board meetings but does not vote 

director changes in 2005 at the 2005 annual meeting andrew s grove retired from the board craig r barrett succeeded dr grove as chairman of the board and paul s otellini succeeded dr barrett as chief executive officer in july 2005 the board elected james d plummer to the board 

adoption of majority vote standard for election of directors on january 18 2006 the board approved an amendment to article iii section 1 of intel’s bylaws to require directors to be elected by a majority of the votes cast with respect to such director in uncontested elections number of shares voted “for” a director must exceed the number of votes cast against that director in a contested election a situation in which the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected the standard for election of directors will be a plurality of the shares represented in person or by proxy at any such meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors if a nominee who is serving as a director is not elected at the annual meeting under delaware law the director would continue to serve on the board as a “holdover director” however under our bylaws any director who fails to be elected must offer to tender his or her resignation to the board the corporate governance and nominating committee would then make a recommendation to the board whether to accept or reject the resignation or whether other action should be taken the board will act on the corporate governance and nominating committee’s recommendation and publicly disclose its decision and the rationale behind it within 90 days from the date the election results are certified the director who tenders his or her resignation will not participate in the board’s decision if a nominee who was not already serving as a director is not elected at the annual meeting under delaware law that nominee would not become a director and would not continue to serve on the board as a “holdover director” in 2006 all nominees for the election of directors are currently serving on the board

 item 1a risk factors 

fluctuations in demand for our products may adversely affect our financial results 

if demand for our products fluctuates our revenue and gross margin could be adversely affected important factors that could cause demand for our products to fluctuate include 

 if demand for our products is reduced our manufacturing andor assembly and test capacity could be underutilized and we may be required to record an impairment on our longlived assets including facilities and equipment as well as intangible assets which would increase our expenses in addition factory planning decisions may cause us to record accelerated depreciation in the long term if demand for our products increases we may not be able to add manufacturing andor assembly and test capacity fast enough to meet market demand these changes in demand for our products and changes in our customers’ product needs could have a variety of negative effects on our competitive position and our financial results and in certain cases may reduce our revenue increase our costs lower our gross margin percentage or require us to recognize and record impairments of our assets 

the semiconductor industry and our operations are characterized by a high percentage of costs that are fixed or otherwise difficult to reduce in the short term and by product demand that is highly variable and is subject to significant downturns that may adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the semiconductor industry and our operations are characterized by high costs such as those related to facility construction and equipment research and development and employment and training of a highly skilled workforce that are either fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term at the same time demand for our products is highly variable and has experienced downturns often in connection with maturing product cycles and downturns in general economic market conditions these downturns have been characterized by reduced product demand manufacturing overcapacity high inventory levels and decreased average selling prices the combination of these factors may cause our revenue gross margin cash flow and profitability to vary significantly both in the short term and over the long term 

we operate in intensely competitive industries and our failure to respond quickly to technological developments and incorporate new features into our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to compete 

we operate in intensely competitive industries that experience rapid technological developments changes in industry standards changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and improvements if we are unable to respond quickly and successfully to these developments we may lose our competitive position and our products or technologies may become uncompetitive or obsolete to compete successfully we must maintain a successful rd effort develop new products and production processes and improve our existing products and processes at the same pace or ahead of our competitors we may not be able to successfully develop and market these new products the products we invest in and develop may not be well received by customers and products developed and new technologies offered by others may affect the demand for our products these types of events could have a variety of negative effects on our competitive position and our financial results such as reducing our revenue increasing our costs lowering our gross margin percentage and requiring us to recognize and record impairments of our assets 

18 fluctuations in the mix of products sold may adversely affect our financial results 

because of the wide price differences among mobile desktop and server microprocessors the mix and types of performance capabilities of microprocessors sold affect the average selling price of our products and have a substantial impact on our revenue our financial results also depend in part on the mix of other products we sell such as chipsets flash memory and other semiconductor products in addition more recently introduced products tend to have higher associated costs because of initial overall development costs and higher startup costs fluctuations in the mix and types of our products may also affect the extent to which we are able to recover our fixed costs and investments that are associated with a particular product and as a result can negatively impact our financial results 

our global operations subject us to risks that may negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we have sales offices and research and development manufacturing and assembly and test facilities in many countries and as a result we are subject to risks associated with doing business globally our global operations may be subject to risks that may limit our ability to manufacture assemble and test design develop or sell products in particular countries which could in turn have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition including 

 in addition although most of our products are priced and paid for in us dollars a significant amount of certain types of expenses such as payroll utilities tax and marketing expenses are paid in local currencies fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and the currencies of other countries in which we conduct business and changes in currency controls with respect to such countries could negatively impact our business operating results and financial condition by resulting in lower revenue or increased expenses in such countries in addition changes in tariff and import regulations and to us and nonus monetary policies may also negatively impact our revenue in those affected countries varying tax rates in different jurisdictions could negatively impact our overall tax rate 

failure to meet our production targets resulting in undersupply or oversupply of products may adversely impact our business and results of operations 

manufacturing and assembly and test of integrated circuits is a complex process disruptions in this process can result from difficulties in our development and implementation of new processes errors and interruptions in the processes defects in materials and disruptions in our supply of materials or resources all of which could affect the timing of production ramps and yields furthermore we may not be successful or efficient in developing or implementing new production processes the occurrence of any of the foregoing may result in our failure to increase production as desired resulting in higher costs or substantial decreases in yields which could impact our ability to produce sufficient volume to meet specific product demand furthermore the unavailability or reduced availability of certain products could make it more difficult to implement our platform strategy we may also experience increases in yields a substantial increase in yields could result in higher inventory levels and the possibility of resulting excess capacity charges as we slow production to reduce inventory levels in addition higher yields as well as other factors can decrease overall unit costs and may cause us to revalue our existing inventory on certain products to their lower replacement cost which would impact our gross margin in the quarters in which this revaluation occurs the occurrence of any of these events could adversely impact our business and results of operations 

we may have difficulties obtaining the resources or products we need for manufacturing or assembling our products or operating other aspects of our business which could adversely affect our ability to meet demand for our products and may increase our costs 

we have thousands of suppliers providing various materials that we use in production of our products and other aspects of our business and we seek where possible to have several sources of supply for all of these materials however we may rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers or upon suppliers in a single country for these materials the inability of such suppliers to deliver adequate supplies of production materials or other supplies could disrupt our production process or could make it more difficult for us to implement our platform strategy in addition production could be disrupted by the unavailability of the resources used in production such as water silicon electricity and gases the unavailability or reduced availability of the materials or resources we use in our business may require us to reduce production of products or may require us to incur additional costs in order to obtain an adequate supply of these materials or resources the occurrence of any of these events could adversely impact our business and results of operations 

19 costs related to product defects and errata may have an adverse impact on our results of operations and business 

costs associated with unexpected product defects and errata deviations from published specifications include for example the costs of 

 these costs could be substantial and may therefore increase our expenses and adversely affect our gross margin in addition our reputation with our customers or end users of our products could be damaged as a result of such product defects and errata and the demand for our products could be reduced these factors could negatively impact our financial results and the prospects for our business 

we may be subject to claims of infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights which could adversely affect our business 

from time to time third parties may assert against us or our customers alleged patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our business we may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims from certain individuals and companies who have acquired patent portfolios for the sole purpose of asserting such claims against other companies any claims that our products or processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others regardless of the merit or resolution of such claims could cause us to incur significant costs in responding to defending and resolving such claims and may divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel away from our business as a result of such intellectual property infringement claims we could be required to 

 the occurrence of any of the foregoing could result in unexpected expenses or require us to recognize an impairment of our assets which would reduce the value of our assets and increase expenses in addition if we alter or discontinue our production of affected items our revenue could be negatively impacted 

we may be subject to litigation proceedings that could adversely affect our business 

in addition to the litigation risks mentioned above we may be subject to legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder consumer antitrust and other issues as described in “legal proceedings” in part i item 3 of this form 10k we are currently engaged in a number of litigation matters litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur an unfavorable ruling could include money damages or in cases for which injunctive relief is sought an injunction prohibiting intel from manufacturing or selling one or more products were an unfavorable ruling to occur there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on business and results of operations for the period in which the ruling occurred or future periods 

we may not be able to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights which may harm our ability to compete and adversely affect our business 

our ability to enforce our patents copyrights software licenses and other intellectual property is subject to general litigation risks as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our intellectual property rights in various countries when we seek to enforce our rights we are often subject to claims that the intellectual property right is invalid is otherwise not enforceable or is licensed to the party against whom we are asserting a claim in addition our assertion of intellectual property rights often results in the other party seeking to assert alleged intellectual property rights of its own against us which may adversely impact our business in the manner discussed above if we are not ultimately successful in defending ourselves against these claims in litigation we may not be able to sell a particular product or family of products due to an injunction or we may have to pay material amounts of damages which could in turn negatively affect our results of operations in addition governments may adopt regulations or courts may render decisions requiring compulsory licensing of intellectual property to others or governments may require that products meet specified standards that serve to favor local companies our inability to enforce our intellectual property rights under these circumstances may negatively impact our competitive position and our business 

20 our licenses with other companies and our participation in industry initiatives may allow other companies including competitors to use our patent rights 

companies in the semiconductor industry often rely on the ability to license patents from each other in order to compete many of our competitors have broad licenses or crosslicenses with us and under current case law some of these licenses may permit these competitors to pass our patent rights on to others if one of these licensees becomes a foundry our competitors might be able to avoid our patent rights in manufacturing competing products in addition our participation in industry initiatives may require us to license our patents to other companies that adopt certain industry standards or specifications even when such organizations do not adopt standards or specifications proposed by us as a result our patents implicated by our participation in industry initiatives might not be available for us to enforce against others who might otherwise be deemed to be infringing those patents our costs of enforcing our licenses or protecting our patents may increase and the value of our intellectual property may be impaired 

in order to compete we must attract retain and motivate key employees and our failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

in order to compete we must attract retain and motivate executives and other key employees including those in managerial technical sales marketing and support positions hiring and retaining qualified executives scientists engineers technical staff and sales representatives are critical to our business and competition for experienced employees in the semiconductor industry can be intense to attract retain and motivate qualified employees we rely heavily on stockbased incentive awards such as employee stock options and restricted stock if the value of such stock awards does not appreciate as measured by the performance of the price of our common stock andor if our other stockbased compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit our ability to attract retain and motivate our employees could be adversely impacted which could negatively affect our results of operations andor require us to increase the amount we expend on cash and other forms of compensation in addition our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” during our first quarter of 2006 will result in significant additional compensation expense compared to prior periods 

our results of operations could vary as a result of the methods estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies 

the methods estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations see “critical accounting estimates” in part ii item 7 of this form 10k such methods estimates and judgments are by their nature subject to substantial risks uncertainties and assumptions and factors may arise over time that lead us to change our methods estimates and judgments changes in those methods estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations in particular beginning in our first quarter of 2006 the calculation of sharebased compensation expense under sfas no 123r will require us to use valuation methodologies which were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options and a number of assumptions estimates and conclusions regarding matters such as expected forfeitures expected volatility of our share price the expected dividend rate with respect to our common stock and the exercise behavior of our employees furthermore there are no means under applicable accounting principles to compare and adjust our expense if and when we learn of additional information that may affect the estimates that we previously made with the exception of changes in expected forfeitures of sharebased awards factors may arise over time that lead us to change our estimates and assumptions with respect to future sharebased compensation arrangements resulting in variability in our sharebased compensation expense over time changes in forecasted sharebased compensation expense could impact our gross margin percentage research and development expenses marketing general and administrative expenses and our tax rate 

our failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations worldwide could adversely impact our business and results of operations 

the manufacture assembly and testing of our products require the use of hazardous materials that are subject to a broad array of environmental health and safety laws and regulations our failure to comply with any of these applicable laws or regulations could result in 

 in addition our failure to properly manage the use transportation emission discharge storage recycling or disposal of hazardous materials could subject us to increased costs or future liabilities existing and future environmental laws and regulations could also require us to acquire pollution abatement or remediation equipment modify our product designs or incur other expenses associated with such laws and regulations many new materials that we are evaluating for use in our operations may be subject to regulation under existing or future environmental laws and regulations that may restrict our use of certain materials in our manufacturing assembly and test processes or products any of these consequences could adversely impact our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses andor requiring us to alter our manufacturing processes 

21 changes in our effective tax rate may have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

our future effective tax rates may be adversely affected by a number of factors including 

 any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could adversely impact net income for future periods 

in addition the us internal revenue service irs and other tax authorities regularly examine our income tax returns the irs has issued formal assessments related to amounts reflected on certain of our tax returns as a tax benefit for our export sales see “note 18 contingencies” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k our results of operations could be adversely impacted if these assessments or any other assessments resulting from the examination of our income tax returns by the irs or other taxing authorities are not resolved in our favor 

we invest in companies for strategic reasons and may not realize a return on our investments 

we make investments in companies around the world to further our strategic objectives and support our key business initiatives such investments include investments in equity securities of public companies and investments in nonmarketable equity securities of private companies which range from earlystage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies whose products or technologies may directly support an intel product or initiative the success of these companies or lack thereof is dependent on product development market acceptance operational efficiency and other key business success factors the private companies in which we invest may fail because they may not be able to secure additional funding obtain favorable investment terms for future financings or take advantage of liquidity events such as initial public offerings mergers and private sales if any of these private companies fail we could lose all or part of our investment in that company in addition if we determine that an otherthantemporary decline in the fair value exists for the equity securities of the public and private companies in which we invest we write down the investment to its fair value and record the related writedown as an investment loss furthermore when the strategic objectives of an investment have been achieved or if the investment or business diverges from our strategic objectives we may decide to dispose of the investment our investments in nonmarketable equity securities of private companies are not liquid and we may not be able to dispose of these investments on favorable terms or at all the occurrence of any of these events could negatively affect our net income and results of operations

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend a tax matters 

in connection with the irs’s regular examination of intel’s tax returns for the years 1999 and 2000 the irs formally assessed in early 2005 certain adjustments to the amounts reflected by us on those returns as a tax benefit for export sales also in 2005 the irs formally assessed similar adjustments to the amounts reflected by us for the years 2001 and 2002 as a tax benefit for export sales we do not agree with these adjustments and have appealed the assessments if the irs prevails in its position our federal income tax due for 1999 through 2002 would increase by approximately 10 billion plus interest the irs may make similar claims for years subsequent to 2002 in future audits and if the irs prevails income tax due for 2003 through 2005 would increase by approximately 12 billion plus interest 

although the final resolution of the adjustments is uncertain based on currently available information management believes that the ultimate outcome will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position cash flows or overall trends in results of operations there is the possibility of a material adverse impact on the results of operations of the period in which the matter is ultimately resolved if it is resolved unfavorably or in the period in which an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable 

23 b litigation 

intel currently is a party to various legal proceedings including those noted below while management presently believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings individually and in the aggregate will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position cash flows or overall trends in results of operations litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur an unfavorable ruling could include money damages or in cases for which injunctive relief is sought an injunction prohibiting intel from selling one or more products were an unfavorable ruling to occur there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the business or results of operations for the period in which the ruling occurs or future periods

strategy 

our goal is to be the preeminent provider of silicon chips and platform solutions to the worldwide digital economy as part of our overall strategy to compete in each relevant market segment we use our core competencies in the design and manufacture of integrated circuits as well as our financial resources global presence and brand recognition our primary focus is on developing advanced integrated silicon technology solutions 

our strategy focuses on taking customer needs into account in developing the next generation of products and platforms that will enable new form factors and new usage models for businesses and consumers we believe that the end users of computing and communications systems and devices want products based on platform solutions we define a platform as a collection of technologies that are designed to work together to provide a better enduser solution than if the ingredients were used separately our platforms consist of standards and initiatives such as wifi and wimax hardware and software that may include technologies such as ht technology intel virtualization technology and intel amt and services in developing our platforms we may include ingredients sold by other companies the success of our strategy to offer platform solutions is dependent on our ability to select and incorporate ingredients that customers value and to market the platforms effectively 

we also believe that users of computing and communications systems and devices want improved overall performance andor improved performance per watt improved overall performance can include faster processing performance andor other improved capabilities such as multithreading andor multitasking and improved connectivity security manageability reliability ease of use andor interoperability among devices improved performance per watt involves balancing the addition of these types of improved performance factors with the power consumption of the platform lower power consumption may reduce system heat output provide power savings and reduce the total cost of ownership for the end user it is our goal to incorporate these improvements in our various products and platforms to meet enduser demands in line with these efforts we are focusing our efforts on dualcore microprocessors dualcore microprocessors contain two processor cores rather than just one processor core which enables improved multitasking with improved performance per watt 

we make equity investments in companies around the world to further our strategic objectives and support our key business initiatives including investments through our intel capital program we generally focus on investing in companies and initiatives to stimulate growth in the digital economy create new business opportunities for intel and expand global markets for our products the investments may support among other things intel product initiatives emerging trends in the technology industry or worldwide internet deployment we invest in companies that develop software hardware or services supporting our technologies our current investment focus areas include helping to enable mobile wireless devices advance the digital home enhance the digital enterprise advance highperformance communications infrastructures and develop the next generation of silicon production technologies our focus areas tend to develop and change over time due to rapid advancements in technology

critical accounting estimates 

the methods estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements which we discuss under the heading “results of operations” following this section of our mda some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain our most critical accounting estimates include the valuation of nonmarketable equity securities which impacts net gains losses on equity securities when we record impairments recognition and measurement of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities which impact our tax provision assessment of recoverability of longlived assets which primarily impacts gross margin when we impair manufacturing assets or accelerate their depreciation and valuation of inventory which impacts gross margin below we discuss these policies further as well as the estimates and judgments involved we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies such as policies for revenue recognition including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors however these policies typically do not require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 

nonmarketable equity securities 

we typically invest in nonmarketable equity securities of private companies which range from earlystage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies whose products or technologies may directly support an intel product or initiative at december 31 2005 the carrying value of our portfolio of strategic investments in nonmarketable equity securities excluding equity derivatives totaled 561 million 507 million at december 25 2004 

investments in nonmarketable equity securities are inherently risky and a number of these companies are likely to fail their success or lack thereof is dependent on product development market acceptance operational efficiency and other key business success factors in addition depending on their future prospects they may not be able to raise additional funds when needed or they may receive lower valuations with less favorable investment terms than in previous financings and the investments would likely become impaired 

we review our investments quarterly for indicators of impairment however for nonmarketable equity securities the impairment analysis requires significant judgment to identify events or circumstances that would likely have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment the indicators that we use to identify those events or circumstances include a the investee’s revenue and earnings trends relative to predefined milestones and overall business prospects b the technological feasibility of the investee’s products and technologies c the general market conditions in the investee’s industry or geographic area including adverse regulatory or economic changes d factors related to the investee’s ability to remain in business such as the investee’s liquidity debt ratios and the rate at which the investee is using its cash and e the investee’s receipt of additional funding at a lower valuation 

investments identified as having an indicator of impairment are subject to further analysis to determine if the investment is other than temporarily impaired in which case we write the investment down to its impaired value when an investee is not considered viable from a financial or technological point of view we write down the entire investment since we consider the estimated fair market value to be nominal if an investee obtains additional funding at a valuation lower than our carrying amount or requires a new round of equity funding to stay in operation and the new funding does not appear imminent we presume that the investment is other than temporarily impaired unless specific facts and circumstances indicate otherwise impairments of investments in our portfolio of nonmarketable equity securities were approximately 103 million in 2005 115 million in 2004 and 319 million in 2003 

income taxes 

we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits tax benefits and deductions such as the tax benefit for export sales and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 

we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets if recovery is not likely we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable we believe that a substantial majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our balance sheet will ultimately be recovered however should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely 

30 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

continued 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional tax payments are probable if we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary we record an additional charge in our provision for taxes in the period in which we determine that the recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be for a discussion of current tax matters see “note 10 provision for taxes” and “note 18 contingencies” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

longlived assets 

we assess the impairment of longlived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant underperformance of a business or product line in relation to expectations significant negative industry or economic trends and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets recoverability of assets that will continue to be used in our operations is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to our estimate of the related total future net cash flows if an asset grouping’s carrying value is not recoverable through the related cash flows the asset grouping is considered to be impaired the impairment is measured by the difference between the asset grouping’s carrying amount and its fair value based on the best information available including market prices or discounted cash flow analysis 

impairments of longlived assets are determined for groups of assets related to the lowest level of identifiable independent cash flows due to our asset usage model and the interchangeable nature of our semiconductor manufacturing capacity we must make subjective judgments in determining the independent cash flows that can be related to specific asset groupings in addition as we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions we must make subjective judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets primarily processspecific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements when we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated and there are sufficient cash flows to support the carrying value of the assets we accelerate the rate of depreciation charges in order to fully depreciate the assets over their new shorter useful lives impairments and accelerated depreciation of longlived assets were approximately 20 million in 2005 approximately 50 million in 2004 and 220 million in 2003 

inventory 

the valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality the determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products within specific time horizons generally six months or less the estimates of future demand that we use in the valuation of inventory are the same as those used in our published revenue forecasts and are also consistent with the estimates used in our shortterm manufacturing plans if our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly we could be required to write down additional inventory which would have a negative impact on our gross margin

results of operations 

overview 

2005 was a year of many notable accomplishments for intel we experienced our third year of doubledigit growth in annual revenue gross margin dollars operating profit and net income the majority of the growth during 2005 was due to the success of our notebook computing platforms our financial position remains strong and we generated 148 billion in cash flows from operations in 2005 we were able to return a total of 126 billion to stockholders through our highest level of stock repurchases and dividends in our company’s history we also underwent the largest reorganization in our company’s history which realigned our company around platform solutions and we embarked on a massive rebranding effort while the first half was strong our results for the second half were lower than seasonal our results for the fourth quarter were lower than expected primarily due to the strong competitive landscape 

in 2006 we are planning for further growth in revenue and gross margin dollars although we expect this growth to be tempered somewhat from the growth rates of recent years due to the expectation of some pricing pressure and a sustained competitive landscape however with the introduction of compelling new platforms and a strong processor roadmap we believe that we are positioned well for future growth our new platforms include the recently introduced intel centrino duo mobile technology and our new platform brand for the digital home intel viiv technology we also expect to launch a new microarchitecture in the second half of 2006 that we believe will deliver performanceper watt leadership in the desktop mobile and server market segments in addition we are focusing on new business opportunities including the introduction of intel microprocessorbased systems by apple computer inc and our entrance into the nand flash memory market through imft the venture we formed in january 2006 with micron we anticipate that a fast ramp of our dualcore microprocessor products on our industryleading 65nanometer process technology will enable and enhance these growth opportunities the ramp of our 65nanometer microprocessor products will also enable increased chipset capacity as we transition our chipset production to our 90nanometer process technology 

the following table sets forth the consolidated statements of income and the related percentages of net revenue for the periods indicated 

 32 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

continued 

the following table sets forth information on our geographic regions for the periods indicated 

 our net revenue for 2005 was 388 billion an increase of 46 billion or 135 compared to 2004 this increase was primarily due to higher revenue from sales of mobile microprocessors and higher chipset revenue fiscal year 2005 was a 53week fiscal year in contrast to fiscal year 2004 which was a 52week fiscal year 

our asiapacific region’s revenue was approximately 50 of our total revenue in 2005 and continues to be our fastest growing region increasing 26 compared to 2004 and reflecting the movement of more of our customers’ pc supply chains to asia this movement in the supply chain has negatively affected our sales in the americas region which decreased 5 compared to 2004 japan revenue increased 19 and europe revenue increased 6 during 2005 compared to 2004 we continued to see growth in both mature and emerging markets 

overall gross margin dollars for 2005 were 230 billion an increase of 33 billion or 17 compared to 2004 our overall gross margin percentage increased to 594 in 2005 from 577 in 2004 the overall gross margin percentage was positively affected by a mix shift of our total revenue to the mobility group which has a higher gross margin percentage the gross margin percentages for the digital enterprise group and flash memory group were higher and the gross margin percentage for the mobility group was lower in 2005 compared to 2004 as a result of a litigation settlement agreement with microunity we recorded a 140 million charge to cost of sales in 2005 of which 110 million was allocated to the digital enterprise group and 30 million was allocated to the mobility group the 2004 gross margin was affected by a litigation settlement with intergraph in which we recorded a 162 million charge to cost of sales of which 120 million was allocated to the digital enterprise group and 42 million was allocated to the mobility group see business outlook later in this section for a discussion of gross margin expectations 

our net revenue for 2004 was 342 billion an increase of 41 billion or 135 compared to 2003 this increase was primarily due to higher net revenue from sales of microprocessors in the digital enterprise group and the mobility group operating segments 

in 2004 our asiapacific region’s revenue made up the largest portion of our total revenue and increased 26 reflecting both growth in local consumption and movement of more of the production for our customers’ pc supply chains to asia this movement in the supply chain negatively affected the americas region with a decrease in revenue of 5 in 2004 compared to 2003 japan revenue increased 15 and the europe region’s revenue increased 13 in 2004 compared to 2003 

overall gross margin dollars for 2004 were 197 billion an increase of 27 billion or 16 compared to 2003 our overall gross margin percentage increased to 577 in 2004 from 567 in 2003 as a result of a litigation settlement agreement with intergraph we recorded a 162 million charge to cost of sales in 2004 the gross margin percentage for the digital enterprise group operating segment was higher than in 2003 and the gross margin percentages for the mobility group and flash memory group operating segments were approximately flat compared to 2003

digital enterprise group 

the revenue and operating income for the digital enterprise group deg for the three years ended december 31 2005 were as follows 

 revenue for the deg operating segment was approximately flat compared to 2004 revenue from sales of microprocessors was approximately flat with slightly higher unit sales being offset by slightly lower average selling prices revenue from sales of server microprocessors in 2005 was negatively affected by the highly competitive server market chipsets motherboard and other revenue was higher primarily due to higher average selling prices of chipsets microprocessors within deg include microprocessors designed for the desktop and enterprise computing market segments previously included within the former intel architecture business operating segment as well as embedded microprocessors revenue from network processors which are based on our intel xscale technology is included in other revenue above 

operating income was also approximately flat at 90 billion in 2005 compared to 885 billion in 2004 the operating income for deg was positively affected by lower microprocessor unit costs and higher chipset revenue these improvements were offset by approximately 380 million of higher startup costs in 2005 primarily related to our 65nanometer process technology products based on our 65nanometer process technology began shipping in the fourth quarter of 2005 although revenue was flat operating expenses increased in 2005 which negatively affected operating income both periods were negatively affected by litigation settlement agreements results for 2005 included a charge related to a settlement agreement with microunity and results for 2004 included a charge related to a settlement agreement with intergraph 

for 2004 revenue for the deg operating segment increased by 17 billion or 7 compared to 2003 the increase in deg revenue was primarily due to higher unit sales of microprocessors and motherboards the increase was partially offset by lower average selling prices for microprocessors designed for desktop platforms and lower chipset revenue we ramped our 90nanometer process technology in 2004 and exited the year with the majority of microprocessors shipped by the deg operating segment being manufactured on this technology 

operating income increased to 885 billion in 2004 compared to 80 billion in 2003 the increase was primarily due to the impact of higher revenue and lower unit costs for microprocessors as well as approximately 160 million of lower manufacturing startup costs these increases in operating income were partially offset by higher operating expenses lower chipset revenue and the negative impact of reducing the carrying value of ending chipset inventory to lower current replacement costs in addition we recorded a charge in 2004 related to a settlement agreement with intergraph

mobility group 

the revenue and operating income for the mobility group mg for the three years ended december 31 2005 were as follows 

 revenue for the mg operating segment increased by 415 billion or 59 in 2005 compared to 2004 this increase was primarily due to significantly higher revenue from sales of microprocessors which increased 30 billion or 54 in 2005 compared to 2004 reflecting the continued growth in the notebook market segment increased use of microprocessors designed specifically for mobile platforms in notebook computers also contributed to the higher revenue the higher revenue from sales of microprocessors was due to significantly higher unit sales partially offset by lower average selling prices primarily due to higher unit sales of the celeron m processor our value mobile processor revenue from sales of chipsets and wireless connectivity products also increased significantly in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to the success of intel centrino mobile technology revenue from application processors which are based on intel xscale technology increased due to growth in dataenabled cellular phones and is included in “chipset motherboard and other revenue” above 

operating income increased to 53 billion in 2005 from 28 billion in 2004 the significant increase in operating income was primarily due to higher revenue in addition operating expenses for the mg operating segment did not increase as fast as revenue and microprocessor unit costs were lower these increases in operating income were partially offset by approximately 170 million of higher startup costs in 2005 primarily related to our 65nanometer process technology products based on our 65nanometer process technology began shipping in the fourth quarter of 2005 

for 2004 revenue for the mg operating segment increased by 19 billion or 37 compared to 2003 the increase in mg revenue was primarily due to substantially higher unit sales of microprocessors designed for notebooks the increase in revenue was primarily due to the success of our intel centrino mobile technology platform which also resulted in higher sales of mobile chipset products and wireless connectivity products we ramped our 90nanometer process technology in 2004 and exited the year with the majority of microprocessors shipped by the mg operating segment being manufactured on this technology 

operating income increased to 28 billion in 2004 compared to 17 billion in 2003 the increase was primarily due to the impact of higher revenue and lower unit costs for microprocessors these increases in operating income were partially offset by higher operating expenses

flash memory group 

the revenue and operating loss for the flash memory group fmg for the three years ended december 31 2005 were as follows 

 revenue for the fmg operating segment remained approximately flat in 2005 at 23 billion compared to 2004 revenue was positively affected by higher unit sales and negatively affected by lower average selling prices operating loss remained approximately flat in 2005 at 154 million compared to 149 million in 2004 the operating loss was positively affected by lower unit costs and negatively affected by higher operating expenses in 2006 we will continue ramping intel strataflash products on 90nanometer process technology and plan to grow revenue within the highly competitive nor market segment additionally in 2006 fmg will also include the results of sales of nand flash memory products 

for 2004 revenue for the fmg operating segment increased 677 million or 42 compared to 2003 the increase in fmg revenue was primarily due to higher unit sales operating loss remained approximately flat in 2004 at 149 million compared to 152 million in 2003 the operating loss was positively affected by higher revenue as well as approximately 100 million from lower inventory writeoffs for flash memory products due to improved demand and sales of nor flash memory inventory that had been previously written down this positive effect was offset by higher unit costs for flash memory products as we sold higher density products and by the impact of reducing the carrying value of ending inventory to lower current replacement costs 

operating expenses 

operating expenses for the three years ended december 31 2005 were as follows 

 research and development spending increased 367 million or 8 in 2005 compared to 2004 and increased 418 million or 10 in 2004 compared to 2003 the increase in 2005 compared to 2004 was primarily due to higher headcount and profitdependent compensation expenses partially offset by lower expenses related to development for our nextgeneration 65nanometer manufacturing process technology in addition fiscal year 2005 included 53 weeks in contrast to 52 weeks in 2004 the increase in 2004 compared to 2003 was primarily due to higher expenses related to development of manufacturing process technologies including our 65nanometer process on 300mm wafers and higher expenses for product development programs as well as higher profitdependent compensation expenses 

marketing general and administrative expenses increased 10 billion or 22 in 2005 compared to 2004 and increased 381 million or 9 in 2004 compared to 2003 the increase in 2005 was primarily due to higher marketing program spending higher headcount and higher profitdependent compensation expenses as well as the extra work week the increase in 2004 was primarily due to higher cooperative advertising expenses as a result of higher revenue from sales of microprocessors in the deg and mg operating segments and because our customers used a higher percentage of their available intel inside program funds and increased profitdependent compensation expenses in addition the increase was due to higher marketing expenses from additional marketing programs and increased advertising expenses 

research and development along with marketing general and administrative expenses were 28 of net revenue in 2005 and 2004 and 29 of net revenue in 2003

amortization of acquisitionrelated intangibles and costs was 126 million in 2005 179 million in 2004 and 301 million in 2003 the decreased amortization each year compared to the previous year was primarily due to a portion of the intangibles related to prior acquisitions becoming fully amortized 

during 2005 and 2004 we completed annual reviews and concluded that goodwill was not impaired in either year during 2003 under the former reporting unit structure we found indicators of impairment of goodwill and recorded a noncash impairment charge of 611 million which was included as a component of operating income in the “all other” category for segment reporting purposes under the former reporting structure the wireless communications business unit had not performed as management had expected it became apparent that the business was expected to grow more slowly than had previously been projected a slowerthanexpected rollout of products and slowerthanexpected customer acceptance of the reporting unit’s products in the cellular baseband processor business as well as a delay in the transition to nextgeneration phone networks had pushed out the forecasts for sales into highend data cell phones these factors resulted in lower growth expectations for the reporting unit and triggered the goodwill impairment also during 2003 the goodwill related to one of our seed businesses included in the “all other” category was impaired 

losses on equity securities interest and other and provision for taxes 

losses on equity securities net interest and other net and provision for taxes for the three years ended december 31 2005 were as follows 

 losses on equity securities net for 2005 were 45 million compared to 2 million for 2004 the net loss for 2005 included impairments of 208 million primarily due to a 105 million impairment charge on our investment in micron the impairment was principally based on our assessment during the second quarter of 2005 of micron’s financial results and the fact that the market price of micron’s stock had been below our cost basis for an extended period of time as well as the competitive pricing environment for dram products the net loss for 2004 included impairments of approximately 117 million primarily on nonmarketable equity securities gains on equity transactions of 163 million largely offset the impairments for 2005 115 million for 2004 

losses on equity securities net for 2004 were 2 million compared to 283 million for 2003 the improvement was primarily driven by lower impairment charges on investments particularly on nonmarketable equity securities 117 million for 2004 and 319 million for 2003 the decrease in the impairment charges in 2004 reflected the decrease in the total carrying amount of the nonmarketable equity investment portfolio that had occurred over the previous couple of years both periods had gains on equity transactions that offset impairments 

interest and other net increased to 565 million in 2005 compared to 289 million in 2004 reflecting higher interest income as a result of higher interest rates interest and other net increased to 289 million in 2004 compared to 192 million in 2003 reflecting higher interest income as a result of higher average investment balances and higher interest rates interest and other net for 2004 also included approximately 60 million of gains associated with terminating financing arrangements for manufacturing facilities and equipment in ireland 

our effective income tax rate was 313 in 2005 278 in 2004 and 242 in 2003 the rate for 2005 included an increase to the tax provision of approximately 265 million as a result of the decision to repatriate foreign earnings under the american jobs creation act of 2004 the jobs act which was partially offset by the reversal of previously accrued items the tax rate for 2004 included a 195 million reduction to the tax provision primarily from additional benefits for export sales along with state tax benefits for divestitures as well as the reversal of previously accrued taxes primarily related to the closing of a state income tax audit the rate for 2003 included a 758 million reduction to the tax provision related to divestitures partially offset by the nondeductible goodwill impairment charge

financial condition 

our financial condition remains strong at december 31 2005 cash shortterm investments and fixed income debt instruments included in trading assets totaled 124 billion down from 168 billion at december 25 2004 at december 31 2005 total shortterm and longterm debt was 24 billion and represented 67 of stockholders’ equity at december 25 2004 total debt was 904 million and represented 23 of stockholders’ equity 

cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain noncash items and changes in assets and liabilities for 2005 cash provided by operating activities was 148 billion compared to 131 billion in 2004 and 115 billion in 2003 in 2005 compared to 2004 the majority of the increase in cash provided by operating activities was from maturities of trading assets in excess of purchases and higher net income in 2004 compared to 2003 the majority of the increase in cash provided by operating activities was due to higher net income income taxes payable increased compared to 2004 due to timing of estimated payments and the impact of repatriation under the jobs act accounts receivable increased in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to higher revenue and a higher proportion of sales occurring at the end of the fourth quarter accounts receivable was approximately flat in 2004 compared to 2003 for 2005 our two largest customers accounted for 35 of net revenue with one of these customers accounting for 19 of revenue and another customer accounting for 16 for 2004 our two largest customers accounted for 35 of net revenue 34 of net revenue for 2003 additionally these two largest customers accounted for 42 of net accounts receivable at december 31 2005 34 at december 25 2004 and 31 at december 27 2003 inventories in 2005 increased compared to 2004 levels primarily due to ramping of new products inventories were approximately flat in 2004 compared to 2003 levels 

investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures the proceeds from investment maturities and payment for investments acquired we used 64 billion in net cash for investing activities during 2005 compared to 50 billion during 2004 and 71 billion during 2003 the higher cash used in investing activities in 2005 compared to 2004 resulted from capital spending primarily driven by investments in 65nanometer production equipment capital spending was 58 billion in 2005 38 billion in 2004 and 37 billion in 2003 capital spending for 2006 is expected to be 69 billion plus or minus 200 million primarily driven by investments in 300mm 45nanometer production equipment during 2005 we also paid 191 million in cash for acquisitions net of cash acquired other investing activities included intellectual property assets acquired as a result of a settlement agreement with microunity for 160 million the higher net purchases of availableforsale investments in 2004 compared to 2005 were due to improved corporate credit profiles that facilitated a slight shift in our portfolio of investments in debt securities to longer term maturities the higher cash used in investing activities in 2003 compared to 2004 also resulted from higher net purchases of availableforsale investments due to improved corporate credit profiles that facilitated a slight shift in our portfolio of investments in debt securities to longer term maturities that year 

financing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases and retirement of common stock payment of dividends to stockholders and additions to longterm debt we used 95 billion in net cash for financing activities in 2005 compared to 77 billion in 2004 and 39 billion in 2003 during 2005 our board of directors amended the company’s ongoing authorization to repurchase up to 25 billion in shares of intel’s common stock in open market or negotiated transactions and in 2005 we purchased 418 million shares of common stock for 106 billion 301 million shares for 75 billion in 2004 and 176 million shares for 40 billion in 2003 at december 31 2005 219 billion remained available for repurchase under existing repurchase authorizations payment of dividends was 20 billion in 2005 10 billion in 2004 and 524 million in 2003 due to an increase in the quarterly cash dividend from 004 per share to 008 per share effective beginning in the first quarter of 2005 on january 19 2006 our board of directors declared a cash dividend of 010 per share effective the first quarter of 2006 the dividend is payable on march 1 2006 to stockholders of record on february 7 2006 additions to longterm debt included 16 billion in proceeds from the issuance of 295 junior subordinated convertible debentures the debentures due 2035 the proceeds from the debentures are available for general corporate purposes as well as to purchase shares of intel common stock additions to longterm debt also included 160 million in 4375 bonds issued by the industrial development authority of the city of chandler arizona the arizona bonds due 2035 the proceeds from the issuance of the arizona bonds will be used to finance the costs of acquisition construction and installation of certain industrial sewage and wastewater treatment facilities and solid waste disposal facilities as part of our semiconductor manufacturing plant located in the city of chandler arizona financing sources of cash during 2005 also included 12 billion in proceeds from the sale of shares pursuant to employee equity incentive plans 894 million in 2004 and 967 million in 2003 

during january 2006 micron and intel formed imft as part of the initial capital contribution to imft intel paid 500 million in cash in january 2006 issued 581 million in notes and owes an additional 115 million in cash in exchange for a 49 interest in imft

another potential source of liquidity is authorized borrowings including commercial paper of 30 billion maximum borrowings under our commercial paper program during 2005 were approximately 150 million although no commercial paper was outstanding at the end of the period we also maintain the ability to issue an aggregate of 14 billion in debt equity and other securities under sec shelf registration statements 

we believe that we have the financial resources needed to meet business requirements for the next 12 months including capital expenditures for the expansion or upgrading of worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test capacity working capital requirements the dividend program potential stock repurchases and potential future acquisitions or strategic investments 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at december 31 2005 which are expected to have an effect on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 

   contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on intel and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction subsequent to yearend 2005 we entered into an agreement in which we have a contractual obligation to purchase the output of imft initially in proportion to our investment in imft which is currently 49 see “note 16 venture” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

our purchase orders for other products are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons in addition some of our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements we generally do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities and predetermined prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months therefore agreements for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above agreements for outsourced services generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty and are therefore not included in the table above

contractual obligations that are contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones are not included in the table above these obligations include contingent funding obligations and milestonebased equity investment funding these arrangements are not considered contractual obligations until the milestone is met by the third party as of december 31 2005 assuming that all future milestones are met additional required payments would be approximately 39 million obligations to employees and nonemployee directors related to our equity incentive plans are not included in the table above as these arrangements do not result in a future cash outflow 

the expected timing of payments of the obligations above is estimated based on current information timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations amounts disclosed as contingent or milestonebased obligations are dependent on the achievement of the milestones or the occurrence of the contingent events and can vary significantly 

in january 2006 we entered into various contractual commitments in relation to our investment in imft some of these commitments are with micron and some are with the newly formed company imft the following are the significant contractual commitments entered into in january 2006 

 offbalancesheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2005 we did not have any significant offbalancesheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk

employee equity incentive plans 

our equity incentive programs are broadbased longterm retention programs that are intended to attract and retain talented employees and align stockholder and employee interests under the 2004 equity incentive plan the 2004 plan 240 million shares of common stock were made available for issuance during the twoyear period ending june 30 2006 in may 2005 we obtained stockholder approval to extend the term of the 2004 plan by one year to june 30 2007 and to make an additional 130 million shares of common stock available for issuance as equity awards to employees and nonemployee directors 

our goal has been to keep the potential incremental dilution related to our equity incentive programs to a longterm average of less than 2 annually the dilution percentage is calculated using the new option grants for the year net of options cancelled due to employees leaving the company and expired options divided by the total outstanding shares at the beginning of the year 

options granted to employees including officers and nonemployee directors from 2001 through 2005 are summarized as follows 

   in accordance with a policy established by the compensation committee of the board of directors total options granted to the listed officers may not exceed 5 of total options granted in any year during 2005 options granted to listed officers amounted to 14 of the grants made to all employees all stock option grants to executive officers are determined by the compensation committee all members of the compensation committee are independent directors as defined in the applicable rules for issuers traded on the nasdaq stock market 

for additional information regarding equity incentive plans and the activity for the past three years see “note 11 employee equity incentive plans” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k information regarding our equity incentive plans should be read in conjunction with the information appearing under the heading “report of the compensation committee on executive compensation” in our 2006 proxy statement which is incorporated herein by reference

  1997 stock option plan 

the 1997 stock option plan the 1997 plan provided for the grant of stock options to employees other than officers and directors this plan which was not approved by stockholders was terminated as to future grants when the 2004 plan was approved by the stockholders in may 2004 the 1997 plan is administered by the compensation committee of the board of directors which has the power to determine matters relating to outstanding option awards under the plan including conditions of vesting and exercisability options granted under the 1997 plan expire no later than 10 years from the grant date options granted prior to 2003 under this plan generally vest in five years and options granted under this plan in 2003 and 2004 generally vest in increments over four or five years from the date of grant certain grants to key employees have delayed vesting generally beginning six years from the date of grant

business outlook 

nongaap financial measures 

in addition to disclosing financial results calculated in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap the forecasts below contain nongaap financial measures that exclude the effects of sharebased compensation expense and the requirements of sfas no 123r commencing with our first quarter of 2006 we will include nongaap financial measures of our financial results for the reporting period that exclude the income statement effects of sharebased compensation and the effects of sfas no 123r upon the number of diluted shares used in calculating nongaap earnings per share for further discussion on the requirements of sfas no 123r see “recent accounting pronouncements” within “note 2 accounting policies” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k the nongaap financial measures disclosed should not be considered a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap and the financial results calculated in accordance with gaap and reconciliations to those financial statements should be carefully evaluated the nongaap financial measures used by us may be calculated differently from and therefore may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 

we will apply the modified prospective method of adoption of sfas no 123r under which the effects of sfas no 123r will be reflected in our gaap financial statement presentations for and after the first quarter of 2006 but will not be reflected in results for prior periods gross margin expenses research and development and marketing general and administrative operating income income taxes net income and earnings per share are the primary financial measures that management uses for planning and forecasting future periods affected by sharedbased compensation because management will continue to review these financial measures calculated without taking into account the effects of the new requirements under sfas no 123r upon implementation of sfas no 123r these financial measures are treated as “nongaap financial measures” under sec rules management uses the nongaap financial measures for internal managerial purposes including as a means to compare periodto period results on both a segment basis and consolidated basis and as a means to evaluate our results on a consolidated basis compared to those of other companies in addition management uses certain of these measures when publicly providing forwardlooking statements on expectations regarding future consolidatedbasis financial results 

our sharebased compensation programs are established and managed on a corporatewide basis including specification of grant types and amount ranges for employees by category and grade following implementation of sfas no 123r segment managers will not be held accountable for sharebased compensation charges impacting their business unit’s operating income loss and accordingly sharebased compensation charges will be excluded from our measure of segment profitability operating income therefore the review of segment results by management and the board of directors will exclude sharebased compensation 

additionally management and the board of directors will continue to compare our historical consolidated results of operations revenue gross margin research and development marketing general and administrative expenses operating income net income and earnings per share excluding sharebased compensation to financial information prepared on the same basis during our budget and planning process to assess the business and to compare consolidated results to the objectives identified by us our budget and planning process commences with a segmentlevel evaluation— which as noted above excludes sharebased compensation— and culminates with the preparation of a consolidated annual andor quarterly budget that includes these nongaap financial measures gross margin research and development expenses marketing general and administrative expenses operating income income tax expense net income and earnings per share this budget once finalized and approved serves as the basis for allocation of resources and management of operations while sharebased compensation is a significant expense affecting our results of operations management excludes sharebased compensation from our consolidated budget and planning process to facilitate periodto period comparisons and to assess changes in gross margin dollar net income and earnings per share targets in relation to changes in forecasted revenue 

profitdependent cashincentive pay to employees including senior management also is calculated using formulae that incorporate our annual results operating income andor earnings per share excluding sharebased compensation expense for example for 2006 the executive compensation cash incentive plan formula measures earnings per share as the greater of our operating income or our net income divided by weighted average diluted common shares outstanding in both cases excluding the effects of sharebased compensation 

we disclose this information to the public to enable investors to more easily assess our performance on the same basis applied by management and to ease comparison on both a gaap and nongaap basis among other companies that separately identify sharebased compensation expenses in particular as we begin to apply sfas no 123r we believe that it is useful to investors to understand how the expenses and other adjustments associated with the application of sfas no 123r are being reflected on our income statements 

43 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

continued 

although these nongaap financial measures adjust expense and diluted share items to exclude the accounting treatment of sharebased compensation they should not be viewed as a pro forma presentation reflecting the elimination of the underlying sharebased compensation programs as those programs are an important element of our compensation structure and gaap indicate that all forms of sharebased payments should be valued and included as appropriate in results of operations management takes into consideration this aspect of the nongaap financial measures by evaluating the dilutive effect of our sharebased compensation arrangements on our basic and diluted earnings per share calculations and by reviewing other quantitative and qualitative information regarding our sharebased compensation arrangements including the information provided under the heading “employee equity incentive plans” earlier in the “management’s discussion and analysis” section of this form 10k 

2006 outlook 

our future results of operations and the other forwardlooking statements contained in this filing including this mda involve a number of risks and uncertainties— in particular the statements regarding our goals and strategies new product introductions plans to cultivate new businesses future economic conditions revenue pricing gross margin and costs capital spending depreciation and amortization research and development expenses potential impairment of investments the tax rate and pending tax and legal proceedings our future results of operations may also be affected by the amount type and valuation of the sharebased awards granted as well as the amount of awards forfeited due to employee turnover in addition to the various important factors discussed above a number of other factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations see the risks described in “risk factors” in part i item 1a of this form 10k and elsewhere in this form 10k 

revenue for 2006 is expected to be 6 to 9 higher than the total in 2005 of 388 billion our financial results particularly our revenue are substantially dependent on sales of microprocessors revenue is partly a function of the mix of types and performance capabilities of microprocessors sold as well as the mix of chipsets flash memory and other semiconductor products sold all of which are difficult to forecast because of the wide price differences among mobile desktop and server microprocessors the mix of types and performance levels of microprocessors sold affects the average selling price that we will realize and has a large impact on our revenue and gross margin microprocessor revenue is also dependent on the availability of other parts of the platform including chipsets motherboards operating system software and application software revenue is also subject to demand fluctuations and the impact of economic conditions in various geographic regions 

our gross margin expectation for 2006 is 57 plus or minus a few points excluding the effects of sharebased compensation of approximately 1 our gross margin expectation for 2006 is 58 plus or minus a few points on a gaap basis the 57 midpoint is lower compared to our 2005 gross margin of 594 in addition to the recognition of sharebased compensation we will begin to recognize startup costs related to imft in 2006 we also expect higher unit costs and slightly lower average selling prices for microprocessors we expect these negative effects to our margin in 2006 to be partially offset by lower startup costs on microprocessors and chipsets 

our gross margin varies primarily with revenue levels variability of other factors will also continue to affect cost of sales and the gross margin percentage including variations in inventory valuation such as variations related to the timing of qualifying products for sale unit costs and yield issues associated with production at our factories excess or obsolete inventory timing and execution of the production ramp and associated costs including startup costs manufacturing or assembly and test capacity utilization the reusability of factory equipment impairment of longlived assets including manufacturing assembly and test and intangible assets and the valuation of stock options and other equity awards which affects the amount of sharebased compensation included in cost of sales 

we have significantly expanded our semiconductor manufacturing and assembly and test capacity over the last few years and we continue to plan capacity based on the assumed continued success of our overall strategy and the acceptance of our products in specific market segments we currently expect that capital spending in 2006 will be approximately 69 billion plus or minus 200 million compared to 58 billion in 2005 most of the projected increase will be spent on construction and capital equipment related to our nextgeneration 45nanometer process technology this capitalspending plan is dependent on expectations regarding production efficiencies and delivery times of various machinery and equipment and construction schedules if the demand for our products does not grow and continues to move toward higher performance products in the various market segments revenue and gross margin would be adversely affected manufacturing andor assembly and test capacity would be underutilized and the rate of capital spending could be reduced we could be required to record an impairment of our manufacturing or assembly and test equipment andor facilities or factory planning decisions may cause us to record accelerated depreciation however in the long term revenue and gross margin may also be affected if we do not add capacity fast enough to meet market demand

depreciation for 2006 is expected to be approximately 47 billion plus or minus 100 million compared to 43 billion in 2005 

our industry is characterized by very short product life cycles and our continued success is dependent on technological advancement including developing and implementing new processes and strategic products for specific market segments we consider it imperative to maintain a strong research and development program and our spending for research and development in 2006 is expected to be approximately 65 billion compared to 51 billion in 2005 excluding the effects of sharebased compensation of approximately 500 million spending for research and development in 2006 is expected to be approximately 60 billion 

our spending for marketing general and administrative expenses in 2006 is expected to be approximately 66 billion compared to 57 billion in 2005 excluding the effects of sharebased compensation of approximately 600 million spending for marketing general and administrative in 2006 is expected to be approximately 60 billion expenses particularly certain marketing and compensation expenses vary depending on the level of demand for our products and the level of revenue and profit 

based on acquisitions completed through february 22 2006 we expect amortization of acquisitionrelated intangibles and costs to be approximately 40 million in 2006 

at the end of 2005 we held nonmarketable equity securities with a carrying value of 561 million our nonmarketable equity securities include investments through our intel capital program the program seeks to invest in companies and businesses that can succeed and have an impact on their market segment when the strategic objectives of an investment have been achieved or if the investment or business diverges from our strategic objectives we may decide to dispose of the investment however our investments in nonmarketable equity securities are not liquid and there can be no assurance that we will be able to dispose of these investments on favorable terms or at all 

we expect our tax rate to be approximately 32 for 2006 compared to 313 in 2005 the estimated effective tax rate is based on tax law in effect at december 31 2005 and current expected income and assumes that we will continue to receive the tax benefit for export sales see “note 10 provision for taxes” and “note 18 contingencies” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k the tax rate may also be affected by the closing of acquisitions or divestitures the jurisdiction in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed changes in estimates of credits benefits and deductions including changes in the deductions related to sharebased compensation the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities and the ability to realize deferred tax assets 

we believe that we have the product offerings facilities personnel and competitive and financial resources for continued business success but future revenue costs gross margin and profits are all influenced by a number of factors including those discussed above all of which are inherently difficult to forecast 

status of business outlook 

we expect that our corporate representatives will from time to time meet privately with investors investment analysts the media and others and may reiterate the forwardlooking statements contained in the “business outlook” section and elsewhere in this form 10k including any such statements that are incorporated by reference in this form 10k at the same time we will keep this form 10k and our most current business outlook publicly available on our investor relations web site wwwintccom the public can continue to rely on the business outlook published on the web site as representing our current expectations on matters covered unless we publish a notice stating otherwise the statements in the business outlook and other forwardlooking statements in this form 10k are subject to revision during the course of the year in our quarterly earnings releases and sec filings and at other times 

from the close of business on march 3 2006 until our quarterly earnings release is published presently scheduled for april 19 2006 we will observe a “quiet period” during the quiet period the business outlook and other forwardlooking statements first published in our earnings release on january 17 2006 as reiterated or updated as applicable in this form 10k should be considered historical speaking as of prior to the quiet period only and not subject to update during the quiet period our representatives will not comment on the business outlook or our financial results or expectations the exact timing and duration of the routine quiet period and any others that we utilize from time to time may vary at our discretion 

tablestart 


 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in currency exchange rates interest rates and marketable equity security prices to mitigate these risks we may utilize derivative financial instruments among other strategies we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes all of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial positions at december 31 2005 and december 25 2004 actual results may differ materially 

currency exchange rates 

we generally hedge currency risks of nonus dollardenominated investments in debt securities with offsetting currency borrowings currency forward contracts or currency interest rate swaps gains and losses on these nonus currency investments would generally be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments resulting in negligible net exposure 

a substantial majority of our revenue expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars however we do incur certain operating costs in other currencies primarily the euro and certain other european and asian currencies to protect against reductions in value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates we have established balance sheet and forecasted transaction risk management programs currency forward contracts and currency options are generally utilized in these hedging programs our hedging programs reduce but do not always entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements we considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates of 20 for all currencies could be experienced in the near term such adverse changes after taking into account hedges and offsetting positions would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before taxes of less than 30 million at the end of 2005 and 2004 

interest rates 

the primary objective of our investments in debt securities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk to achieve this objective the returns on our investments in fixedrate debt securities are generally based on threemonth libor or if longer term are generally swapped to us dollar liborbased returns in addition to investments in 2005 we issued additional debt we considered the historical volatility of the interest rates experienced in prior years and the duration of our investment portfolio and debt issuances and determined that it was reasonably possible that an adverse change of 80 basis points 080 approximately 18 of the rate at the end of 2005 could be experienced in the near term a hypothetical 080 increase in interest rates after taking into account hedges and offsetting positions would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our net investment position of approximately 10 million and 20 million as of the end of 2005 and 2004 respectively 

marketable equity security prices 

we have a portfolio of strategic equity investments that includes marketable strategic equity securities and derivative equity instruments such as warrants and options as well as nonmarketable equity investments which are discussed further below we invest in companies that develop software hardware or services supporting our technologies these investments help advance our overall goal to be the preeminent provider of silicon chips and platform solutions to the worldwide digital economy our current investment focus areas include helping to enable mobile wireless devices advance the digital home enhance the digital enterprise advance highperformance communications infrastructures and develop the next generation of silicon production technologies our focus areas tend to develop and change over time due to rapid advancements in the technology field 

our total marketable portfolio includes marketable strategic equity securities as well as marketable equity securities classified as trading assets to the extent that our marketable portfolio of investments continues to have strategic value we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposure for securities that we no longer consider strategic we evaluate legal market and economic factors in our decision on the timing of disposal and whether it is possible and appropriate to hedge the equity market risk we may or may not enter into transactions to reduce or eliminate the market risks of our investments in strategic equity derivatives including warrants 

the marketable equity securities included in trading assets as well as certain equity derivatives are held to generate returns that generally offset changes in liabilities related to the equity market risk of certain deferred compensation arrangements the gains and losses from changes in fair value of these equity securities are generally offset by the gains and losses on the related liabilities resulting in a net exposure of less than 10 million as of both december 31 2005 and december 25 2004 assuming a reasonably possible decline in market prices of approximately 11 in the near term 

46 as of december 31 2005 the fair value of our portfolio of marketable strategic equity investments and equity derivative instruments including hedging positions was 574 million 662 million as of december 25 2004 to assess the market price sensitivity of these equity securities we analyzed the historical movements over the past several years of hightechnology stock indices that we considered appropriate however our marketable strategic equity portfolio is substantially concentrated in one company as of december 31 2005 which will affect the portfolio’s price volatility we currently have an investment in micron with a fair value of 451 million or 79 of the total marketable strategic equity portfolio value including equity derivative instruments at december 31 2005 during 2005 we recognized an impairment charge of 105 million related to our investment in micron reflecting the difference between the cost basis of the investment and the price of micron’s stock at the end of the second quarter the impairment was principally based on our assessment during the second quarter of 2005 of micron’s financial results and the fact that the market price of micron’s stock had been below our cost basis for an extended period of time as well as the competitive pricing environment for dram products the investment in micron is part of our strategy to support the development and supply of dram products based on the analysis of the hightechnology stock indices and the historical volatility of micron’s stock we estimated that it was reasonably possible that the prices of the stocks in our marketable strategic equity portfolio could experience a loss of 40 in the near term 45 as of the end of 2004 the assumed loss percentage used in 2005 was lower than the assumed loss percentage in 2004 due to the differences in the concentrations of investments at the end of each year this estimate is not necessarily indicative of future performance and actual results may differ materially 

assuming a loss of 40 in market prices and after reflecting the impact of hedges and offsetting positions our marketable strategic equity portfolio could decrease in value by approximately 245 million based on the value of the portfolio as of december 31 2005 a decrease in value of approximately 300 million based on the value of the portfolio as of december 25 2004 using an assumed loss of 45 at december 25 2004 our marketable strategic equity portfolio was substantially concentrated in two companies the fair value of our investment in micron was approximately 400 million or 60 of the total marketable portfolio value including equity derivative instruments at december 25 2004 in addition the fair value of our investment in elpida memory inc was approximately 212 million or 32 of the portfolio at december 25 2004 we sold our investment in elpida during 2005 

nonmarketable equity securities 

our strategic investments in nonmarketable equity securities are affected by many of the same factors that could result in an adverse movement of equity market prices although the impact cannot be directly quantified such a movement and the underlying economic conditions would negatively affect the prospects of the companies we invest in their ability to raise additional capital and the likelihood of our being able to realize our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings mergers or private sales these types of investments involve a great deal of risk and there can be no assurance that any specific company will grow or become successful consequently we could lose all or part of our investment at december 31 2005 our strategic investments in nonmarketable equity securities had a carrying amount of 561 million 507 million as of december 25 2004 the carrying amount of these investments approximated fair value as of december 31 2005 and december 24 2004 no investment in our nonmarketable equity securities portfolio was individually significant as of december 31 2005 or december 25 2004

the evaluation of our disclosure controls included a review of the controls’ objectives and design the company’s implementation of the controls and their effect on the information generated for use in this form 10k in the course of the controls evaluation we reviewed identified data errors control problems or acts of fraud and sought to confirm that appropriate corrective actions including process improvements were being undertaken this type of evaluation is performed on a quarterly basis so that the conclusions of management including the ceo and cfo concerning the effectiveness of the disclosure controls can be reported in our periodic reports on form 10q and form 10k many of the components of our disclosure controls are also evaluated on an ongoing basis by our internal audit department and by other personnel in our finance and enterprise services organization the overall goals of these various evaluation activities are to monitor our disclosure controls and to modify them as necessary our intent is to maintain the disclosure controls as dynamic systems that change as conditions warrant 

based upon the controls evaluation our ceo and cfo have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this form 10k our disclosure controls were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our exchange act reports is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the sec and that material information related to intel and its consolidated subsidiaries is made known to management including the ceo and cfo particularly during the period when our periodic reports are being prepared 

management report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

84 management assessed our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2005 the end of our fiscal year management based its assessment on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission management’s assessment included evaluation of such elements as the design and operating effectiveness of key financial reporting controls process documentation accounting policies and our overall control environment this assessment is supported by testing and monitoring performed by both our internal audit organization and our finance and enterprise services organization 

based on our assessment management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the fiscal year to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles we reviewed the results of management’s assessment with the audit committee of our board of directors in addition on a quarterly basis we evaluate any changes to our internal control over financial reporting to determine if material changes occurred 

our independent registered public accounting firm ernst  young llp audited management’s assessment and independently assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting ernst  young has issued an attestation report concurring with management’s assessment which is included at the end of part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

the company’s management including the ceo and cfo does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures

products 

  

our products include microprocessors chipsets motherboards flash memory communications infrastructure components including network and embedded processors wired and wireless connectivity products products for networked storage application processors and cellular baseband chipsets 

  

our customers include 

  

   

   

   

our primary focus is on developing advanced integrated silicon technology solutions which we believe will provide the performance necessary to help accelerate the convergence of computing and communications capabilities with digital content convergence refers to having computing and communications capabilities in an integrated product solution we also provide key components for the networking and communications infrastructure used to connect technology users 

  

we believe that users of computing and communications devices want improved performance which includes faster processor performance andor improved capabilities such as multithreading or multitasking lower system power consumption seamless connectivity improved security reliability ease of use and interoperability among devices our goal is to incorporate features addressing these capabilities into our various products to meet user demands we believe that our customers who build computing and communications systems and devices will benefit if our products incorporating these capabilities are based on a platform solution we define a platform as a collection of silicon components and software designed to provide a better user solution when used in combination than if used separately 

  

for 2004 the company consisted of two productline operating segments the intel architecture business and the intel communications group icg both of our operating segments use their core competencies in the design and manufacture of integrated circuits as well as key silicon and platform capabilities to provide building blocks for technology solutions the intel architecture business provides advanced technologies to support the desktop mobile and enterprise computing market segments icg offers products such as flash memory as well as platform solutions for the wireless handheld computing and communications market segments in addition icg offers wired and wireless connectivity products and key networking and communications infrastructure components in 2004 we combined our communicationsrelated businesses into a single organization icg previously these communications businesses were in two separate productline operating segments the former intel communications group and the wireless communications and computing group 

  

in january 2005 we announced a planned reorganization of our business groups to bring all major product groups in line with the company’s strategy to drive development of complete technology platforms these new business units include the mobility group the digital enterprise group the digital home group the digital health group and the channel platforms group we expect this reorganization to become effective in 2005 because the reporting period for this form 10k is as of december 25 2004 the business groups discussed below and the results of operations for our operating segments in this filing are presented under the organizational structure that existed as of december 25 2004 

  

intel architecture business 

  

the intel architecture business develops platform solutions based on our microprocessors chipsets and motherboard products which we optimize for use in the desktop mobile or server computing market segments the enduser products into which our products are ultimately integrated are determined by our customers based on how they choose to meet specific user requirements 

  

net revenue for the intel architecture operating segment made up approximately 85 of our consolidated net revenue in 2004 revenue from sales of microprocessors within the intel architecture operating segment represented approximately 72 of consolidated net revenue in 2004 our microprocessor business generally has followed a seasonal trend however there can be no assurance that this trend will continue for the past five years the company’s sales of microprocessors were higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year consumer purchases of pcs have been higher in the second half of the year primarily due to backtoschool and holiday demand in addition technology purchases from businesses have tended to be higher in the second half of the year 

  

a microprocessor is the central processing unit cpu of a computer system it processes system data and controls other devices in the system acting as the “brains” of the computer one indicator of microprocessor performance is its clock speed the rate at which its internal logic operates which is measured in units of hertz or cycles processed per second one megahertz mhz equals one million cycles processed per second and one gigahertz ghz equals one billion cycles processed per second as computers continue to support increased usage models other factors are becoming increasingly important to overall system performance examples include the amount of memory storage the speed of memory access the microarchitecture design of the cpu and the speed of communication between the cpu and the chipset a faster bus for example allows for faster data transfer into and out of the processor enabling increased performance a bus carries data between parts of the system a common way to categorize microprocessor design architectures is by the number of bits the smallest unit of information on a machine that the processor can handle at one time microprocessors currently are designed to process 32 bits or 64 bits of information at one time microprocessors with 64bit addressing capability can address significantly more memory than 32bit microprocessors the intel ® pentium ®  intel ® celeron ® and intel ® xeon ™ branded products are based on our 32bit architecture ia32 while intel ® itanium ® branded products are based on 64bit architecture another way to provide 64bit processing capability is for processors based on 32bit architecture to have 64bit address extensions certain of our pentium ® 4 and intel xeon products have 64bit address extensions the memory stored on a chip is measured in bytes 8 bits with 1024 bytes equaling a kilobyte kb 1049 million bytes equaling a megabyte mb and 1074 billion bytes equaling a gigabyte gb cache is a memory that can be located directly on the microprocessor permitting quicker access to frequently used data and instructions some of our microprocessors have additional levels of cache secondlevel l2 cache and thirdlevel l3 cache to offer higher levels of performance 

  

other microprocessor capabilities can also enhance system performance or user experience by running software more efficiently for example we currently offer microprocessors with intel’s hyperthreading technology ht technology which allows a single processor to process two sets of instructions simultaneously this capability can provide benefits in one of two ways it helps to run “multithreaded” software which is designed to execute different parts of a program simultaneously or helps to use multiple software programs simultaneously in a multitasking environment to take advantage of ht technology a computer system must have a microprocessor that supports the technology a chipset and bios basic inputoutput system that use the technology and an operating system that includes optimizations for the technology performance will vary depending on the system hardware and software used 

  

intel began using a new naming convention for its desktop and mobile microprocessors in the second quarter of 2004 in an effort to better convey the overall feature set of a processor beyond just clock speed intel desktop and mobile processor brand names are now accompanied by 3digit processor numbers that represent the technical features of the product including design architecture clock speed cache size bus speed and other technologies over time we expect that these processor numbers will allow end customers to more easily distinguish among individual processors by taking into account a broader set of features that contribute to the overall user experience currently the new processor numbers begin with a 3 5 6 or 7 according to the processor family to which they belong those beginning with a 3 belong to the intel celeron processor family those beginning with a 5 or 6 belong to the intel pentium 4 processor family and those beginning with a 7 belong to the intel ® pentium ® m processor family in january 2005 we began shipping our 600 sequence processor numbers that start with a 6 pentium 4 processors featuring 2 mb of cache memory 

  

the chipset operates as the pc’s “nervous system”—sending data from the processor to input display and storage devices such as the keyboard mouse monitor hard drive and cd or dvd drive chipsets perform essential logic functions such as balancing the performance of the system and removing bottlenecks chipsets also extend the graphics audio video and other capabilities of many systems based on our processors finally chipsets control the access between the cpu and main memory we offer chipsets compatible with a variety of industryaccepted bus specifications such as the accelerated graphics port agp specification the peripheral components interconnect pci local bus specification and the new pci express local bus specification pci express significantly increases the data transfer rate of the original pci specification thereby improving the graphics and inputoutput bandwidth and enabling an improved multimedia experience for the digital home our customers also want memory architecture alternatives and as a result we currently offer chipsets supporting double data rate ddr and ddr2 secondgeneration faster ddr memory dynamic random access memory dram and synchronous dram sdram 

  

a motherboard is the principal board within a system that has connectors for attaching devices to the bus typically the motherboard contains the cpu memory and the chipset we offer motherboard products designed for our microprocessors and chipsets thereby offering a more complete range of solutions for customers looking for intel architecturebased solutions boardlevel products give our oem customers flexibility by enabling them to buy at the board level rather than only at the component level

wired and wireless connectivity products 

  

ethernet is an industrystandard technology used to translate and transmit data in packets across networks as ethernet has expanded from the traditional local area network lan environment into the wireless lan wlan metropolitan area network man and networked storage market segments we have expanded our product portfolio to address these other market segments for the man market segment we offer products at multiple levels of integration to provide a lowcost solution with increased speed and signal transmission distance commonly referred to as “reach” gigabit ethernet networks allow the transmission of one billion individual bits of information per second and 10gigabit ethernet networks transmit 10 billion bits of information per second by contrast fast ethernet networks transmit 100 million bits of information per second mbps or megabits per second 

  

in may 2004 we introduced a 10gigabit ethernet adapter for servers the intel ® pro10gbe sr server adapter designed to lower the costs of setting up a scalable networked data center 

  

in january 2004 we introduced the intel prowireless 2200bg network connection a dualmode product supporting the 80211b and 80211g forms of wifi in august 2004 we introduced the intel ® prowireless 2915abg network connection which supports all three current forms of wifi 80211a b and g support for these three wireless technologies enables notebook pcs based on intel centrino mobile technology to establish wireless connections with all currently available wifi network types 

  

networked storage 

  

in the networked storage market segment we offer products that allow storage resources to be added in either of the two most prevalent types of storage networks ethernet or fibre channel 

  

manufacturing and assembly and test 

  

as of yearend 2004 nearly 70 of our wafer manufacturing including microprocessor chipset flash memory and communications silicon fabrication was conducted within the us at our facilities in new mexico oregon arizona massachusetts california and colorado outside the us more than 30 of our wafer manufacturing including wafer fabrication for microprocessors chipsets flash memory and networking silicon was conducted at our facilities in ireland and israel 

  

as of december 2004 we manufactured our products in the wafer fabrication facilities described in the following table 

  

   

in 2004 we continued to transition our microprocessor manufacturing from 200mm 8inch wafers to 300mm 12inch wafers as of yearend 2004 the majority of our microprocessors were manufactured on 300mm wafers the conversion to 300mm wafers allows for more efficient use of our capital investment in equipment by providing more than twice as many equivalent chips per wafer as 200mm wafers we currently expect two additional facilities to begin wafer fabrication on 300mm wafers in the second half of 2005 or the first half of 2006 

  

as of yearend 2004 the majority of our microprocessors were manufactured using our 90nanometer process technology the 90nanometer process technology is our most advanced highvolume production process featuring structures smaller than the size of a virus the world’s smallest microorganism as we move to each succeeding generation of manufacturing process technology we incur significant startup costs to get each factory ready for highvolume manufacturing however continuing to advance our process technology provides added benefits that we believe justify these costs these benefits can include utilizing less space per transistor which enables us to put more transistors on an equivalent size chip decreasing the size of the chip or allowing us to offer an increased number of integrated features these advancements can result in higher performing microprocessors products that consume less power andor products that cost less to manufacture to augment capacity in the us and internationally we use subcontractors foundries to manufacture wafers for certain components including networking and communications products 

  

we primarily use subcontractors to manufacture boardlevel products and systems and purchase certain communications networking products from external vendors primarily in the asiapacific region we also manufacture microprocessor and networkingrelated boardlevel products primarily in malaysia 

  

following manufacture the majority of our components are subject to assembly in several types of packaging and to testing we perform a substantial majority of our components assembly and test at facilities in malaysia the philippines china and costa rica we plan to continue to invest in new assembly and test technologies and facilities to keep pace with our microprocessor chipset flash memory and communications technology improvements to augment capacity we use subcontractors to perform assembly of certain products primarily flash memory chipsets and networking and communications products our performance expectations for business integrity ethics and environmental health and safety compliance are the same regardless of whether our supplier and subcontractor operations are based in the us or elsewhere our employment practices are consistent with and we expect our suppliers and subcontractors to abide by local country law in addition we impose a minimum employee age requirement regardless of local law 

  

we have thousands of suppliers including subcontractors providing our various materials and service needs we set expectations for supplier performance and reinforce those expectations with periodic assessments we communicate those expectations to our suppliers regularly and work with them to implement improvements when necessary we seek where possible to have several sources of supply for all of these materials and resources but we may rely on a single or limited number of suppliers or upon suppliers in a single country in those cases we develop and implement plans and actions to reduce the exposure that would result from a disruption in supply 

  

our products typically are produced at multiple intel facilities at various sites around the world or by subcontractors who have multiple facilities however some products are produced in only one intel or subcontractor facility and we seek to implement actions and plans to reduce the exposure that would result from a disruption at any such facility 

  

manufacturing and assembly and test of integrated circuits is a complex process normal risks include errors and interruptions in the production process defects in raw materials and disruptions at supplier locations as well as other risks all of which can affect the timing of the production ramps and yields a substantial decrease in yields would result in higher costs and the possibility of not being able to produce sufficient volume to meet specific product demand a substantial increase in yields could result in higher inventory levels and the possibility of resulting excess capacity charges as we slow production to reduce inventory levels in addition higher yields as well as other factors can decrease overall unit costs and may cause us to revalue our existing inventory on certain products to their lower replacement cost which would impact our gross margin in the quarters in which this revaluation occurs 

  

we operate globally with sales offices and research and development manufacturing and assembly and test facilities in many countries and as a result we are subject to risks and factors associated with doing business outside the us global operations involve inherent risks that include currency controls and fluctuations tariff and import regulations and regulatory requirements that may limit our or our customers’ ability to manufacture assemble and test design develop or sell products in particular countries as part of our siteselection due diligence processes we assess several criteria which include the property’s physical characteristics or constructability local utility infrastructure transportation capability availability of technical workforce construction and supplier capabilities permitting requirements and investment conditions employment practices and labor rights issues are incorporated in the diligence evaluations also include ratings for security concerns which include corruption terrorism crime and political instability security concerns alone are sufficient to remove projects from consideration regardless of these efforts if terrorist activity armed conflict civil or military unrest or political instability occurs in the us israel or other locations such events may disrupt production logistics security and communications and could also result in reduced demand for intel’s products the impacts of major health concerns or possible infrastructure disruptions such as largescale outages or interruptions of service from utilities or telecommunications providers on intel its suppliers customers or other third parties could also adversely affect our business and impact customer order patterns business continuity could also be affected if labor issues disrupt our transportation arrangements or those of our customers or suppliers on a worldwide basis we regularly review our key infrastructure systems services and suppliers both internally and externally to seek to identify significant vulnerabilities as well as areas of potential business impact if a disruptive event were to occur once identified we assess the risks and as we consider them to be appropriate we initiate actions intended to reduce the risks and their potential impact however there can be no assurance that we have identified all significant risks or that we can mitigate all identified risks with reasonable effort 

  

we maintain a program of insurance coverage for various types of property casualty and other risks we place our insurance coverage with various carriers in numerous jurisdictions the policies are subject to deductibles and exclusions that result in our retention of a level of risk on a selfinsurance basis the types and amounts of insurance obtained vary from time to time and from location to location depending on availability cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention our worldwide risk and insurance programs are regularly evaluated to seek to obtain the most favorable terms and conditions

research and development 

  

we remain committed to investing in worldclass technology development particularly in the area of the design and manufacture of integrated circuits our research and development rd activities are directed toward developing the technology innovations primarily at the silicon level that we believe will deliver the next generation of usage models and products in particular we are focused on advanced computing communications and wireless technologies our rd activities in these areas are increasingly centered around platforms in addition we continue to invest in new manufacturing packaging and testing processes as well as improving existing products and reducing costs we believe that we are well positioned in the technology industry to help drive innovation foster collaboration and promote industry standards that will yield innovative and improved technologies for users 

  

our rd model is based on a global decentralized organization that emphasizes a collaborative approach in identifying and developing new technologies leading standards initiatives and influencing regulatory policy to accelerate the adoption of new technologies our rd initiatives are performed by various business groups within the company and we align and prioritize these initiatives across these business groups we also work with a worldwide network of academic and industry researchers scientists and engineers in the computing and communications fields a decentralized network of technology professionals allows us as well as others in our industry to benefit from development initiatives in a variety of areas eventually leading to innovative technologies for users 

  

we perform a substantial majority of our design and development of semiconductor components and other products in the us outside the us we have been increasing our product development and we have activities at various locations including israel india malaysia china and russia we also maintain rd facilities in the us that are focused on developing and improving manufacturing processes as well as facilities in the us malaysia and the philippines that are dedicated to improvements in assembly and test processes 

  

we are focusing our rd efforts on delivering the next generation of microprocessors and on the advancement of our manufacturing process technology future generations of our microprocessors are expected to feature two or more processor cores on a single chip rather than just one microprocessor core these dual and multicore processors are expected to complement our efforts to enable more capabilities performance and flexibility for users beyond processor speed our leadership in silicon technology has allowed us to continue to deliver on the promise of “moore’s law” doubling the number of transistors on a chip every couple of years and also to help expand moore’s law by bringing new capabilities into silicon and producing new products optimized for a wider variety of applications we are currently manufacturing the majority of our microprocessors using 90nanometer process technology our 65nanometer process technology is currently in development and we expect to begin manufacturing products using 65nanometer process technology in 2005 we are also working to increase the size of the cache memory in our microprocessor products larger cache memory allows for faster system performance at equivalent processor speeds by allowing faster data retrieval for applications that can effectively use additional cache memory 

  

in addition we believe that system security and reliability features at the hardware level will facilitate an enhanced computing experience for users and we are working to provide these capabilities in future products in line with these efforts in january 2005 we announced that we are accelerating the introduction of our technology codenamed “vanderpool” for desktop platforms vanderpool is a virtualization technology that allows a platform to run multiple operating systems and applications in independent partitions and will complement our upcoming introduction of dualcore processors later in 2005 to take advantage of the benefits of vanderpool a computer system must have a microprocessor that supports the technology a chipset and bios that use the technology an operating system that includes optimizations for the technology and software applications enabled for the technology some of these other features and applications are currently being developed by third parties 

  

we also have rd initiatives in the wireless networking and communications product areas our communications initiatives are focused on delivering the technologies that will enable an advanced wireless platform including 80216 products wimax wimax is a wireless broadband access technology that is expected to enable broadband wireless access as an alternative to existing “last mile” methods such as cable and digital subscriber lines dsl 

  

we do not expect that all of our product development projects will result in products that are ultimately released for sale we may terminate product development before completion or decide not to manufacture and sell a developed product for a variety of reasons for example we may decide that a product might not be sufficiently competitive in the relevant market segment or for technological or marketing reasons we may decide to offer a different product instead 

  

our expenditures for rd were 48 billion in fiscal 2004 44 billion in fiscal 2003 and 40 billion in fiscal 2002 we increased the number of our employees engaged in rd to approximately 25000 in december 2004 compared to approximately 23000 in december 2003 

  

employees 

  

as of december 25 2004 we employed approximately 85000 people worldwide with approximately 60 of these employees located in the us 

  

sales and marketing 

  

most of our products are sold or licensed through sales offices located near major concentrations of users throughout the americas europe asiapacific and japan our business relies on continued sales growth in emerging markets and continued business and consumer investment in technologies that use our products in mature markets 

  

sales agreements typically contain standard terms and conditions covering matters such as pricing payment terms and warranties as well as indemnities for issues specific to our products such as patent and copyright indemnities from time to time we may enter into additional agreements with customers covering for example changes from our standard terms and conditions new product development and marketing privatelabel branding and other matters sales of particular products are generally conducted with purchase orders issued under the sales agreements most of intel’s sales are made using electronic and webbased processes that allow the customer to review inventory availability and to track the progress of specific goods under order pricing on particular products may vary based on volumes ordered and other factors 

  

we sell our products to oems and odms odms provide design andor manufacturing services to branded and unbranded privatelabel resellers we also sell our products to industrial and retail distributors in 2004 dell inc accounted for approximately 19 of our total sales and hewlettpackard company accounted for approximately 16 of our total sales a substantial majority of the sales to these customers consisted of products from our intel architecture business no other customer accounted for more than 10 of our total revenue for information about revenue and operating profit by operating segments and revenue from unaffiliated customers by geographic regioncountry see “note 19 operating segment and geographic information” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in part ii item 7 of this form 10k 

  

typically distributors handle a wide variety of products including those that compete with our products and fill orders for many customers most of our sales to distributors are made under agreements allowing for price protection on unsold merchandise and a right of return on stipulated quantities of unsold merchandise we also utilize thirdparty sales representatives who generally do not offer directly competitive products but may carry complementary items manufactured by others sales representatives do not maintain a product inventory instead their customers place orders directly with us or through distributors 

  

our worldwide reseller sales channel consists of thousands of indirect customers who are systems builders and purchase intel microprocessors and other products from our distributors these systems builders receive various levels of technical and marketing services and support directly from intel we have a “boxed processor program” that allows distributors to sell intel microprocessors in small quantities to these systemsbuilder customers boxed processors are also made available in direct retail outlets 

  

our global marketing strategy is designed to associate our brands with advanced technology and innovation the intel ® brand is intended to represent technology leadership innovation quality and reliability our product brands include itanium intel xeon pentium celeron and intel centrino which are all part of our ingredient brand family we promote brand awareness and generate demand through our own direct marketing as well as comarketing programs our direct marketing activities include television print and webbased advertising as well as press relations consumer and trade events and industry and consumer communications currently our direct marketing to the consumer focuses on the digital home and building awareness and demand for new usage models and capabilities our marketing directed toward businesses focuses on our continuing to deliver technologies designed for performance and reliability to enterprise and small to midsize businesses 

  

purchases by customers often allow them to participate in cooperative advertising and marketing programs such as the intel inside ® program through the intel inside program certain customers are licensed to place intel inside logos on computers containing our microprocessors and our other technology and to use our brands in advertisements the program includes a market development component that accrues funds based on purchases and partially reimburses the oems for advertisements for products featuring the intel inside brand subject to the oems meeting defined criteria this program broadens the reach of our brands beyond the scope of our own direct advertising additionally our reseller sales channel marketing programs are intended to extend the intel inside brand reach to channel customers and the businesses and individuals that purchase computer systems from them 

  

our products are typically shipped under terms that transfer title to the customer even in arrangements for which the recognition of revenue on the sale is deferred the sales agreements typically provide that payment is due at a later date generally 30 days after shipment delivery or the customer’s use of the product our credit department sets accounts receivable and shipping limits for individual customers for the purpose of controlling credit risk to intel arising from outstanding account balances we assess credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis and from this analysis we establish credit limits and determine whether we will seek to use one or more credit support devices such as obtaining some form of thirdparty guaranty or standby letter of credit or obtaining credit insurance for all or a portion of the account balance credit losses may still be incurred due to bankruptcy fraud or other failure 

  

of the customer to pay see “schedule ii—valuation and qualifying accounts” on page 85 of this form 10k for information about our allowance for doubtful receivables 

  

backlog 

  

we do not believe that a backlog as of any particular date is indicative of future results our sales are made primarily pursuant to standard purchase orders for delivery of standard products we have some agreements that give a customer the right to purchase a specific number of products during a specified time period although these agreements do not generally obligate the customer to purchase any particular number of such products some of these agreements do contain billback clauses under these clauses customers who do not purchase the full volume agreed upon are liable for billback on previous shipments up to the price appropriate for the quantity actually purchased as a matter of industry practice billback clauses are difficult to enforce the quantities actually purchased by the customer as well as the shipment schedules are frequently revised during the agreement term to reflect changes in the customer’s needs in light of industry practice and our experience we do not believe that such agreements are meaningful for determining backlog amounts we believe that only a small portion of our order backlog is noncancelable and that the dollar amount associated with the noncancelable portion is not significant 

  

competition 

  

as part of our overall strategy to compete in each relevant market segment we use our core competencies in the design and manufacture of integrated circuits and our financial resources global presence and brand recognition also under our intel capital program we make equity investments in companies around the world to further our strategic objectives and support our key business initiatives our products compete to varying degrees on the basis of performance which includes features that can enhance the user experience quality brand recognition price and availability our ability to compete also depends on our ability to provide innovative platform solutions and worldwide support for our customers 

  

the semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid advances in technology and new product introductions as unit volumes grow production experience is accumulated and costs decrease further competition develops and as a result prices decline the life cycle of our products is very short sometimes less than a year our ability to compete depends on our ability to improve our products and processes faster than our competitors anticipate changing customer requirements and develop and launch new products while reducing our costs when we believe it is appropriate we will take various steps including introducing new products and platform solutions discontinuing older products reducing prices and offering rebates and other incentives to increase acceptance of our latest products and to be competitive within each relevant market segment our products compete with products developed for similar or rival architectures and with products based on the same or rival technology standards we cannot predict which competing technology standards will become the prevailing standards in the market segments in which we compete 

  

many companies compete with us in the various computing networking and communications market segments and are engaged in the same basic fields of activity including research and development worldwide these competitors range in size from large established multinational companies with multiple product lines to smaller companies and new entrants to the marketplace that compete in specialized market segments in some cases our competitors are also our customers andor suppliers with the convergence in computing and communications products product offerings will continue to cross over into multiple categories offering us new opportunities but also resulting in more competition in markets where our competitors have established products and brand recognition it may be inherently difficult for us to compete against them 

  

most of our products including all of our intel architecture microprocessors and chipsets as well as our flash memory and embedded processors within icg are built in our own manufacturing facilities we believe that our network of manufacturing facilities and assembly and test facilities gives us a competitive advantage this network enables us to have more direct control over our processes quality control product cost volume and timing of production and other factors these types of facilities are very expensive and many of our competitors do not own such facilities because they cannot afford to do so or because their business models involve the use of thirdparty facilities for manufacturing and assembly and test these “fabless semiconductor companies” include broadcom corporation nvidia corporation qualcomm incorporated and via technologies inc some of our competitors own portions of such facilities through investment or jointventure arrangements with other companies there is a group of thirdparty manufacturing companies foundries and assembly and test subcontractors that offer their services to companies without owned facilities or companies needing additional capacity these foundries and subcontractors may also offer to our competitors intellectual property design services and other goods and services competitors who outsource their manufacturing and assembly and test operations can significantly reduce their capital expenditures 

  

we plan to continue to cultivate new businesses and work with the computing and communications industries through standards bodies trade associations oems odms and independent software and operating system vendors to align the industry to offer products that take advantage of the latest market trends and usage models these efforts include helping to create the infrastructure for wireless network connectivity we are also working with these industries to develop software applications and operating systems that take advantage of our microprocessors chipsets and other nextgeneration semiconductor devices with higher performance we frequently participate in industry initiatives designed to discuss and agree upon technical specifications and other aspects of technologies that could be adopted as standards by standardssetting organizations our competitors may also participate in the same initiatives and our participation does not ensure that any standards or specifications adopted by these organizations will be consistent with our product planning 

  

companies in the semiconductor industry often rely on the ability to license patents from each other in order to compete in today’s markets many of our competitors have broad crosslicenses or licenses with us and under current case law some such licenses may permit these competitors to pass our patent rights on to others if one of these licensees becomes a foundry our competitors might be able to avoid our patent rights in manufacturing competing products in addition to licensing our patents to competitors our participation in industry initiatives may require us to license our patents to other companies that adopt certain industry standards or specifications even when such organizations do not adopt standards or specifications proposed by intel any intel patents implicated by our participation in such initiatives might not in some situations be available for us to enforce against others who might be infringing those patents we cannot be assured that the patents and licenses on our products will be honored in all regions in which we compete in various geographies where our business is growing we have no assurance about the scope of rights that we can enforce against others or that others may assert against us in addition in certain regions governments may adopt regulations or courts may render decisions requiring compulsory licensing of intellectual property to others or requiring that products meet specified standards that serve to favor local companies negatively impacting intel’s ability to achieve an economic return for its innovation and investment 

  

intel architecture business 

  

we continue to be largely dependent on the success of our microprocessor business many of our competitors including advanced micro devices inc amd our primary microprocessor competitor market softwarecompatible products that are intended to compete with intel architecturebased processors we also face competition from companies offering rival microprocessor designs such as international business machines corporation ibm which supplies microprocessors to apple computer inc ibm is also jointly developing a rival architecture design with sony corporation and toshiba corporation we currently offer desktop mobile and server microprocessor products based on our 32bit architecture enterpriseclass servers and supercomputing product offerings based on 64bit architecture and workstation and server solutions based on the ia32 architecture with 64bit extension technology that are able to run both 32bit and 64bit software applications amd offers competing microprocessor product offerings for servers workstations and desktops that are able to run existing 32bit and 64bit software applications we continuously evaluate all of our product offerings and the timing of their introduction taking into account factors such as customer requirements availability of infrastructure to take advantage of product performance and maturity of applications software for each type of processor in the relevant market segments 

  

our desktop processors compete with products offered by amd ibm and via among others our mobile microprocessor products compete with products offered by amd ibm transmeta corporation and via among others our server processors compete with softwarecompatible products offered by amd and with products based on rival architectures including those offered by hewlettpackard company ibm and sun microsystems inc our chipsets compete in the various market segments against different types of chipsets that support either our microprocessor products or rival microprocessor products competing chipsets are produced by companies such as ati technologies inc broadcom nvidia silicon integrated systems corporation sis and via we also compete with companies offering graphics components and other specialpurpose products used in the desktop mobile and server market segments one aspect of our business model is to incorporate higher performance and advanced properties into the microprocessor and chipset the demand for which may increasingly be affected by competition from companies such as ati and nvidia whose business models are based on incorporating performance into chipsets and other components such as graphics controllers 

  

intel communications group 

  

within icg we are focused on developing componentlevel products for the wireless handheld computing and communications market segments we also are developing products that we believe will help continue to build out the internet 

  

componentlevel products for the wireless handheld computing and communications market segments include flash memory products application processors and cellular baseband chipsets in our various market segments our products currently compete with the products of other companies such as qualcomm samsung electronics co ltd spansion llc a subsidiary of amd stmicroelectronics nv and texas instruments incorporated the megabit demand of the products that make use of flash memory is increasing and our nor flash memory products face increased competition from companies that manufacture nand flash memory products as oems look for opportunities to use nand flash memory products with additional random access memory or in combination with nor flash memory for executablecode applications various digital cellular technologies are used throughout the cellular communications industry including but not limited to gsm global system for mobile communications gprs general packet radio service cdma code division multiple access and wcdma wideband cdma our ability to compete successfully with our cellular baseband chipsets is dependent on having products available for the most prevalent or widely adopted digital cellular technology our current product offerings are for use in cell phones and pdas that incorporate the gsmgprs cellular technologies our products planned for release in 2005 will be targeted for the wcdma as well as gsmgprs cellular technologies 

  

in support of the buildout of the internet we offer products designed for wired and wireless connectivity for the communications infrastructure including network and embedded processors and for networked storage in these areas we face competition from both established and emerging companies our products currently compete against offerings from companies such as applied micro circuits corporation atheros communications broadcom freescale semiconductor inc ibm marvell technology group ltd and texas instruments we cannot predict whether our networking and communications products will continue to compete successfully with those of our existing competitors or new market entrants 

  

acquisitions and strategic investments 

  

our level of new acquisition and strategic investment activity for 2004 and 2003 was substantially lower than in prior years during 2004 we completed one acquisition for net cash consideration of approximately 33 million plus certain liabilities in addition we entered into certain arrangements in 2004 related to the hiring of a group of employees that resulted in the recording of workforceinplace of 28 million in other acquisitionrelated intangibles within other assets on our balance sheet 

  

under our intel capital program we make equity investments in companies around the world to further our strategic objectives and support our key business initiatives the intel capital program generally focuses on investing in companies and initiatives to stimulate growth in the digital economy create new business opportunities for intel and expand global markets for our products the investments may support among other things intel product initiatives emerging trends in the technology industry or worldwide internet deployment this strategic investment program helps advance our overall mission to be the preeminent supplier of building blocks to the worldwide digital economy many of our investments are in private companies including developmentstage companies with little or no revenue from current product offerings 

  

we invest in companies that develop software hardware or services supporting our technologies our current investment focus areas include enabling mobile wireless devices helping to advance the digital home enhancing the digital enterprise advancing highperformance communications infrastructures and developing the next generation of silicon production technologies our focus areas tend to develop and change over time due to rapid advancements in technology 

  

intellectual property and licensing 

  

intellectual property rights that apply to our various products and services include patents copyrights trade secrets trademarks and maskwork rights we maintain an active program to protect our investment in technology by attempting to ensure respect for our intellectual property rights the extent of the legal protection given to different types of intellectual property rights varies under different countries’ legal systems we intend to license our intellectual property rights where we can obtain adequate consideration see “competition” in part i item 1 of this form 10k 

  

we have filed and obtained a number of patents in the us and abroad while our patents are an important element of our success our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any one patent we and other companies in the computing telecommunications and related hightechnology fields typically apply for and receive in the aggregate tens of thousands of patents annually in the us and other countries we believe that the duration of the applicable patents we are granted is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products because of the fast pace of innovation and product development our products are often obsolete before the patents related to them expire and sometimes are obsolete before the patents related to them are even granted as we expand our product offerings into new industries such as consumer electronics we also seek to extend our patent development efforts to patent such product offerings established competitors in these industries and companies that purchase and enforce patents and other intellectual property may already have patents covering similar products there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain patents covering our own products or that we will be able to obtain licenses from such companies on favorable terms or at all 

  

much of the software we distribute including software embedded in our component and systemlevel products is entitled to copyright protection under some circumstances we may require our customers to obtain a software license before we provide them with that software 

  

to distinguish genuine intel products from our competitors’ products we have obtained certain trademarks and trade names for our products and we maintain cooperative advertising programs with certain customers to promote our brands and identify products containing genuine intel components 

  

we also protect certain details about our processes products and strategies as trade secrets keeping confidential the information that we believe provides us with a competitive advantage we have ongoing programs designed to maintain the confidentiality of such information 

  

our ability to enforce our patents copyrights software licenses and other intellectual property is subject to general litigation risks as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of various intellectual property rights in various countries when we seek to enforce our rights we are often subject to claims that the intellectual property right is invalid is otherwise not enforceable or is licensed to the party against whom we are asserting a claim in addition our assertion of intellectual property rights often results in the other party seeking to assert alleged intellectual property rights of its own against us like many companies in the semiconductor and other hightechnology industries we receive claims that we may be infringing others’ intellectual property rights from competitors and companies that purchase and enforce patents and other intellectual property in addition our sales agreements often include intellectual property indemnities such as patent and copyright indemnities and our customers may assert claims against us for indemnity when they receive claims alleging that our customers’ products infringe others’ intellectual property rights when we receive such claims we refer them to our legal counsel and current claims are in various stages of evaluation and negotiation if we determine that it is necessary or desirable we may seek licenses for certain intellectual property rights however we can give no assurance that we will be able to obtain licenses from any claimant or that we can accept the terms of any offered licenses further we are not able to resolve every dispute without litigation which is typically timeconsuming and expensive if we are not ultimately successful in defending ourselves against these claims in litigation we may not be able to sell a particular product or family of products due to an injunction or we may have to pay material amounts of damages see “legal proceedings” in part i item 3 of this form 10k

all intel desktop processors produced in 2004 were capable of taking advantage of the advanced energysaving features of the instantly available pc platform which makes it possible to have a highperformance featurerich pc that is power efficient when both active and idle and remains connected to a network even when powered off similarly the intel pentium m processor and intel centrino mobile technology processors were designed specifically for notebook performance and include a variety of energysaving features such as 

  

   

   

   

intel has also moved to improve the energy efficiency of desktop system power supplies by issuing new energyefficiency targets as part of our power supply design guidelines power supply efficiencies for desktop computers improved in 2004 we worked with industry peers and the us environmental protection agency’s energy star program to integrate intel power supply efficiency requirements into new energy star specifications for desktop computers intel also is working with other vendors industry groups and research institutions to develop energyefficient power supplies 

  

the manufacture assembly and testing of intel products require the use of hazardous materials that are subject to a broad array of ehs laws and regulations intel actively reviews what hazardous materials are used in the manufacture assembly and testing of our products particularly materials that end up in the final product intel has developed specific restrictions for the use of hazardous materials in our products as well as those of our suppliers and outsourced manufacturers and subcontractors intel’s proactive efforts to reduce the use of hazardous substances have positioned us well to meet environmental restrictions on product content throughout the world such as the restriction on hazardous substances rohs directive in the european union the rohs directive eliminates most uses of lead cadmium hexavalentchromium mercury and certain fire retardants in electronics placed on the market after july 1 2006 if this directive were in effect today it would impact about 85 of intel products due to the current use of tinlead solders intel published its leadfree product road map in april 2004 and we already manufacture and ship some products that are rohs compliant by the end of 2004 the company shipped several million rohscompliant flash products as well as our first rohscompliant cpus 

  

as intel continues to advance process technology the materials technologies and products themselves become increasingly complex our evaluations of new materials for use in rd manufacturing and assembly and test take into account ehs considerations and are a component of intel’s design for ehs processes many new materials being evaluated for use may be subject to regulation under existing or future laws and regulations failure to comply with any of the applicable laws or regulations could result in fines suspension of production alteration of fabrication and assembly processes curtailment of operations or sales and legal liability intel’s failure to properly manage the use transportation emission discharge storage recycling or disposal of hazardous materials could subject the company to future liabilities existing or future laws and regulations could require intel to procure pollution abatement or remediation equipment modify product designs or incur other expenses associated with the laws and regulations in addition restrictions on the use of certain materials in our facilities or products in the future could have a material adverse effect on our operations compliance with these complex laws and regulations as well as internal voluntary programs is integrated into our manufacturing and assembly and test processes to our knowledge compliance with these laws and regulations has had no material effect on our operations we also refer to the information under the heading “legal proceedings” in part i item 3 of this form 10k

corporate governance 

  

corporate governance is typically defined as the system that allocates duties and authority among a company’s stockholders board of directors and management the stockholders elect the board and vote on extraordinary matters the board is the company’s governing body responsible for hiring overseeing and evaluating management particularly the chief executive officer ceo and management runs the company’s daytoday operations the board believes that there should be a substantial majority of independent directors on the board the board also believes that it is useful and appropriate to have members of management including the chief executive officer as directors 

  

the board’s general policy based on experience is that the positions of chairman of the board and chief executive officer should be held by separate persons to aid in the board’s oversight of management in addition the board has an independent director designated as the lead independent director who is responsible for coordinating the activities of the other independent directors and performs various other duties the general authority and responsibilities of the lead independent director are established in a written charter adopted by the board 

  

the current board members include eight independent directors and three members of intel’s senior management the board members are craig r barrett intel’s chief executive officer ambassador charlene barshefsky senior international partner at the wilmer cutler pickering hale and dorr llp law firm e john p browne group chief executive of bp plc andrew s grove intel’s chairman of the board d james guzy chairman of arbor company reed e hundt principal charles ross partners paul s otellini intel’s president and chief operating officer david s pottruck managing director the pottruck group jane e shaw chairman and chief executive officer of aerogen inc john l thornton professor and director of global leadership at tsinghua university beijing china and david b yoffie professor of international business administration harvard business school the board also has one director emeritus gordon e moore who may participate in board meetings but does not vote

“independent” directors each of the company’s directors other than messrs grove barrett and otellini qualify as “independent” in accordance with the published listing requirements of the nasdaq stock market nasdaq the nasdaq independence definition includes a series of objective tests such as that the director is not an employee of the company and has not engaged in various types of business dealings with the company in addition as further required by the nasdaq rules the board of directors has made an affirmative determination as to each independent director that no relationships exist which in the opinion of the board would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director in making these determinations the board reviewed and discussed information provided by the directors and the company with regard to each director’s business and personal activities as they may relate to intel and intel’s management 

  

in addition the members of the audit committee of the board also each qualify as “independent” under special standards established by the us securities and exchange commission sec for members of audit committees and the audit committee includes at least one member who is determined by the board to meet the qualifications of an “audit committee financial expert” in accordance with sec rules including that the person meets the relevant definition of an “independent” director e john p browne is the independent director who has been determined to be an audit committee financial expert stockholders should understand that this designation is a disclosure requirement of the sec related to mr browne’s experience and understanding with respect to certain accounting and auditing matters the designation does not impose on mr browne any duties obligations or liability that are greater than are generally imposed on him as a member of the audit committee and board of directors and his designation as an audit committee financial expert pursuant to this sec requirement does not affect the duties obligations or liability of any other member of the audit committee or board of directors

the board does not have a formal policy that limits the number of board seats held by an independent director but the board’s guideline of 100 attendance at meetings reflects the board’s expectation that each director will meet his or her commitments to the position the time commitments of directors vary substantially with regard to their individual involvement with their primary positions and commercial charitable and other organizations the board believes that a limitation on board seats held by a director will not adequately express the key functional point about the director’s time commitment to intel 

  

intel has a policy and an approval process that generally limits each employee to serving on no more than one company board as a personal nonintel activity the approval process considers both the time commitment involved and the potential for business conflicts between intel and the other company this policy is applicable to intel’s three management directors and its other officers 

  

stock ownership guidelines directors and officers are encouraged to be stockholders of the company through their participation in the company’s stock option and employee stock participation plans stock ownership guidelines have been established by the board of directors for independent directors and corporate officers to better ensure that they each maintain an equity stake in the company and by doing so appropriately link their interests with those of the other stockholders these guidelines provide that within a fiveyear period following appointment or election the covered individuals should attain and hold an investment position not including unexercised stock options of no less than a specified number of shares of intel stock for officers approximating three to five times the sum of their base salary and annual incentive target depending on the individual’s scope of responsibilities and a similar guideline for independent directors directors and officers may not invest in purchase or otherwise receive or write derivatives of intel securities eg puts and calls on intel securities with limited exceptions or enter into any “short sales” or “short positions” with respect to intel securities a short position is one in which the person will profit if the market price of intel securities either remains the same or decreases intel considers it inappropriate and contrary to the interests of intel and its stockholders for directors and officers to take investment positions when the person would obtain a personal benefit in such a case

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend   

a tax matters 

  

in august 2003 in connection with the us internal revenue service’s irs’s regular examination of intel’s tax returns for the years 1999 and 2000 the irs proposed certain adjustments primarily related to the amounts reflected by intel on these returns as a tax benefit for its export sales in january 2005 the irs issued formal assessments for these adjustments the company does not agree with these adjustments and intends to appeal these assessments if the irs prevails in its position intel’s federal income tax due for these years would increase by approximately 600 million plus interest the irs may make similar claims for years subsequent to 2000 in future audits 

  

although the final resolution of the adjustments is uncertain based on currently available information management believes that the ultimate outcome will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position cash flows or overall trends in results of operations there is the possibility of a material adverse impact on the results of operations of the period in which the matter is ultimately resolved if it is resolved unfavorably or in the period in which an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable 

  

b litigation 

  

intel currently is a party to various legal proceedings including those noted below while management presently believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings individually and in the aggregate will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position cash flows or overall trends in results of operations litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur an unfavorable ruling could include money damages or in cases for which injunctive relief is sought an injunction prohibiting intel from selling one or more products were an unfavorable ruling to occur there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the net income of the period in which the ruling occurs or future periods

this mda should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this annual report on form 10k including part i “item 1 business” part ii “item 6 selected financial data” and part ii “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” the various sections of this mda contain a number of forwardlooking statements all of which are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risk factors described throughout this filing and particularly in the “business outlook” section our actual results may differ materially and these forwardlooking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any divestitures mergers acquisitions or other business combinations that had not been completed as of february 16 2005 

  

strategy 

  

our goal is to be the preeminent building block supplier to the worldwide digital economy as part of our overall strategy to compete in each relevant market segment we use our core competencies in the design and manufacture of integrated circuits and our financial resources as well as our global presence and brand recognition our global marketing strategy is designed to associate our brands with advanced technology and innovation in addition under our intel capital program we make equity investments in companies around the world to further our strategic objectives and support our key business initiatives 

  

our primary focus is on developing advanced integrated silicon technology solutions which we believe will provide the performance necessary to help accelerate the convergence of computing and communications capabilities with digital content convergence refers to combining computing and communications capabilities in an integrated product solution we believe that convergence is occurring primarily in three areas the digital home the digital enterprise and with mobile internet users we also provide key components for networking and communications infrastructures used to connect technology users 

  

we believe that users of computing and communications devices want improved performance which includes faster processing performance andor improved capabilities such as multithreading or multitasking lower system power consumption seamless connectivity improved security reliability ease of use and interoperability among devices it is our goal to incorporate features addressing these capabilities in our various products to meet user demands we also believe that our customers who build computing and communications systems and devices will benefit if our products incorporating these capabilities are based on a platform solution we define a platform as a collection of silicon components and software designed to provide a better user solution when used in combination than if used separately the success of our strategies to add more features to our microprocessors and offer platform solutions is dependent on our ability to select and incorporate features that customers value and to market those features effectively 

  

we view technology standards as an important way to advance new technologies and foster industry infrastructures or ecosystems we work with the industry in various areas to help establish technology standards ultimately incorporating many of these standards into our own product offerings 

  

as we move to each succeeding generation of manufacturing process technology we use less space per transistor which enables us to fit more transistors on an equivalent size chip decrease the size of the chip or offer an increased number of integrated features this decrease in size can also result in faster microprocessors and semiconductor products that consume less power andor products that cost less to manufacture 

  

under our intel capital program we make equity investments in companies around the world to further our strategic objectives and support our key business initiatives the intel capital program generally focuses on investing in companies and initiatives to stimulate growth in the digital economy create new business opportunities for intel and expand global markets for our products the investments may support among other things intel product initiatives emerging trends in the technology industry or worldwide internet deployment we invest in companies that develop software hardware or services supporting our technologies our current investment focus areas include enabling mobile wireless devices helping to advance the digital home enhancing the digital enterprise advancing highperformance communications infrastructures and developing the next generation of silicon production technologies our focus areas tend to develop and change over time due to rapid advancements in technology

critical accounting estimates 

  

the methods estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements which we discuss under the heading “results of operations” following this section of our mda some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain our most critical accounting estimates include the assessment of recoverability of goodwill which impacts goodwill impairments valuation of nonmarketable equity securities which impacts net gains losses on equity securities when we record impairments valuation of inventory which impacts gross margin assessment of recoverability of longlived assets which primarily impacts gross margin when we impair manufacturing assets or accelerate their depreciation and recognition and measurement of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities which impact our tax provision below we discuss these policies further as well as the estimates and judgments involved we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies such as for revenue recognition including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors however these policies do not require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective

goodwill goodwill is recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired we perform an annual review in the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist to determine if the carrying value of the recorded goodwill is impaired our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which goodwill resides to its carrying value reporting units may be operating segments as a whole or an operation one level below an operating segment referred to as a component components are defined as operations for which discrete financial information is available and reviewed by segment management the icg operating segment is made up of two reporting units the flash memory reporting unit and the icg reporting unit all of the icg operating segment goodwill is included in the icg reporting unit our review process uses the income method to estimate the reporting unit’s fair value and is based on a discounted future cash flow approach that uses the following reporting unit estimates revenue based on assumed market segment growth rates and intel’s assumed market segment share estimated costs and appropriate discount rates based on the reporting units’ weighted average cost of capital as determined by considering the observable weighted average cost of capital of comparable companies our estimates of market segment growth our market segment share and costs are based on historical data various internal estimates and a variety of external sources and are developed as part of our routine longrange planning process the same estimates are also used in planning for our longterm manufacturing and assembly and test capacity needs as part of our capital budgeting process and for both longterm and shortterm business planning and forecasting we test the reasonableness of the inputs and outcomes of our discounted cash flow analysis against available comparable market data in determining the carrying value of the reporting unit we must include an allocation of our manufacturing and assembly and test assets because of the interchangeable nature of our manufacturing and assembly and test capacity this allocation is based on each reporting unit’s relative percentage utilization of our manufacturing and assembly and test assets during the fourth quarter of 2004 we completed our most recent review and determined that the fair value of the icg reporting unit was in excess of its carrying value therefore goodwill was not impaired our review of goodwill in 2003 resulted in a 611 million noncash impairment charge related to the thenexisting wireless communications and computing group reporting unit a substantial majority of our remaining recorded goodwill is related to the icg reporting unit the estimates we used in our most recent annual review for the icg reporting unit assume that we will gain market segment share in the future and that the communications business will experience a gradual recovery and return to growth from the current trends prior to the combination of our communicationsrelated businesses our consumer electronics business which was previously part of our former icg operating segment was moved to our intel architecture business based on the estimated fair value of the consumer electronics business relative to the former icg reporting unit goodwill of 466 million was transferred to our intel architecture business in january 2005 we announced a planned reorganization of our business groups that will change the operating segments where the goodwill resides as well as the reporting units that are used to evaluate goodwill for impairment 

  

nonmarketable equity securities under our intel capital program we typically invest in nonmarketable equity securities of private companies which range from earlystage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies whose products or technologies may directly support an intel product or initiative at december 25 2004 the carrying value of our portfolio of strategic investments in nonmarketable equity securities excluding equity derivatives totaled 507 million 665 million at december 27 2003 

  

investments in nonmarketable equity securities are inherently risky and a number of these companies are likely to fail their success or lack thereof is dependent on product development market acceptance operational efficiency and other key business success factors in addition depending on their future prospects they may not be able to raise additional funds when needed or they may receive lower valuations with less favorable investment terms than in previous financings and the investments would likely become impaired in the current equity market environment while the availability of additional funding from venture capital sources has improved the companies’ ability to take advantage of liquidity events such as initial public offerings mergers and private sales remains constrained 

  

we review all of our investments quarterly for indicators of impairment however for nonmarketable equity securities the impairment analysis requires significant judgment to identify events or circumstances that would likely have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment the indicators that we use to identify those events or circumstances include a the investee’s revenue and earnings trends relative to predefined milestones and overall business prospects b the technological feasibility of the investee’s products and technologies c the general market conditions in the investee’s industry or geographic area including adverse regulatory or economic changes d factors related to the investee’s ability to remain in business such as the investee’s liquidity debt ratios and the rate at which the investee is using its cash and e the investee’s receipt of additional funding at a lower valuation 

  

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

continued 

  

investments identified as having an indicator of impairment are subject to further analysis to determine if the investment is other than temporarily impaired in which case we write the investment down to its impaired value when an investee is not considered viable from a financial or technological point of view we write down the entire investment since we consider the estimated fair market value to be nominal if an investee obtains additional funding at a valuation lower than our carrying amount or requires a new round of equity funding to stay in operation and the new funding does not appear imminent we presume that the investment is other than temporarily impaired unless specific facts and circumstances indicate otherwise impairments of investments in our portfolio primarily impairments of nonmarketable equity securities were approximately 117 million in 2004 319 million in 2003 and 524 million in 2002 

  

inventory the valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality the determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products within specific time horizons generally six months or less the estimates of future demand that we use in the valuation of inventory are the basis for our published revenue forecasts which are also consistent with our shortterm manufacturing plans if our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly we could be required to write down additional inventory which would have a negative impact on our gross margin 

  

longlived assets we assess the impairment of longlived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant underperformance of a business or product line in relation to expectations significant negative industry or economic trends and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets recoverability of assets that will continue to be used in our operations is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to our estimate of the related total future net cash flows if an asset grouping’s carrying value is not recoverable through the related cash flows the asset grouping is considered to be impaired the impairment is measured by the difference between the asset grouping’s carrying amount and its fair value based on the best information available including market prices or discounted cash flow analysis 

  

impairments of longlived assets are determined for groups of assets related to the lowest level of identifiable independent cash flows due to our asset usage model and the interchangeable nature of our semiconductor manufacturing capacity we must make subjective judgments in determining the independent cash flows that can be related to specific asset groupings in addition as we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions we must make subjective judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets primarily processspecific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements when we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated and there are sufficient cash flows to support the carrying value of the assets we accelerate the rate of depreciation charges in order to fully depreciate the assets over their new shorter useful lives 

  

income taxes we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits tax benefits and deductions such as the tax benefit for export sales and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 

  

we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets if recovery is not likely we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable we believe that a substantial majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our balance sheet will ultimately be recovered however should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely 

  

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional tax payments are probable if we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary we record an additional charge in our provision for taxes in the period in which we determine that the recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be for a discussion of current tax matters see “note 10 provision for taxes” and “note 18 contingencies” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k

results of operations 

  

overview 

  

in 2004 we experienced another year of doubledigit growth in annual revenue and gross margin dollars our intel architecture business contributed most of this growth largely from higher unit sales of microprocessors the intel architecture business continues to represent a large percentage of our business accounting for 85 of our 2004 consolidated net revenue within icg we saw 28 growth in revenue mostly driven by higher unit sales of our flash memory products in 2004 we also ramped the production of our 90nanometer process technology on 300millimeter mm wafers and exited the year with the majority of our processor shipments to the computing industry based on this technology we continue to see strength in both our emerging and mature markets for 2004 we increased the operating profit in our intel architecture business by 17 and reduced the losses slightly in our communications business in addition our business continued to generate significant cash and we were able to use 75 billion to buy back our stock and pay 10 billion in dividends while maintaining our strong financial position 

  

in 2005 we are planning for further growth in both annual revenue and gross margin dollars with higher unit sales for microprocessors however we are also expecting higher manufacturing startup costs related to the ramp of our 65nanometer process technology particularly in the first half of 2005 growth in sales and profitability depends on our ability to successfully ramp new products and to obtain continuing benefits from the productive use of our manufacturing assets we expect to introduce our first dualcore processors in 2005 as we continue to focus on enabling more capabilities performance and flexibility for users beyond processor speed we also plan to design our products around entire platforms in line with this platform focus in january 2005 we announced a reorganization to align our business groups across our major platform initiatives because the reporting period for this form 10k is as of december 25 2004 the results of operations for all comparative periods including the comparison of the 2003 to 2002 results are presented under the organizational structure that existed as of december 25 2004 

  

the following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of income data as a percentage of net revenue for the periods indicated 

  

   

the following table sets forth information on our geographic regions for the periods indicated 

  

   

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

continued 

  

our net revenue for 2004 was 342 billion an increase of 41 billion or 135 compared to 2003 this increase was primarily due to higher net revenue from sales of microprocessors in our intel architecture business accompanied by higher net revenue for icg 

  

our asiapacific region’s revenue made up the largest portion of our total revenue during 2004 and increased 26 reflecting both growth in local consumption and movement of more of the production for our customers’ pc supply chain to asia this movement in the supply chain negatively affected the americas region with a decrease in revenue of 5 in 2004 compared to 2003 japan revenue increased 15 and the europe region’s revenue increased 13 in 2004 compared to 2003 

  

overall gross margin dollars were 197 billion an increase of 27 billion or 16 compared to 2003 our overall gross margin percentage increased to 577 in 2004 from 567 in 2003 the gross margin percentage for the intel architecture business was higher than in 2003 and the gross margin percentage in our communications business was lower than in 2003 see “business outlook” on page 40 of this section for a discussion of gross margin expectations 

  

our net revenue for 2003 was 301 billion an increase of 13 compared to 2002 this increase in net revenue was primarily from our intel architecture business which had increased sales of microprocessors and chipsets this increase was partially offset by lower net revenue for icg 

  

in 2003 our asiapacific region’s revenue made up the largest portion of our total revenue and increased 21 compared to 2002 reflecting growth in local consumption and movement of more of the production for our customers’ pc supply chain to asia revenue in europe improved increasing 12 in 2003 compared to 2002 japan experienced substantial improvement with increased revenue of 42 primarily driven by retail sales as well as higher notebook exports by japanese manufacturers revenue from the americas region continued to decrease as a percent of our total revenue and declined 3 in 2003 compared to 2002 in 2003 we continued to experience growth in emerging markets in asia and europe and began to see some evidence of higher technology infrastructure spending in mature markets in europe and the us 

  

our overall gross margin percentage increased to 567 for 2003 from 498 in 2002 improved gross margin within the intel architecture business as well as a shift in the total company revenue mix to the higher margin intel architecture business contributed to our improved total gross margin improvement in the intel architecture gross margin was partially offset by a decline in the gross margin percentage for icg 

  

intel architecture business 

  

the revenue and operating income for the intel architecture operating segment for the three years ended december 25 2004 were as follows 

  

   

revenue for the intel architecture operating segment increased by 30 billion or 11 in 2004 compared to 2003 revenue from sales of microprocessors increased 12 while revenue from sales of chipsets and motherboards increased 11 the increase in intel architecture revenue was primarily due to higher unit sales for microprocessors in the computing market segment sales of microprocessors designed for the desktop mobile and server market segments all increased substantially in 2004 consistent with this increase in sales of microprocessors we also experienced higher unit sales of our chipsets and motherboards in 2004 compared to 2003 we ramped our 90nanometer process technology in 2004 and exited the year with the majority of our microprocessors shipped being manufactured on this technology 

  

operating income increased to 121 billion in 2004 compared to 104 billion in 2003 the 17 increase was primarily due to the impact of higher revenue and lower unit costs for microprocessors as well as approximately 160 million of lower manufacturing startup costs these increases in operating income were partially offset by higher operating expenses and a 162 million charge in q1 2004 relating to a settlement agreement with intergraph corporation 

  

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

continued 

  

for 2003 revenue for the intel architecture operating segment increased by 38 billion or 17 compared to 2002 revenue from sales of microprocessors increased 17 while revenue from sales of chipsets and motherboards increased 16 the increase in intel architecture revenue was primarily due to significantly higher unit sales and to a lesser extent due to a slightly higher average selling price for microprocessors as well as significantly higher unit sales of chipsets in 2003 during 2003 we rapidly ramped the intel centrino mobile technology and the pentium m processor for mobile computers we also saw increased sales of pentium 4 processors with ht technology and higher sales of intel xeon processors in the server market segment 

  

operating income increased by 39 billion or 59 in 2003 compared to 2002 the increase was primarily due to the impact of higher revenue lower unit costs for microprocessors and chipsets and charges for underutilized factory capacity that were lower than in 2002 by approximately 150 million these improvements were partially offset by approximately 390 million of higher startup costs in 2003 related to the ramp of 90nanometer technology on 300mm wafer manufacturing 

  

intel communications group 

  

the revenue and operating loss for the icg operating segment for the three years ended december 25 2004 were as follows 

  

   

revenue increased by 11 billion or 28 in 2004 compared to 2003 primarily due to higher revenue from higher unit sales of flash memory products embedded processing components and wireless connectivity products revenue from flash memory products increased to 23 billion in 2004 from 16 billion in 2003 

  

the operating loss decreased to 791 million in 2004 from a loss of 824 million in 2003 contributing to the lower operating loss were higher revenue as well as approximately 100 million from lower inventory writeoffs for flash memory products due to improved demand and sales of flash memory product inventory that had been previously written down these improvements were partially offset by higher unit costs for flash memory products as we sold higher density products as well as the negative impact of reducing the carrying value of ending inventory to lower current replacement costs in addition higher startup costs in 2004 of approximately 160 million partially offset the decrease in operating loss 

  

for 2003 revenue decreased by 360 million or 8 compared to 2002 the decrease was primarily due to lower unit sales of flash memory products revenue from flash memory products decreased to 16 billion in 2003 from 21 billion in 2002 in 2003 revenue for flash memory products was negatively affected by lost business as a result of the pricing strategy on certain products this decrease was partially offset by increases in revenue for wireless connectivity products increases in revenue from sales of application processors for dataenabled cellular phones and handheld computing devices and increases in revenue from sales of embedded processing components 

  

the operating loss remained relatively flat in 2003 at 824 million compared to 817 million in 2002 negative impacts to the operating results included lower revenue and higher inventory writeoffs for flash memory products and a mix shift to lower margin wired connectivity products these negative impacts were offset primarily by a decrease in operating expenses of 160 million in 2003 as we continued our efforts to streamline operations and refocus on our core strategic areas

operating expenses 

  

operating expenses for the three years ended december 25 2004 were as follows 

  

   

research and development spending increased 418 million or 10 in 2004 compared to 2003 and increased 326 million or 8 in 2003 compared to 2002 this increase in 2004 compared to 2003 was primarily due to higher expenses related to development for manufacturing process technologies including the 65nanometer process on 300mm wafers and higher expenses for product development programs in the intel architecture business as well as higher profitdependent compensation expenses the increase in 2003 compared to 2002 was primarily due to higher expenses for product development programs in the intel architecture business and higher spending on the development of manufacturing process technologies including the 65nanometer process technology as well as higher profitdependent compensation expenses 

  

marketing general and administrative expenses increased 381 million or 9 in 2004 compared to 2003 the increase in 2004 was primarily due to higher cooperative advertising expenses as a result of higher revenue in our intel architecture business and because our customers used a higher percentage of their available intel inside ® program funds and increased profitdependent compensation expenses in addition the increase was due to higher marketing expenses from additional marketing programs and increased advertising expenses marketing general and administrative expenses were flat in 2003 compared to 2002 in 2003 we lowered our discretionary spending and other expenses as we reduced headcount and refocused on core strategic areas this decrease in expenses was offset by higher marketing expenses due to the launch of the intel centrino mobile technology brand in 2003 increased profitdependent compensation expenses and higher expenses related to the intel inside cooperative advertising program primarily due to higher microprocessor revenue 

  

research and development along with marketing general and administrative expenses were approximately 28 of net revenue in 2004 29 of net revenue in 2003 and 31 of net revenue in 2002 

  

amortization of acquisitionrelated intangibles and costs was 179 million in 2004 301 million in 2003 and 548 million in 2002 the decreased amortization each year compared to the previous year was primarily due to a portion of the intangibles related to prior acquisitions becoming fully amortized 

  

during the fourth quarter of 2004 we completed our annual impairment review for goodwill and determined that the fair value of the icg reporting unit was in excess of its carrying value therefore goodwill was not impaired in our 2003 goodwill impairment review we found indicators of impairment for the thenexisting wccg reporting unit at that time the wccg business comprising primarily flash memory products and cellular baseband chipsets had not performed as management had expected in the fourth quarter of 2003 it became apparent that wccg was expected to grow more slowly than previously projected a slowerthanexpected rollout of products and slowerthanexpected customer acceptance of our products in the baseband chipset business as well as a delay in the transition to nextgeneration phone networks had pushed out the forecasts for sales of products for highend data cell phones these factors resulted in lower growth expectations for the reporting unit and triggered a 611 million charge for impairment of goodwill also during 2003 we recorded a 6 million charge for impairment of the goodwill related to one of our seed businesses seed businesses support the company’s strategic initiatives

losses on equity securities and certain equity derivatives for 2004 were 2 million compared to 283 million for 2003 the improvement was primarily driven by lower impairment charges on investments particularly on nonmarketable equity securities approximately 117 million for 2004 and 319 million for 2003 the decrease in the impairment charges in 2004 reflected the decrease in the total carrying amount of the nonmarketable equity investment portfolio over the past couple of years the net loss for 2003 also included marktomarket losses on certain equity securities and equity derivatives offset by gains on equity transactions completed in 2003 

  

losses on equity securities and certain equity derivatives for 2003 decreased to 283 million compared to 372 million for 2002 the lower net loss for 2003 was primarily due to lower impairment charges for 2002 the impairment charges of 524 million were partially offset by net gains of approximately 57 million related to equity securities designated as trading assets and 110 million of net gains on related equity derivatives the 57 million in net gains included a gain of approximately 120 million resulting from the designation of formerly restricted equity investments as trading assets as they became marketable the cumulative difference between their cost and fair market value at the time they became marketable was recorded as a gain in 2002 

  

interest and other net increased to 289 million in 2004 compared to 192 million in 2003 reflecting higher interest income as a result of higher average investment balances and higher interest rates interest and other net for 2004 also included approximately 60 million of gains associated with terminating financing arrangements for manufacturing facilities and equipment in ireland 

  

our effective income tax rate was 278 in 2004 242 in 2003 and 259 in 2002 the increase in the rate for 2004 was primarily due to a higher amount of tax benefits related to divestitures during 2003 partially offset by an increase in the benefit for export sales the tax rate for 2004 included a 195 million reduction to the tax provision primarily from additional benefits for export sales along with higher than anticipated state tax benefits for divestitures as well as the reversal of previously accrued taxes of 62 million primarily related to the closing of a state income tax audit the rate for 2003 included a 758 million reduction to the tax provision related to divestitures partially offset by the nondeductible goodwill impairment charge 

  

the decrease in the effective tax rate in 2003 compared to 2002 was primarily attributed to the tax benefits of 758 million related to divestitures that closed during 2003 although the pretax losses on the divestitures for financial statement purposes were not significant the company was able to recognize tax losses because the tax basis in the stock of the companies sold exceeded the book basis the impact of these benefits was partially offset by the nondeductible goodwill impairment charge recorded in 2003 and a higher percentage of profits in higher tax jurisdictions

financial condition 

  

our financial condition remains strong at december 25 2004 cash shortterm investments and fixed income debt instruments included in trading assets totaled 168 billion up from 159 billion at december 27 2003 at december 25 2004 total shortterm and longterm debt was 904 million and represented approximately 2 of stockholders’ equity at december 27 2003 total debt was 12 billion and represented approximately 3 of stockholders’ equity 

  

cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain noncash items and changes in assets and liabilities for 2004 cash provided by operating activities was 131 billion compared to 115 billion in 2003 and 91 billion in 2002 in 2004 the majority of the increase in cash provided by operating activities was due to higher net income working capital sources of cash included increases in income taxes payable accrued compensation and benefits and accounts payable the increase in income taxes payable was primarily due to the timing of refunds and higher earnings in 2004 compared to 2003 partially offset by higher estimated tax payments made for 2004 accrued compensation and benefits increased primarily due to higher accruals related to employee bonuses accounts payable was higher primarily due to the timing of capital expenditures accounts receivable was relatively flat in 2004 compared to 2003 and increased in 2003 over 2002 levels primarily due to higher revenue in 2003 despite an increase in sales the days’ sales outstanding decreased to 34 days at december 2004 compared to 36 days at december 2003 and 34 days at december 2002 the decrease in 2004 was due to a higher proportion of sales occurring at the beginning of the fourth quarter for 2004 our three largest customers accounted for approximately 42 of net revenue with one of these customers accounting for approximately 19 of revenue and another customer accounting for approximately 16 for 2003 our three largest customers accounted for approximately 42 of net revenue 38 of net revenue for 2002 additionally these three largest customers accounted for approximately 45 of net accounts receivable at december 25 2004 approximately 43 at december 27 2003 and 39 at december 28 2002 inventories were relatively flat in 2004 compared to 2003 levels but represented increases over 2002 primarily due to ramping of new products at that time during 2003 working capital uses of cash also included a decrease in income taxes payable 

  

investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures and the proceeds of investments sold and payment for investments acquired we used 50 billion in net cash for investing activities during 2004 compared to 71 billion during 2003 and 58 billion during 2002 the higher cash used in investing activities in 2003 resulted from higher net purchases of availableforsale investments due to improved corporate credit profiles that facilitated a slight shift in our portfolio of investments in debt securities to longer term maturities during that year capital expenditures were 38 billion 37 billion and 47 billion in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively reflecting a lower investment in capital equipment and construction primarily for additional microprocessor manufacturing capacity in recent years capital spending for 2005 is expected to be between 49 billion and 53 billion primarily driven by investments in 300mm 65nanometer production equipment 

  

financing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases and retirement of common stock and payment of dividends to stockholders we used 77 billion in net cash for financing activities in 2004 compared to 39 billion in 2003 and 2002 during 2004 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 500 million shares of common stock under the company’s ongoing stock repurchase program and in 2004 we purchased 301 million shares of common stock for 75 billion 176 million shares for 40 billion in 2003 and 183 million shares for 40 billion in 2002 at december 25 2004 approximately 614 million shares remained available for repurchase under existing repurchase authorizations payment of dividends was 10 billion in 2004 524 million in 2003 and 533 million in 2002 due to an increase in the quarterly cash dividend from 002 per share to 004 per share effective beginning in the first quarter of 2004 on february 2 2005 our board of directors declared a cash dividend of 008 per common share for the first quarter of 2005 the dividend is payable on march 1 2005 to stockholders of record on february 7 2005 financing sources of cash during 2004 were primarily 894 million in proceeds from the sale of shares pursuant to employee equity incentive plans 967 million in 2003 and 681 million in 2002 

  

another potential source of liquidity is authorized borrowings including commercial paper of 30 billion maximum borrowings under our commercial paper program during 2004 were approximately 550 million although no commercial paper was outstanding at the end of the period we also maintain the ability to issue an aggregate of approximately 14 billion in debt equity and other securities under us securities and exchange commission sec shelf registration statements 

  

we believe that we have the financial resources needed to meet business requirements for the next 12 months including capital expenditures for the expansion or upgrading of worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test capacity working capital requirements the dividend program potential stock repurchases and potential future acquisitions or strategic investments

contractual obligations 

  

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at december 25 2004 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods this table excludes amounts already recorded on our balance sheet as current liabilities at december 25 2004 

  

     

   

   

contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on intel and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons in addition some of our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities and set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months therefore agreements for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above agreements for outsourced services generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty and are therefore not included in the table above 

  

contractual obligations that are contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones are not included in the table above these obligations include contingent funding obligations milestonebased equity investment funding and acquisitionrelated deferred cash compensation contingent upon future employment these arrangements are not considered contractual obligations until the milestone is met by the third party as of december 25 2004 assuming all future milestones were met additional required payments would be approximately 23 million 

  

the expected timing of payments of the obligations above is estimated based on current information timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations amounts disclosed as contingent or milestonebased obligations are dependent on the achievement of the milestones or the occurrence of the contingent events and can vary significantly 

  

offbalancesheet arrangements 

  

as of december 25 2004 we did not have any significant offbalancesheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk

employee equity incentive plans 

  

our stock option program is a broadbased longterm retention program that is intended to attract and retain talented employees and align stockholder and employee interests in may 2004 stockholder approval was obtained for the 2004 equity incentive plan the 2004 plan under the 2004 plan 240 million shares of common stock were made available for issuance during the twoyear period ending june 30 2006 under the 2004 plan options to purchase shares may be granted to all employees and nonemployee directors we may also use other types of equity incentive awards such as restricted stock stock units and stock appreciation rights the 2004 plan also allows for performancebased vesting for equity incentive awards we presently expect to request stockholder approval at our may 2005 annual stockholders’ meeting to extend the term of the 2004 plan by one year to june 30 2007 and make additional common shares available for issuance as equity awards to employees and nonemployee directors during this period 

  

we have a goal to keep the potential incremental dilution related to our option program to a longterm average of less than 2 annually the dilution percentage is calculated using the new option grants for the year net of options cancelled due to employees leaving the company and options expired divided by the total outstanding shares at the beginning of the year 

  

options granted to employees including officers and nonemployee directors from 2000 through 2004 are summarized as follows 

  

     

   

   

in accordance with a policy established by the compensation committee of the board of directors total options granted to listed officers may not exceed 5 of total options granted in any year during 2004 options granted to listed officers amounted to 11 of the grants made to all employees all stock option grants to executive officers are made after a review by and with the approval of the compensation committee all members of the compensation committee are independent directors as defined in the applicable rules for issuers traded on the nasdaq stock market 

  

for additional information regarding the equity incentive plans and the activity for the past three years see “note 11 employee equity incentive plans” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k information regarding our equity incentive plans should be read in conjunction with the information appearing under the heading “report of the compensation committee on executive compensation” in our 2005 proxy statement which is incorporated by reference

1997 stock option plan 

  

the 1997 stock option plan the 1997 plan provided for the grant of stock options to employees other than officers and directors this plan which was not approved by stockholders was terminated as to future grants when the 2004 plan was approved by the stockholders in may 2004 the 1997 plan is administered by the compensation committee of the board of directors which has the power to determine matters relating to outstanding option awards under the plan including conditions of vesting and exercisability options granted under the 1997 plan expire no later than 10 years from the grant date options granted under this plan generally vest within five years with some options granted in 2003 and 2004 vesting in increments over four or five years from the date of grant and certain grants to key employees having delayed vesting generally beginning six years from the date of grant

business outlook 

  

in 2005 we are planning for continued growth in annual revenue and increasing gross margin dollars we also expect to see continued growth in the total number of computers using our microprocessors further we expect continued benefit from the productive use of our 90nanometer process technology on 300mm wafers at the same time we will continue to invest in our next generation 65nanometer process technology revenue for icg is largely dependent on our continuing to secure design wins for our customers’ new and existing products on supplying the products for these design wins and on oems taking the product designs to production demand for our flash memory products is uncertain in the highly competitive cellular handset market segment revenue growth for our flash memory products is largely dependent on customer demand for higher density flash memory and continued user adoption of new leadingedge cellular handsets the statements below do not include any impact related to the expensing of stock options according to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” if we had applied sfas no 123r to our results for the year ended december 25 2004 our gross margin percentage would have been lower by approximately one percentage point in addition the expensing of stock options would increase operating expenses which include both rd expenses and marketing general and administrative expenses and would affect the tax rate see “note 2 accounting policies” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

  

our financial results are substantially dependent on sales of microprocessors and related components by the intel architecture operating segment revenue is partly a function of the mix of types and performance capabilities of microprocessors sold as well as the mix of related chipsets and motherboards all of which are difficult to forecast because of the wide price differences among desktop mobile and server microprocessors the mix of types and performance levels of microprocessors sold affects the average selling price that we will realize and has a large impact on our revenue and gross margin microprocessor revenue is also dependent on the availability of other parts of the system platform including chipsets motherboards operating system software and application software revenue is also affected by our sales of other semiconductor and nonsemiconductor products and is subject to the impact of economic conditions in various geographic regions 

  

our gross margin expectation for 2005 is 58 plus or minus a few points the 58 midpoint is approximately flat compared to our 2004 gross margin of 577 in the first half of 2005 higher unit volumes for microprocessors and higher factory utilization are expected to be offset by higher startup costs related to the ramp of our 65nanometer process technology in the second half of 2005 these startup costs should decline and if our business progresses according to typical seasonal patterns we expect our gross margin percentage to be higher than in the first half of 2005 

  

our gross margin varies primarily with revenue levels which are dependent on unit volumes and prices as well as the mix of types and performance levels of processors sold and the mix of microprocessors related chipsets and motherboards and other semiconductor and nonsemiconductor products variability of other factors will also continue to affect cost of sales and the gross margin percentage including unit costs and yield issues associated with production at our factories timing and execution of the production ramp excess of manufacturing or assembly and test capacity the reusability of factory equipment impairment of manufacturing or assembly and test assets excess inventory inventory obsolescence and variations in inventory valuation 

  

we have significantly expanded our semiconductor manufacturing and assembly and test capacity over the last few years and we continue to plan capacity based on the assumed continued success of our overall strategy and the acceptance of our products in specific market segments we currently expect that capital spending will be between 49 billion and 53 billion in 2005 compared to 38 billion in 2004 the midpoint of this range 51 billion is significantly higher than in 2004 most of the projected increase will be spent to ramp capacity on our 65nanometer process technology in 300mm factories in fact 90 of our fab equipment spending is anticipated to be on 65nanometer process technology this capitalspending plan is dependent on expectations regarding production efficiencies and delivery times of various machinery and equipment and construction schedules if the demand for our products does not grow and continue to move toward higher performance products in the various market segments revenue and gross margin would be adversely affected and manufacturing andor assembly and test capacity would be underutilized and the rate of capital spending could be reduced we could be required to record an impairment of our manufacturing or assembly and test equipment andor facilities or factory planning decisions may cause us to record accelerated depreciation however in the long term revenue and gross margin may also be affected if we do not add capacity fast enough to meet market demand 

  

depreciation for 2005 is expected to be approximately 44 billion plus or minus 100 million compared to 46 billion in 2004 

  

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

continued 

  

our industry is characterized by very short product life cycles and our continued success is dependent on technological advancement including developing and implementing new processes and strategic products for specific market segments because we consider it imperative to maintain a strong research and development program spending for research and development in 2005 is expected to increase to approximately 52 billion from 48 billion in 2004 

  

based on acquisitions completed through february 16 2005 we expect amortization of acquisitionrelated intangibles and costs to be approximately 120 million in 2005 

  

at the end of 2004 we held nonmarketable equity securities with a carrying value of 507 million a number of these companies are likely to fail their success or lack thereof is dependent upon product development market acceptance operational efficiency and other key business success factors in addition depending on their future prospects they may not be able to raise additional financings when needed or they may receive lower valuations with less favorable investment terms than in previous financings and the investments would likely become impaired however we are not able to determine at the present time which specific investments are likely to be impaired in the future or the extent or timing of individual impairments 

  

our nonmarketable equity securities are part of the intel capital program the program seeks to invest in companies and businesses that can succeed and have an impact on their market segment however these types of investments involve a great deal of risk and there can be no assurance that any specific company whether at an early or mature stage or somewhere in between will grow or will be successful consequently we could lose all or part of our investment when the strategic objectives of an investment have been achieved or if the investment or business diverges from our strategic objectives we may decide to dispose of the investment however our investments in nonmarketable equity securities are not liquid and there can be no assurance that we will be able to dispose of these investments on favorable terms or at all 

  

we currently expect our tax rate to be approximately 31 for 2005 the estimated effective tax rate is based on tax law in effect at december 25 2004 and current expected income and assumes that the company will continue to receive the tax benefit for export sales see “note 10 provision for taxes” and “note 18 contingencies” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k the tax rate expectation for 2005 does not reflect the impact of any potential repatriation of earnings under the american jobs creation act of 2004 the jobs act as we are currently reviewing the provisions of the jobs act if we were to repatriate earnings our tax expense would increase the tax rate may also be affected by the closing of acquisitions or divestitures the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed changes in estimates of credits and deductions the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities the finalization of various tax returns and changes in our ability to realize deferred tax assets 

  

we are currently a party to various legal proceedings and claims including legal proceedings and claims related to taxes and to allegations of patent infringement management does not believe that the ultimate outcome of these legal proceedings and claims will have a material adverse effect on our financial position cash flows or overall trends in results of operations however litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur an unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages invalidation of a patent or group of patents additional taxes owed or in cases where injunctive relief is sought an injunction prohibiting intel from selling one or more products if an unfavorable ruling were to occur in any specific period there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the results of operations of that period or future periods management believes that given our current liquidity and cash and investment balances even an adverse judgment would not have a material impact on cash and investments or liquidity 

  

we operate globally with sales offices and research and development as well as manufacturing and assembly and test facilities in many countries and as a result we are subject to risks and factors associated with doing business outside the us global operations involve inherent risks that include currency controls and fluctuations tariff and import regulations and regulatory requirements that may limit our or our customers’ ability to manufacture assemble and test design develop or sell products in particular countries if terrorist activity armed conflict civil or military unrest or political instability occurs in the us israel or other locations such events may disrupt manufacturing assembly and test logistics security and communications and could also result in reduced demand for our products the impacts of major health concerns or possible infrastructure disruptions such as largescale outages or interruptions of service from utilities or telecommunications providers on intel its suppliers customers or other third parties could also adversely affect our business and impact customer order patterns business continuity could also be affected if labor issues disrupt our transportation arrangements or those of our customers or suppliers in addition we may rely on a single or limited number of suppliers or upon suppliers in a single country on a worldwide basis we regularly review our key infrastructure systems services and suppliers both internally and externally to seek to identify significant vulnerabilities as well as areas of potential business impact if a disruptive event were to occur once identified we assess the risks and as we consider it to be appropriate we initiate actions intended to reduce the risks and their potential impact however there can be no assurance that we have identified all significant risks or that we can mitigate all identified risks with reasonable effort

our future results of operations and the other forwardlooking statements contained in this filing including this mda involve a number of risks and uncertainties—in particular the statements regarding our goals and strategies new product introductions plans to cultivate new businesses market segment share and growth rate assumptions future economic conditions and recovery in the communications businesses revenue pricing gross margin and costs capital spending depreciation and amortization research and development expenses potential impairment of investments the tax rate and pending tax and legal proceedings in addition to the various important factors discussed above a number of other factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations demand for our products which impacts our revenue and gross margin percentage is affected by business and economic conditions as well as computing and communications industry trends and the development and timing of introduction of compelling software applications and operating systems that take advantage of the features of our products demand for our products is also affected by changes in customer order patterns such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by our customers and the timing of customer purchases intel operates in intensely competitive industries and our revenue and gross margin could be affected by factors such as competing chip architectures and manufacturing technologies competing softwarecompatible microprocessors pricing pressures actions taken by our competitors and other competitive factors as well as market acceptance of our new products in specific market segments the availability of sufficient inventory to meet demand and the availability of externally purchased components or materials our future revenue is also dependent on continuing technological advancement including developing and implementing new processes and strategic products as well as the timing of new product introductions sustaining and growing new businesses and integrating and operating any acquired businesses our results could also be affected by adverse effects associated with product defects and errata deviations from published specifications and by litigation or regulatory matters involving intellectual property or stockholder consumer antitrust and other issues 

  

we believe that we have the product offerings facilities personnel and competitive and financial resources for continued business success but future revenue costs gross margins and profits are all influenced by a number of factors including those discussed above all of which are inherently difficult to forecast 

  

status of business outlook and related risk factor statements 

  

we expect that our corporate representatives will from time to time meet privately with investors investment analysts the media and others and may reiterate the forwardlooking statements contained in the “business outlook” section and elsewhere in this form 10k including any such statements that are incorporated by reference in this form 10k at the same time we will keep this form 10k and our thencurrent business outlook publicly available on our investor relations web site wwwintccom the public can continue to rely on the business outlook published on the web site as representing our current expectations on matters covered unless we publish a notice stating otherwise the statements in the business outlook and other forwardlooking statements in this form 10k are subject to revision during the course of the year in our quarterly earnings releases and sec filings our midquarter business updates and at other times 

  

we intend to publish a midquarter business update on march 10 2005 from the close of business on march 4 2005 until publication of the update we will observe a “quiet period” during which the business outlook and other forwardlooking statements first published in our earnings press release on january 11 2005 as reiterated or updated as applicable in this form 10k should be considered historical speaking as of prior to the quiet period only and not subject to update during the quiet period our representatives will not comment on the business outlook or our financial results or expectations 

  

a quiet period operating in similar fashion with regard to the business outlook and our form 10k will begin at the close of business on march 18 2005 and will extend until the day that our next quarterly earnings release is published presently scheduled for april 19 2005 we typically have quiet periods twice each quarter in advance of our earnings release and midquarter business update however the exact timing and duration of those routine quiet periods and any others we utilize from time to time may vary at our discretion

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend   

we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in currency exchange rates interest rates and marketable equity security prices to mitigate these risks we may utilize derivative financial instruments among other strategies we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes all of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial positions at december 25 2004 actual results may differ materially 

  

currency exchange rates we generally hedge currency risks of nonusdollardenominated investments in debt securities with offsetting currency borrowings currency forward contracts or currency interest rate swaps gains and losses on these nonuscurrency investments would generally be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments resulting in negligible net exposure 

  

a substantial majority of our revenue expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars however we do enter into transactions in other currencies primarily the euro and certain other european and asian currencies to protect against reductions in value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates we have established balance sheet and forecasted transaction risk management programs currency forward contracts and currency options are generally utilized in these hedging programs our hedging programs reduce but do not always entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements we considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates of 20 for all currencies could be experienced in the near term such adverse changes after taking into account hedges and offsetting positions would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before taxes of less than 30 million and 10 million at the end of 2004 and 2003 respectively 

  

interest rates the primary objective of our investments in debt securities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk to achieve this objective the returns on our investments in fixed rate debt securities are generally swapped to us dollar liborbased returns we considered the historical volatility of the threemonth libor rate experienced in prior years and the duration of our investment portfolio and determined that it was reasonably possible that an adverse change of 80 basis points 080 approximately 31 of the rate at the end of 2004 could be experienced in the near term a hypothetical 080 increase in interest rates after taking into account hedges and offsetting positions would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our investment securities of approximately 20 million and 10 million as of the end of 2004 and 2003 respectively 

  

marketable equity security prices we have a portfolio of strategic equity investments that includes marketable strategic equity securities and derivative equity instruments such as warrants and options as well as nonmarketable equity investments we invest in companies that develop software hardware and other technologies or provide services supporting our technologies this strategic investment program helps advance our overall goal to be the preeminent supplier of building blocks to the worldwide digital economy our current investment focus areas include enabling mobile wireless devices helping to advance the digital home enhancing the digital enterprise advancing highperformance communications infrastructures and developing the next generation of silicon production technologies our focus areas tend to develop and change over time due to rapid advancements in the technology field 

  

included in trading assets is a portfolio of marketable equity securities held to generate returns that generally offset changes in liabilities related to the equity market risk of certain deferred compensation arrangements due to the offset these securities have been excluded from the following market price sensitivity analysis 

  

to the extent that our marketable portfolio of investments continues to have strategic value we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposure for those securities that we no longer consider strategic we evaluate market and economic factors in our decision on the timing of disposal and whether it is possible and appropriate to hedge the equity market risk as of december 25 2004 the fair value of our portfolio of marketable equity investments and equity derivative instruments including hedging positions was 662 million 

  

to assess the market price sensitivity of our marketable portfolio we analyzed the historical movements over the past several years of hightechnology stock indices that we considered appropriate however our marketable portfolio is substantially concentrated in two companies which will affect the marketable portfolio’s price volatility we currently have an investment in micron technology inc with a fair value of approximately 400 million or 60 of the total marketable portfolio value including equity derivative instruments at december 25 2004 in addition we have an investment in elpida memory inc with a fair value of approximately 212 million or 32 of the total marketable portfolio value including equity derivative instruments at december 25 2004 prior to elpida’s public offering this investment was included in our nonmarketable portfolio and therefore excluded from our 2003 market price sensitivity analysis the investments in micron and elpida are part of our strategy to support the development and supply of dynamic random access memory dram products based on the analysis of the hightechnology stock indices and the historical volatility of micron’s and elpida’s stock as of december 25 2004 we estimated that it was reasonably possible that the prices of the stocks in our portfolio could experience a loss of 45 in the near term 55 as of the end of 2003 

  

assuming a loss of 45 in market prices and after reflecting the impact of hedges and offsetting positions our portfolio could decrease in value by approximately 300 million based on the value of the portfolio as of december 25 2004 assuming a loss of 55 in market prices and after reflecting the impact of hedges and offsetting positions our portfolio could decrease in value by approximately 290 million based on the value of the portfolio as of december 27 2003 the assumed loss percentage used in 2004 is lower than the assumed loss percentage used in 2003 due to the differences in the concentration of investments during each year this estimate is not necessarily indicative of future performance and actual results may differ materially 

  

nonmarketable equity securities our strategic investments in nonmarketable equity securities would also be affected by an adverse movement of equity market prices although the impact cannot be directly quantified such a movement and the related underlying economic conditions would negatively affect the prospects of the companies we invest in their ability to raise additional capital and the likelihood of our being able to realize our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings mergers and private sales these types of investments involve a great deal of risk and there can be no assurance that any specific company will grow or become successful consequently we could lose all or part of our investment at december 25 2004 our strategic investments in nonmarketable equity securities had a carrying amount of 507 million no individual investment in our nonmarketable portfolio was significant as of december 25 2004

we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our “disclosure controls and procedures” disclosure controls as of the end of the period covered by this form 10k the controls evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of management including our ceo and cfo disclosure controls are controls and procedures designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the exchange act such as this form 10k is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the us securities and exchange commission’s sec’s rules and forms disclosure controls are also designed to reasonably assure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including the ceo and cfo as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure our quarterly evaluation of disclosure controls includes an evaluation of some components of our internal control over financial reporting and internal control over financial reporting is also separately evaluated on an annual basis for purposes of providing the management report which is set forth below 

  

the evaluation of our disclosure controls included a review of the controls’ objectives and design the company’s implementation of the controls and the effect of the controls on the information generated for use in this form 10k in the course of the controls evaluation we reviewed identified data errors control problems or acts of fraud and sought to confirm that appropriate corrective actions including process improvements were being undertaken this type of evaluation is performed on a quarterly basis so that the conclusions of management including the ceo and cfo concerning the effectiveness of the disclosure controls can be reported in our periodic reports on form 10q and form 10k many of the components of our disclosure controls are also evaluated on an ongoing basis by our internal audit department and by other personnel in our finance and enterprise services organization the overall goals of these various evaluation activities are to monitor our disclosure controls and to modify them as necessary our intent is to maintain the disclosure controls as dynamic systems that change as conditions warrant 

  

based upon the controls evaluation our ceo and cfo have concluded that subject to the limitations noted in this part ii item 9a as of the end of the period covered by this form 10k our disclosure controls were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our exchange act reports is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the sec and that material information relating to intel and its consolidated subsidiaries is made known to management including the ceo and cfo particularly during the period when our periodic reports are being prepared 

  

management report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

management assessed our internal control over financial reporting as of december 25 2004 the end of our fiscal year management based its assessment on criteria established in internal control–integrated framework issued by the committee of 

  

sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission management’s assessment included evaluation of such elements as the design and operating effectiveness of key financial reporting controls process documentation accounting policies and our overall control environment this assessment is supported by testing and monitoring performed both by our internal audit organization and our finance and enterprise services organization 

  

based on our assessment management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the fiscal year to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we reviewed the results of management’s assessment with the audit committee of our board of directors 

  

our independent registered public accounting firm ernst  young llp audited management’s assessment and independently assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting ernst  young has issued an attestation report concurring with management’s assessment which is included at the end of part ii item 8 of this form 10k 

  

inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

  

the company’s management including the ceo and cfo does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures

intel architecture business 

  

the intel architecture business develops platform solutions based on our microprocessors chipsets and boardlevel products which are optimized for use in the desktop mobile and server market segments the enduser products into which our products are ultimately integrated are determined by our customers and how they choose to meet the specific requirements from end users 

  

   

   

   

net revenue for the intel architecture operating segment made up approximately 87 of our consolidated net revenue in 2003 revenue from sales of microprocessors within the intel architecture operating segment represented approximately 73 of consolidated net revenue in 2003 our microprocessor business generally has followed a seasonal trend however there can be no assurance that this trend will continue for the past five years the company’s sales of microprocessors were higher in the second half of the year primarily due to backtoschool and holiday demand 

  

microprocessors 

  

a microprocessor is the central processing unit cpu of a computer system it processes system data and controls other devices in the system acting as the “brains” of the computer one indicator of microprocessor performance is its clock speed the rate at which its internal logic operates which is measured in units of hertz or cycles processed per second one megahertz mhz equals one million cycles processed per second and one gigahertz ghz equals one billion cycles processed per second other factors affecting computer performance include the amount of memory storage the speed of memory access the microarchitecture design of the cpu and the speed of communication between the cpu and the chipset the memory stored on a chip is measured in bytes with 1024 bytes 

  

index to financial statements equaling a kilobyte kb 1049 million bytes equaling a megabyte mb and 1074 billion bytes equaling a gigabyte gb cache is a memory that can be located directly on the microprocessor permitting quicker access to frequently used data and instructions some of our microprocessors have additional levels of cache second level l2 cache and third level l3 cache to offer higher levels of performance other microprocessor features can also enhance system performance or enduser experience by running software more efficiently for example we currently offer microprocessors with hyperthreading technology ht technology which allows a single processor to handle two sets of instructions simultaneously this capability provides benefits in two ways it helps to run “multithreaded” software which is designed to execute different parts of a program simultaneously or helps to use multiple software programs simultaneously in a multitasking environment to take advantage of the ht technology capability a computer system must have a microprocessor that supports the technology a chipset and bios basic inputoutput system that use the technology and an operating system that includes optimizations for the technology performance will vary depending on the system hardware and software used

manufacturing assembly and test 

  

as of yearend 2003 more than 75 of our wafer manufacturing including microprocessor chipset flash memory and networking silicon fabrication was conducted within the us at our facilities in oregon arizona new mexico massachusetts california and colorado outside the us almost 25 of our wafer manufacturing also including wafer fabrication for microprocessors chipsets flash memory and networking silicon was conducted at our facilities in israel and ireland currently our facilities in israel manufacture primarily chipsets 

  

in 2003 we continued to transition our manufacturing facilities from 200mm 8inch wafers to 300mm 12inch wafers the conversion to 300mm wafers allows for more efficient use of our capital investment in equipment by providing more than twice as many equivalent chips per wafer as 200mm wafers two of our facilities in oregon and new mexico currently manufacture products using 300mm wafers we expect to have three 300mm wafer fabrication facilities by the end of 2004 with the third facility under construction in ireland we also announced plans for two additional facilities in oregon and arizona to start production using 300mm wafers after 2004 however as of yearend 2003 a substantial majority of our microprocessors and chipsets were manufactured on 200mm wafers in arizona oregon israel massachusetts ireland new mexico and california 

  

index to financial statements we also began manufacturing microprocessors on our most advanced 90nanometer a nanometer is one billionth of a meter process technology the next generation beyond our 130nanometer 013micron process technology the 90nanometer process technology is our most advanced highvolume production process featuring structures smaller than the size of a virus the smallest microorganism as we move to each succeeding generation of manufacturing process technology we utilize less space per transistor which enables us to put more transistors on an equivalent size chip decrease the size of the chip or offer an increased number of integrated features which can result in faster microprocessors products that consume less power andor products that cost less to manufacture as of yearend 2003 the majority of our microprocessors and chipsets were manufactured using our 130nanometer process technology 

  

we manufacture flash memory using our 130nanometer process technology primarily in new mexico and also in ireland and california we also manufacture flash memory in colorado using our 180nanometer 018micron technology 

  

we manufacture microprocessor and networkingrelated boardlevel products primarily in malaysia and california we also use subcontractors to manufacture some boardlevel products and systems and purchase certain communications networking products from external vendors primarily in the asiapacific region 

  

we perform a substantial majority of our components assembly and test at facilities in malaysia the philippines costa rica and china in the third quarter of 2003 we announced plans to begin construction on an additional assembly and test facility in chengdu china we plan to continue to invest in new assembly and test technologies and facilities to keep pace with our microprocessor chipset and flash technology improvements to augment capacity in the us as well as internationally we use subcontractors to perform assembly of certain products primarily flash memory chipsets and networking and communications products as well as thirdparty manufacturing services foundries to manufacture wafers for certain components including networking and communications products our performance expectations for business integrity ethics environmental health and safety compliance and employment practices are the same regardless of whether our supplier and subcontractor operations are based in the us or elsewhere 

  

we have thousands of suppliers including subcontractors providing our various materials and service needs we set expectations for supplier performance and reinforce those expectations with periodic assessments we communicate those expectations to our suppliers regularly and work with them to implement improvements when necessary we seek where possible to have several sources of supply for all of these materials and resources but we may rely on a single or limited number of suppliers or upon suppliers in a single country in those cases we develop and implement plans and actions to reduce the exposure that would result from a disruption in supply we also typically have multiple factories at various sites around the world producing our products however some products are produced in only one factory and again we seek through other actions and plans to reduce the exposure that would result from a disruption at that factory 

  

manufacturing of integrated circuits is a complex process normal manufacturing risks include errors and interruptions in the production process defects in raw materials and disruptions at suppliers as well as other risks all of which can affect the timing of the manufacturing ramp and yields a substantial decrease in yields would result in higher manufacturing costs and the possibility of not being able to produce sufficient volume to meet specific product demand 

  

we operate globally with sales offices and research and development activities as well as manufacturing and assembly and test facilities in many countries so we are subject to risks and factors associated with doing business outside the us global operations involve inherent risks that include currency controls and fluctuations tariff and import regulations and regulatory requirements that may limit our or our customers’ ability to manufacture assemble and test design develop or sell products in particular countries as part of our siteselection due diligence processes we employ assessments of several criteria which include the property’s physical characteristics or constructability local utility infrastructure transportation capability availability of technical workforce construction and supplier capabilities permitting requirements and investment conditions employment practices and labor rights issues are incorporated in the diligence evaluations also include ratings for security concerns which include corruption terrorism crime and political instability security concerns alone are sufficient to remove projects from consideration regardless of these efforts if terrorist activity armed conflict civil or military unrest or political instability occurs in the us israel or other locations such events may disrupt production logistics security and communications and could also result in reduced demand for intel’s products the impact of major health concerns or of largescale outages or interruptions of service from utility or other infrastructure providers on intel its suppliers customers or other third parties could also adversely affect our business and impact customer order patterns we could also be affected if labor issues disrupt our transportation arrangements or those of our customers or suppliers on a worldwide basis we regularly review our key infrastructure systems services and suppliers both internally and externally to seek to identify significant vulnerabilities as well as areas of potential business impact if a disruptive event were to occur once they are identified we assess the risks and as we consider them to be appropriate we initiate actions intended to reduce the risks and their potential impact however there can be no assurance that we have identified all significant risks or that we can mitigate all identified risks with reasonable effort 

  

index to financial statements we maintain a program of insurance coverage for various types of property casualty and other risks we place our insurance coverage with various carriers in numerous jurisdictions the policies are subject to deductibles and exclusions that result in our retention of a level of risk on a selfinsurance basis the types and amounts of insurance obtained vary from time to time and from location to location depending on availability cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention our worldwide risk and insurance programs are continually evaluated to seek to obtain the most favorable terms and conditions

employees 

  

as of december 27 2003 we employed approximately 79700 people worldwide with approximately 60 of these employees located in the us 

  

sales and marketing 

  

in 2003 we conducted business with more than 2000 direct customers worldwide most of our products are sold or licensed through sales offices located near major concentrations of users primarily throughout the americas europe asiapacific and japan sales agreements typically contain standard terms and conditions covering matters such as pricing payment terms and warranties as well as indemnities for issues specific to our products such as patent and copyright indemnities from time to time we may enter into additional agreements with customers covering for example changes from our standard terms and conditions new product development and marketing privatelabel branding and other matters sales of particular products are generally conducted with purchase orders issued under the sales agreements most of intel’s sales are made using electronic and webbased processes that allow the customer to review inventory availability and to track the progress of specific goods under order pricing on particular products may vary based on volumes ordered and other factors 

  

we sell our products worldwide directly to original equipment manufacturers oems and original design manufacturers odms odms provide design andor manufacturing services to branded and unbranded privatelabel resellers we also sell our products to industrial and retail distributors dell inc contributed approximately 19 to our total sales and hewlettpackard company contributed approximately 15 to our total sales in 2003 a substantial majority of the sales to these customers consisted of intel architecture business products no other customer accounted for more than 10 of our total revenue for the information regarding revenue and operating profit by reportable segments and revenue from unaffiliated customers by geographic regioncountry see “note 22 operating segment and geographic information” in part ii item 8 of this form 10k and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in part ii item 7 of this form 10k 

  

typically distributors handle a wide variety of products including those that compete with our products and fill orders for many customers most of our sales to distributors are made under agreements allowing for price protection on unsold merchandise and a right of return on stipulated quantities of unsold merchandise we also utilize thirdparty sales representatives who generally do not offer directly competitive products but may carry complementary items manufactured by others sales representatives do not maintain a product inventory instead their customers place orders directly with us or through distributors 

  

our worldwide reseller sales channel consists of thousands of indirect customers that are systems builders who purchase intel microprocessors and other products from our distributors these systems builders receive various levels of technical and marketing services and support directly from intel we have a “boxed processor program” that allows distributors to sell intel microprocessors in small quantities to these systemsbuilder customers boxed processors are also made available in direct retail outlets since 1994 our worldwide reseller sales channel has grown substantially and has become increasingly important to our business 

  

our global marketing strategy is designed to associate our brands with advanced technology and innovation under the intel ® brand umbrella the intel inside ® brand is intended to represent technology leadership quality and reliability at the product level the itanium intel xeon pentium celeron and intel centrino brands are part of the intel inside brand family 

  

we promote brand awareness and generate demand through our direct marketing and comarketing programs our direct marketing activities include television print and webbased advertising as well as press relations consumer and trade events and industry and consumer communications in 2003 the primary focus of our direct marketing activities was the intel centrino mobile technology launch with the intel pentium 4 processor with ht technology and other productlevel brands receiving targeted support 

  

index to financial statements purchases by customers often allow them to participate in cooperative advertising and marketing programs such as the intel inside program through the intel inside program oems are licensed to place the intel inside logos on computers with our microprocessors and our other technology and use the brands in advertisements the program includes a market development component that accrues funds based on purchases and partially reimburses the oems for advertisements for products featuring the intel inside brand this program broadens brand reach beyond the scope of our direct advertising 

  

additionally our reseller sales channel marketing programs are intended to extend the intel inside brand reach to channel customers and the businesses and individuals that purchase computer systems from them in 2003 we initiated a program to extend the awareness of our brand outside of the oem and system integrator community as part of the intel centrino mobile technology launch new comarketing programs were initiated with wireless service providers and at public wireless access point locations new comarketing activities with independent system vendors are also under way 

  

our products are typically shipped under terms that transfer title to the customer even in arrangements for which the customer may have a right to return or to exchange the products and the recognition of revenue on the sale is deferred the sales agreements typically provide that payment is due at a later date such as 30 days after shipment delivery or the customer’s use of the product our credit department sets accounts receivable and shipping limits for individual customers for the purpose of controlling credit risk to intel arising from outstanding account balances we assess credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis and from this analysis we establish credit limits and determine whether we will seek to use one or more credit support devices such as obtaining some form of thirdparty guaranty or standby letter of credit or obtaining credit insurance for all or a portion of the account balance credit losses may still be incurred due to bankruptcy fraud or other failure of the customer to pay see “schedule ii—valuation and qualifying accounts” on page 90 of this form 10k for information about our allowance for doubtful receivables 

  

backlog 

  

we do not believe that a backlog as of any particular date is indicative of future results our sales are made primarily pursuant to standard purchase orders for delivery of standard products we have some agreements that give a customer the right to purchase a specific number of products during a specified time period although these agreements do not generally obligate the customer to purchase any particular number of such products some of these agreements do contain billback clauses under these clauses customers who do not purchase the full volume agreed upon are liable for billback on previous shipments up to the price appropriate for the quantity actually purchased as a matter of industry practice billback clauses are difficult to enforce the quantity actually purchased by the customer as well as the shipment schedules are frequently revised during the agreement term to reflect changes in the customer’s needs in light of industry practice and our experience we do not believe that such agreements are meaningful for determining backlog amounts we believe that only a small portion of our order backlog is noncancelable and that the dollar amount associated with the noncancelable portion is not significant 

  

competition 

  

as part of our overall strategy to compete in each relevant market segment we use our core competencies in the design and manufacture of integrated circuits and financial resources as well as our global presence and brand recognition also under our intel capital program we make equity investments in companies around the world to further our strategic objectives and support our key business initiatives our products compete to various degrees on the basis of performance quality features that enhance user experience brand recognition price and availability our ability to compete also depends upon our ability to provide worldwide support for our customers rapid technological advances characterize the computing and communications industries and our ability to compete depends on our ability to improve our products and processes faster than our competitors anticipate changing customer requirements and develop and launch new products to meet changing requirements while reducing our costs at the same time our products compete with products developed for similar or rival architectures and with products based on the same or rival technology standards our competitors also routinely add features to their products seek to increase the performance of their products andor sell their products at lower prices over time we cannot predict whether our products will continue to compete successfully with existing rival architectures andor whether new architectures will establish or gain broad acceptance or increase competition with our products we also cannot predict which competing technology standards will become the prevailing standards in the market segments in which we compete 

  

in the semiconductor industry as unit volumes grow production experience is accumulated and costs decrease further competition develops and as a result prices decline rapidly the life cycle of our products is very short sometimes less than a year many companies compete with us in the various computing networking and communications market segments and are engaged in the same basic fields of activity including research and development worldwide these competitors range in size from large established 

  

index to financial statements multinational companies with multiple product lines to smaller companies and new entrants to the marketplace that compete in specialized market segments in some cases our competitors are also our customers andor suppliers some competitors have integrated operations including their own manufacturing facilities while other competitors perform certain functions themselves and outsource design manufacturing andor other functions competitors who outsource their manufacturing can significantly reduce their capital expenditures 

  

with the trend toward convergence in computing and communications products product offerings will likely cross over into multiple categories offering us new opportunities but also resulting in more businesses that compete with us competition tends to increase pricing pressure on our products which may mean that we must offer our products at lower prices than we had anticipated resulting in lower profits in markets where our competitors have established products and brand recognition it may be inherently difficult for us to compete against them when we believe it is appropriate we will take various steps including introducing new products discontinuing older products reducing prices and offering rebates and other incentives in order to increase acceptance of our latest products and to be competitive within each relevant market segment 

  

most of our products including all of our intel architecture microprocessors and chipsets are built in our own manufacturing facilities although a substantial portion of icg’s manufacturing is performed by thirdparty manufacturers we believe that our network of manufacturing facilities and assemblytest facilities gives us a competitive advantage this network enables us to have more direct control over our processes quality control product cost volume and timing of production and other factors these types of facilities are very expensive and many of our competitors do not own such facilities because they cannot afford to do so or because their business models involve the use of thirdparty facilities for manufacturing and assemblytest these “fabless semiconductor companies” include broadcom corporation nvidia corporation qualcomm incorporated and via technologies inc some of our competitors own portions of such facilities through investment or jointventure arrangements with other companies there is a group of thirdparty manufacturing and assemblytest companies foundries that offer their services to companies without owned facilities or companies needing additional capacity these foundries may also offer intellectual property design services and other goods and services to our competitors 

  

many of our competitors are licensed to use our patents and we are licensed to use their patents through various crosslicensing agreements some competitors have broad licenses with us and under current case law such licenses permit these competitors to pass our patent rights on to others if one of these licensees becomes a foundry our competitors might be able to avoid our patent rights in manufacturing competing products 

  

we plan to continue to cultivate new businesses and work with the computing communications and consumer electronics industries through standards bodies trade associations oems odms and independent software and operating system vendors to align the industry to offer products that take advantage of the latest market trends and usage models these efforts include helping to create the infrastructure for wireless network connectivity we are also working with the industry to develop software applications and operating systems that take advantage of our microprocessors chipsets and other nextgeneration semiconductor devices with higher performance or advanced features including advanced technology capabilities integrated at the silicon level we frequently participate in industry initiatives designed to discuss and agree upon technical specifications and other aspects of technologies that could be adopted as standards by standardssetting organizations our competitors may also participate in the same initiatives and our participation does not ensure that any standards or specifications adopted by these organizations will be consistent with our product planning participation in such initiatives may require us to license our patents to other companies that adopt the standards or specifications even when such organizations do not adopt standards or specifications proposed by intel any intel patents implicated by our participation in such initiatives might not be available for us to enforce against others who might be infringing those patents 

  

we compete globally in all of the market segments in which we offer products we cannot be assured that the patents and licenses on our products will be honored in all regions as various geographies become more significant to our business we cannot be sure of the scope of intellectual property rights that will be granted to us or to third parties with whom we do not have licenses thus we have no assurance about the scope of rights that we can enforce against others in various geographies where our business is growing or the rights that they can assert against us in addition in certain regions governments may adopt regulations or courts may render decisions requiring compulsory licensing of intellectual property to others or requiring that products meet specified standards that serve to favor local companies negatively impacting intel’s ability to achieve an economic return for its innovation and investment 

  

index to financial statements intel architecture business 

  

for the desktop platform our strategy is to introduce microprocessors and chipsets with higher performance andor advanced technology features tailored to the needs of different market segments using a tiered branding approach for the mobile platform our strategy is to deliver products optimized for some or all of the four mobility vectors performance battery life form factor and wireless connectivity for the enterprise platform our strategy is to provide processors and chipsets with high performance andor advanced technology features as well as competitive price for performance for entrylevel to highend servers and workstations 

  

our financial results are substantially dependent on microprocessor sales by the intel architecture operating segment many of our competitors including advanced micro devices inc amd our primary microprocessor competitor market softwarecompatible products that are intended to compete with intel architecturebased processors we also face competition from companies offering rival microprocessor designs such as international business machines corporation ibm which supplies microprocessors to apple computer inc amd has introduced microprocessor product offerings for the desktop and server market segments that are based on 32bit architecture with 64bit memory address extensions microprocessors with 64bit addressing capability can address significantly more memory than 32bit microprocessors we currently have desktop and server microprocessor product offerings based on our ia32 architecture and we offer the intel itanium processor family based on 64bit architecture for enterpriseclass servers and supercomputing solutions we believe that the features of the itanium architecture including highend performance scalability 64bit addressing and reliability provide capabilities that users in this market segment require we plan to introduce intel xeon processors based on the ia32 architecture with 64bit extension technology for workstations and servers in mid2004 we continuously evaluate all of our product offerings and the timing of their introduction taking into account factors such as customer requirements availability of infrastructure to take advantage of product features and maturity of applications software for each type of processor in the relevant market segments any decision to make microprocessors with 64bit extension technology available in the desktop or other market segments will be based on both timing of availability of the infrastructure including an operating system geared toward consumers required to support them and demand for these processors from our oem customers 

  

competitive product offerings continue to increase in the market segments where we have product offerings our desktop processors compete with products offered by amd ibm and via among others our mobile microprocessor products compete with products offered by amd ibm transmeta corporation and via among others our server processors compete with softwarecompatible products offered by amd and with established products based on rival architectures including those offered by hewlettpackard company ibm and sun microsystems inc our chipsets compete in the various market segments against different types of chipsets that support either our microprocessor products or rival microprocessor products competing chipsets are produced by companies such as ati technologies inc broadcom nvidia silicon integrated systems corporation sis and via we also compete with companies offering graphics components and other specialpurpose products used in the desktop mobile and server market segments one aspect of our business model is to incorporate higher performance and advanced features into the microprocessor and chipset the demand for which may increasingly be affected by competition from companies such as nvidia and ati whose business models are based on incorporating performance and advanced features into chipsets and other components such as graphics controllers 

  

intel communications group 

  

within icg our strategy is to be the leading supplier of silicon and integrated networking and communications building blocks for oems and other systems builders we are developing products that we believe will help to build out the internet products designed for wired and wireless connectivity communications infrastructure and networked storage in these areas we face competition from both established and emerging companies our products currently compete against offerings from companies such as applied micro circuits corporation broadcom globespan virata inc ibm marvell technology co ltd and texas instruments incorporated intel and many of our competitors acquire alternative technologies and products from other companies in an effort to achieve leadingedge market segment positions certain market segments in which icg may compete such as networking and telecommunications products have experienced an overall economic decline these market conditions have resulted in increased competition for the remaining available business opportunities we cannot predict whether our networking and communications products will continue to compete successfully with those of our existing competitors or new market entrants 

  

index to financial statements wireless communications and computing group 

  

within wccg our current products include flash memory application and cellular processors based on the intel xscale microarchitecture and cellular baseband chipsets in our various market segments our products currently compete with the products of other companies such as fasl llc a joint venture between fujitsu limited and amd qualcomm samsung semiconductor inc st microelectronics group and texas instruments the megabit demand of the products that make use of flash memory is increasing and our nor flash memory products may face increased competition from companies that manufacture nand flash products as oems may look for opportunities to use nand flash products with additional random access memory or in combination with nor flash memory for executablecode applications various digital cellular technologies are used throughout the cellular communications industry including but not limited to gsm global system for mobile communications gprs general packet radio service cdma code division multiple access and wcdma wideband cdma our ability to compete successfully with our cellular baseband chipsets is dependent on having products available for the most prevalent or widely adopted digital cellular technology our current product offerings are for use in cell phones and pdas that incorporate the gsmgprs cellular technologies our products planned for release in 2004 will be targeted for the wcdma as well as gsmgprs cellular technologies 

  

   

our continued emphasis on research and development rd has enabled us to be a leader in our industry particularly in the area of the design and manufacture of integrated circuits much of our rd efforts have been centered on accelerating the convergence of computing and communications primarily through silicon integration as well as through industry collaboration enabling us to deliver leadingedge technologies and permitting our customers to commit to the use of these new technologies in the development and expansion of their own product offerings specifically our rd activities are directed toward developing new siliconlevel products and architectures advanced computing communications and wireless technologies and new manufacturing packaging and testing processes as well as improving existing products and lowering costs in addition we believe we are well positioned in the technology industry to help drive innovation foster collaboration and promote industry standards that will yield innovative and improved technologies for end users 

  

our rd model is based on a global decentralized organization that emphasizes a collaborative approach in identifying and developing new technologies leading standards initiatives and influencing regulatory policy to accelerate the adoption of new technologies our corporate technology group ctg strives to align our rd initiatives across our business groups to meet our longterm goals in addition ctg works with a decentralized worldwide network of researchers scientists and engineers in the computing and communications fields a decentralized network of technology professionals allows us as well as others in our industry to benefit from development initiatives in a variety of areas eventually leading to innovative technologies for end users we view technology standards as an important way to advance new technologies and foster industry infrastructures or ecosystems we therefore work with industry government and education sectors in various areas to help establish technology standards ultimately incorporating many of these standards into our own product offerings 

  

we perform a substantial majority of our design and development of semiconductor components and other products in the us outside the us we have been increasing our product development activities at various locations including israel malaysia india china and russia we also maintain rd facilities in the us that are focused on developing and improving manufacturing processes as well as facilities in the us malaysia and the philippines that are dedicated to improvements in assembly and test processes 

  

as devices take advantage of converged computing and communications capabilities our goal is to continue to deliver processors with higher performance andor advanced technology features such as ht technology and features offered with our intel centrino mobile technology during 2003 we expanded ht technology from our server product lines to our desktop and mobile transportable product lines we also continued rd activities in support of intel centrino mobile technology in september 2003 we announced our intention to introduce a new mobile platform based on intel centrino mobile technology in the second half of 2004 this new mobile platform is expected to incorporate a future version of the pentium m processor and a new chipset as well as integrate 80211 abg wireless lan capability enabling faster wireless communications and support for industrystandard security solutions 

  

in addition to the multithreading or multitasking capability found in ht technology and the enhanced mobile computing features offered with intel centrino mobile technology we believe that system security reliability and manageability features at the hardware level will provide an enhanced computing experience for end users and we are currently working on new technologies to meet these needs we are designing technology intended to provide future security enhancements for our processors chipsets and platforms this technology when combined with optimized software will help protect against softwarebased attacks on computer systems we are also 

  

index to financial statements designing technology intended to enable multiple independent software environments in a single pc improving the enduser experience by increasing system reliability flexibility and responsiveness as well as speeding the ability to recover from computer crashes 

  

we believe that technologyindustry product developments and the convergence of computing and communications should increase demand for our higher performance enterprise platform products in particular we anticipate increased demand for our products to support new developments in data traffic management storage and wireless computing and communications needs in line with this belief we continued our development initiatives around enterprise platform products and in september 2003 we disclosed details of an upcoming intel xeon processor that will contain a dual core on one chip two microprocessors on the same chip we also plan to make the intel itanium 2 processor available with multiple cores 

  

our leadership in silicon technology has allowed us to continue to help extend “moore’s law” doubling the number of transistors on a chip every couple of years increasing performance while reducing manufacturing costs and also to help expand moore’s law bringing new capabilities into silicon and producing new products optimized for a wider variety of applications we are currently manufacturing microprocessors using the 90nanometer process technology our 90nanometer process technology combines the use of strained silicon and copper interconnects that have integrated advanced materials carbondoped oxide dielectric material by using strained silicon electrical current is able to flow more smoothly increasing the speed of transistors the copper interconnects integrated with these advanced materials allow for increased signal speed and reduced power consumption we also continue to work on incorporating communications capabilities into our 90nanometer manufacturing process these capabilities include the use of highspeed transistors and “mixedsignal” circuitry aimed at producing faster more integrated and less costly communications chips in 2003 we announced plans to convert and build manufacturing facilities to begin development of our nextgeneration 65nanometer manufacturing process we expect to begin manufacturing products using 65nanometer process technology in 2005 

  

we also have rd initiatives in other wireless networking and communications product areas for wireless devices we have development projects surrounding the intel pca architecture the intel pca architecture is our development blueprint for designing wireless handheld communications devices that combine voice communications and internet access capabilities development initiatives around intel pca include processor design based on the intel xscale technology digital signal processing core development improved packaging formats and other communications intellectual property in the longer term our wireless rd efforts are anticipated to encompass a wide array of activities ranging from rf radio frequency circuit and adaptive radio architecture designs to global communications standards advocacy and regulatory policy reform these efforts seek to help make wireless connectivity ubiquitous by integrating radio capability into our processors and chipsets 

  

for networking and communications products we have focused our development efforts on wireless technologies based on new generations of 80211 industry standards and these efforts have led to higher performance ethernet connectivity products we are working to develop silicon based on the ieee 80216d standard also called wimax which is a wireless broadband access technology that links wlanwifi hotspots provides broadband wireless connectivity to businesses and homes and is expected to enable broadband wireless access as an alternative to existing “last mile” methods such as cable and digital subscriber lines dsl we also have development initiatives focusing on 80211n a nextgeneration wlan technology that is expected to enable approximately three times the performance of current 80211 solutions finally our efforts in network and communications initiatives have led to higher performance network processors based on the intel xscale technology modular communications building blocks that reduce development costs and time for network systems developers and standardized optical components and modules for reduced power consumption and cost 

  

in addition we are working to bring advanced silicon technologies to consumer electronics we are currently developing a new technology based on a technique called liquid crystal on silicon lcos lcos is used to create small chips called microdisplays that produce images that are displayed on largescreen rearprojection televisions 

  

our rd on both processes and products may involve currentgeneration activities as well as development of process and product roadmaps extending into the future for successive generations our manufacturing process work particularly for future process technology generations typically involves substantial experimentation invention and evaluation relating to numerous aspects of manufacturing capability to varying degrees these efforts rely on the work of third parties such as university researchers and manufacturers of semiconductor factory equipment our process development work may involve alternative and competing technologies and for technological or other business reasons not all of our efforts will result in technology that we deploy in our manufacturing operations 

  

from time to time we may terminate product development before completion or decide not to manufacture and sell a developed product we do not expect that all of our product development projects will result in products that are ultimately released for sale for a 

  

index to financial statements variety of reasons we may decide not to move forward with a particular product for example we may decide that the product might not be sufficiently competitive in the relevant market segment or for technological or marketing reasons we may decide to offer a different product instead our products often incorporate features that will only increase the product’s performance or be otherwise useful to the end user if other companies have developed operating systems other software applications or other hardware that take advantage of these features we continue to work with other hardware and software companies and industry groups to encourage the development of product offerings designed to take advantage of our products’ features 

  

we continue our commitment to invest in leadingedge technology development our expenditures for rd were 4360 million in fiscal 2003 4034 million in fiscal 2002 and 3796 million in fiscal 2001 additionally we incurred charges for purchased inprocess rd related to acquisitions of 5 million for fiscal 2003 20 million for fiscal 2002 and 198 million for fiscal 2001 while we held the total number of employees flat we increased the number of our employees engaged in rd to approximately 23000 at december 2003 compared to approximately 21000 at december 2002 

  

acquisitions and strategic investments 

  

the level of new acquisition and strategic investment activity for 2003 and 2002 was substantially lower than in prior years during 2003 we completed one acquisition for total consideration of 21 million we also acquired one developmentstage operation in exchange for total consideration of approximately 40 million 

  

under our intel capital program we make equity investments in companies around the world to further our strategic objectives and support our key business initiatives the intel capital program focuses on investing in companies and initiatives to stimulate growth in the internet economy and its infrastructure create new business opportunities for intel and expand global markets for our products the investments may support among other things intel product initiatives emerging trends in the technology industry or worldwide internet deployment this strategic investment program helps advance our overall mission to be the preeminent supplier of building blocks to the worldwide internet economy many of our investments are in private companies including developmentstage companies with little or no revenue from current product offerings 

  

we invest in companies that develop software hardware and other technologies or provide services supporting our technologies our current investment focus areas include enabling mobile and internet client devices helping to create the digital home advancing highperformance communications infrastructures and developing the next generation of silicon production technologies our focus areas tend to develop and change over time due to rapid advancements in technology 

  

intellectual property and licensing 

  

intellectual property rights that apply to our various products and services include patents copyrights trade secrets trademarks and maskwork rights we maintain an active program to protect our investment in technology by enforcing our intellectual property rights the extent of the legal protection given to different types of intellectual property rights varies under different countries’ legal systems we intend to license our intellectual property rights broadly where we can obtain adequate consideration see “competition” in part i item 1 of this form 10k 

  

we have filed and obtained a number of patents in the us and abroad while our patents are an important element of our success our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any one patent we and other companies in the computing telecommunications and related hightechnology fields typically apply for and receive in the aggregate thousands of patents annually in the us and other countries we believe that the duration of the applicable patents we are granted is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products because of the fast pace of innovation and product development our products are often obsolete before the patents related to them expire and sometimes are obsolete before the patents related to them are even granted as we expand our product offerings into new industries such as consumer electronics we extend our patent development efforts to patent such product offerings established competitors in these industries may already have patents covering similar products and while our patents in adjacent technology areas may serve to deter some claims of infringement there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain patents covering our own products or that we will be able to obtain cross licenses from such competitors on favorable terms or at all 

  

the software embedded in our component and systemlevel products is entitled to copyright protection under some circumstances we may require our customers to obtain a software license before we provide them with that software 

  

to distinguish genuine intel products from our competitors’ products we have obtained certain trademarks and trade names for our products and we maintain cooperative advertising programs with oems to promote our brands and identify products containing genuine intel components 

  

index to financial statements we also protect certain details about our processes products and strategies as trade secrets keeping confidential the information that we believe provides us with a competitive advantage we have ongoing programs designed to maintain the confidentiality of such information 

  

our ability to enforce our patents copyrights software licenses and other intellectual property is subject to general litigation risks as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of various intellectual property rights in various countries when we seek to enforce our rights we are often subject to claims that the intellectual property right is invalid is otherwise not enforceable or is licensed to the party against whom we are asserting a claim in addition our assertion of intellectual property rights often results in the other party seeking to assert alleged intellectual property rights of its own against us like many companies in the semiconductor and other hightechnology industries we receive claims that we may be infringing others’ intellectual property rights in addition our sales agreements often contain intellectual property indemnities such as patent and copyright indemnities and our customers may assert claims against us for indemnity when they receive claims alleging that our customers’ products infringe others’ intellectual property rights when we receive such claims we refer them to our counsel and current claims are in various stages of evaluation and negotiation if we determine that it is necessary or desirable we may seek licenses for certain intellectual property rights however we can give no assurance that we will be able to obtain licenses from any claimant or that we can accept the terms of any offered licenses further we are not able to resolve every dispute without litigation which is typically timeconsuming and expensive if we are not ultimately successful in defending ourselves against these claims in litigation we may not be able to sell a particular product or family of products due to an injunction or we may have to pay material amounts of damages see also the information under the heading “legal proceedings” in part i item 3 of this form 10k

deanna neubauer et al v intel corporation gateway inc hewlettpackard co and hpdirect inc 

third judicial circuit court madison county illinois 

  

in june 2002 various plaintiffs filed a lawsuit in the third judicial circuit court madison county illinois against intel hewlettpackard company hpdirect inc and gateway inc alleging that the defendants’ advertisements and statements misled the public by suppressing and concealing the alleged material fact that systems that use the intel ® pentium 4 ® processor are less powerful and slower than systems using the intel ® pentium ® iii processor and a competitor’s processors the plaintiffs claim that their lawsuit should be treated as a nationwide class action the plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and attorneys’ fees and costs the company disputes the plaintiffs’ claims and intends to defend the lawsuit vigorously 

  

c environmental proceedings 

  

intel has been named to the california and us superfund lists for three of our sites and has completed along with two other companies a remedial investigationfeasibility study with the us environmental protection agency epa to evaluate the groundwater in areas adjacent to one of our former sites the epa has issued a record of decision with respect to a groundwater cleanup plan at that site including expected costs of completion under the california and us superfund statutes liability for cleanup of this site and the adjacent area is joint and several the company however has reached agreement with those same two companies that significantly limits the company’s liabilities under the proposed cleanup plan also the company has completed extensive studies at our other sites and is engaged in cleanup at several of these sites in the opinion of management the potential losses to the company in excess of amounts already accrued arising out of these matters would not have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position or overall trends in results of operations even if joint and several liability were to be assessed 

  

the estimate of the potential impact on the financial position or overall results of operations for the above legal and environmental proceedings could change in the future

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend   

we begin management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda with intel’s overall strategy and the strategy for our major business units to give the reader an overview of the goals of our business and the direction in which our business and products are moving this is followed by a discussion of the critical accounting estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results in the next section beginning on page 35 we discuss our results of operations for 2003 compared to 2002 and for 2002 compared to 2001 beginning with an overview we then provide an analysis of changes in our balance sheet and cash flows and discuss our financial commitments in the sections entitled “financial condition” “contractual obligations” and “offbalancesheet arrangements” on page 46 we conclude this mda with our “business outlook” section discussing our outlook for 2004 

  

this mda should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this annual report on form 10k including “item 1 business” “item 6 selected financial data” and “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” the various sections of this mda contain a number of forwardlooking statements all of which are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risk factors described throughout this filing and particularly in the “business outlook” section our actual results may differ materially and these forwardlooking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any divestitures mergers acquisitions or other business combinations that had not been completed as of february 18 2004 

  

strategy 

  

our goal is to be the preeminent building block supplier to the worldwide internet economy as part of our overall strategy to compete in each relevant market segment we use our core competencies and financial resources as well as our global presence and brand recognition our global marketing strategy is designed to associate our brands with advanced technology and innovation in addition under our intel capital program we make equity investments in companies around the world to further our strategic objectives and support our key business initiatives 

  

our primary focus is on developing advanced integrated silicon technology solutions which we believe will provide the performance and technology features necessary to help accelerate the convergence of computing and communications capabilities convergence refers to having computing and communications capabilities in an integrated product solution we also provide key components for networking and communications infrastructures used to connect technology users we believe users of computing and communications devices want not only higher performance but also other capabilities such as multithreaded or multitasking capability seamless networking connectivity improved security reliability ease of use and interoperability among devices it is our goal to incorporate features addressing these capabilities in our various products to meet user demands 

  

each of our operating segments uses its core competencies in the design and manufacture of integrated circuits as well as key silicon and platform capabilities to provide building blocks for technology solutions the intel architecture business provides the advanced technologies to support the desktop mobile and enterprise computing platforms during 2003 our intel communications group icg focused on wired and wireless network connectivity products and provided key components for networking and communications infrastructure devices and other industrial and commercial purposes finally during 2003 our wireless communications and computing group wccg focused on componentlevel products and platform solutions for the wireless handheld communications and computing market segments 

  

as we move to each succeeding generation of manufacturing process technology we use less space per transistor which enables us to fit more transistors on an equivalent size chip decrease the size of the chip or offer an increased number of integrated features this decrease in size can also result in faster microprocessors and semiconductor products that consume less power andor products that cost less to manufacture 

  

in december 2003 we announced that we would be consolidating our communicationsrelated businesses into a single organization the intel communications group we believe that as computing and communications converge the consolidation of icg and wccg will give us the opportunity to better coordinate product planning and customer focus between our communications infrastructure and wireless client efforts going forward this reorganization was not effective until fiscal 2004 because the reporting period for this form 10k is as of december 27 2003 the communicationsrelated businesses discussed below and the results of operations for our operating segments in this mda are presented under the organizational structure that existed as of december 27 2003

critical accounting estimates 

  

the methods estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements which we discuss under the heading “results of operations” following this section of our mda some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain our most critical accounting estimates include the assessment of recoverability of goodwill which impacts goodwill impairments valuation of nonmarketable equity securities which impacts net gains losses on equity securities when we record impairments valuation of inventory which impacts gross margin assessment of recoverability of longlived assets which primarily impacts gross margin when we impair manufacturing assets or accelerate their depreciation and recognition and measurement of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities which impacts our tax provision below we discuss these policies further as well as the estimates and judgments involved we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies such as our policies for revenue recognition including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors however these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting estimates because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 

  

goodwill goodwill is initially recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired we perform an annual review in the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist to determine if the recorded goodwill is impaired our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value including the goodwill related to the reporting unit to determine the fair value our review process uses the income method and is based on a discounted future cash flow approach that uses estimates including the following for the reporting units revenue based on assumed market segment growth rates and intel’s assumed market segment share estimated costs and appropriate discount rates based on the particular business’s weighted average cost of capital our estimates of market segment growth our market segment share and costs are based on historical data various internal estimates and a variety of external sources and are developed as part our routine longrange planning process in addition to being used in our goodwill impairment analysis the same estimates are used in the planning for our longterm manufacturing capacity needs as part of our capital budgeting process and for both longterm and shortterm business planning and forecasting we test the reasonableness of the inputs and outcomes of our discounted cash flow analysis by comparison to available and comparable market data in determining the carrying value of the reporting unit we must include an allocation of our manufacturing assets because of the interchangeable nature of our manufacturing capacity this allocation is based on each reporting unit’s relative percentage of utilization of our manufacturing assets during the fourth quarter of 2003 the company completed its most recent review resulting in a 611 million noncash goodwill impairment charge related to the wccg reporting unit see “note 16 goodwill” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and the wccg discussion in the “results of operations” section of this mda a substantial majority of our remaining recorded goodwill is related to the icg reporting unit the estimates we used in our most recent review for icg assume that we will gain market segment share in the future and that the communications business will experience a gradual recovery and return to growth from the current trends we may incur charges for the impairment of goodwill in the future if the communications sector does not recover as we expect if we fail to deliver new products for icg if the products fail to gain expected market acceptance if we fail to achieve our assumed revenue growth rates or assumed gross margin or if interest rates increase significantly 

  

nonmarketable equity securities at december 27 2003 the carrying value of our portfolio of strategic investments in nonmarketable equity securities excluding equity derivatives totaled 665 million 730 million at december 28 2002 under our intel capital program we make equity investments in companies around the world to further our strategic objectives and support our key business initiatives the intel capital program focuses on investing in companies and initiatives to stimulate growth in the internet economy and its infrastructure create new business opportunities for intel and expand global markets for our products the investments may support among other things intel product initiatives emerging trends in the technology industry or worldwide internet deployment this strategic investment program helps advance our overall mission to be the preeminent supplier of building blocks to the worldwide internet economy 

  

we invest in companies that develop software hardware and other technologies or provide services supporting technologies our current investment focus areas include enabling mobile and internet client devices helping to create the digital home advancing high performance communications infrastructure and developing the next generation of silicon production technologies our focus areas tend to develop and change over time due to rapid advancements in technology

we typically invest in nonmarketable equity securities of private companies and contribute a portion of the funds required for them to grow our investment portfolio ranges from earlystage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies whose products or technologies may directly support an intel product or initiative we invest for strategic reasons with each investment also evaluated for potential financial returns the program seeks to invest in companies and businesses that can succeed and have an impact on their market segment however these types of investments involve a great deal of risk and there can be no assurance that any specific company whether at an early or mature stage or somewhere in between will grow or will become successful and consequently we could lose all or part of our investment when the strategic objectives of an investment have been achieved or if the investment or business diverges from our strategic objectives we may decide to dispose of the investment however our investments in nonmarketable equity securities are not liquid and there can be no assurance that we will be able to dispose of these investments on favorable terms or at all 

  

as of december 27 2003 we had invested 124 million in nonvoting stock of elpida memory inc a japanese provider of dynamic random access memory dram this investment is intended to help align elpida’s product roadmap as appropriate with our roadmap and is part of our investment strategy to support the development and supply of dram products no other investment in our nonmarketable portfolio was individually significant 

  

our ability to recover our strategic investments in nonmarketable equity securities and to earn a return on these investments is primarily dependent on how successfully these companies are able to execute to their business plans and how well their products are accepted as well as their ability to obtain venture capital funding to continue operations to grow and to take advantage of liquidity events in the current equity market environment their ability to obtain additional funding as well as to take advantage of liquidity events such as initial public offerings ipos mergers and private sales remains constrained 

  

we review all of our investments quarterly for impairment however for nonmarketable equity securities the impairment analysis requires significant judgment to identify events or circumstances that would likely have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment the indicators that we use to identify those events or circumstances include a the investee’s revenue and earnings trends relative to predefined milestones and overall business prospects b the technological feasibility of the investee’s products and technologies c the general market conditions in the investee’s industry and d the investee’s liquidity debt ratios and the rate at which the investee is using its cash 

  

investments identified as having an indicator of impairment are subject to further analysis to determine if the investment is other than temporarily impaired in which case we write the investment down to its impaired value when an investee is not considered viable from a financial or technological point of view we write down the entire investment since we consider the estimated fair market value to be nominal if an investee obtains additional funding at a valuation lower than our carrying amount or requires a new round of equity funding to stay in operation and the new funding does not appear imminent we presume that the investment is other than temporarily impaired unless specific facts and circumstances indicate otherwise 

  

we have experienced substantial impairments in our portfolio of nonmarketable equity securities as equity markets declined significantly over the past few years if the level of ipo market activity does not increase and the availability of venture capital funding for technology investments does not improve our nonmarketable investments may be adversely affected as companies within our portfolio attempt to raise additional funds the funds may not be available to them or they may receive lower valuations with less favorable investment terms than in previous financings and the investments would likely become impaired however we are not able to determine at the present time which specific investments are likely to be impaired in the future or the extent or timing of individual impairments impairments of investments in our portfolio primarily impairments of nonmarketable equity securities were 319 million in 2003 524 million in 2002 and 11 billion in 2001 

  

inventory the valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality the determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products within specific time horizons generally six months or less the estimates of future demand that we use in the valuation of inventory are the basis for our published revenue forecast which is also consistent with our shortterm manufacturing plan if our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly we could be required to record additional inventory reserves which would have a negative impact on our gross margin 

  

index to financial statements management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

continued 

  

longlived assets we assess the impairment of longlived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant underperformance of a business or product line in relation to expectations significant negative industry or economic trends and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets recoverability of assets that will continue to be used in our operations is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to the related total future net cash flows if an asset grouping’s carrying value is not recoverable through the related cash flows the asset grouping is considered to be impaired the impairment is measured by the difference between the asset grouping’s carrying amount and its fair value based on the best information available including market prices or discounted cash flow analysis 

  

impairments of longlived assets are determined for groups of assets related to the lowest level of identifiable independent cash flows due to our asset usage model and the interchangeable nature of our semiconductor manufacturing capacity we must make subjective judgments in determining the independent cash flows that can be related to specific asset groupings in addition as we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions we must make subjective judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets primarily processspecific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements when we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated and there are sufficient cash flows to support the carrying value of the assets we accelerate the rate of depreciation charges in order to fully depreciate the assets over their new shorter useful lives 

  

income taxes we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 

  

we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets if recovery is not likely we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable as of december 27 2003 we believed that all of the deferred tax assets recorded on our balance sheet would ultimately be recovered however should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determine that the recovery is not probable 

  

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due if we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary we record an additional charge in our provision for taxes in the period in which we determine that the recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be for a discussion of current tax matters see “note 21 contingencies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements

results of operations 

  

overview 

  

in 2003 we saw a substantial improvement in our intel architecture business compared to 2002 and as we look ahead to the rest of 2004 we are planning for growth in annual revenue and further progress in overall gross profit margin our growth continues to be largely dependent on the success of our microprocessor business revenue from sales of microprocessors within our intel architecture business represented approximately 73 of our consolidated net revenue in 2003 rapid technological advances characterize the semiconductor industry therefore we must continue to deliver leadingedge products that appeal to users of technology by integrating higher performance andor added features into our products in addition growth in sales of microprocessors is dependent on continued sales growth in emerging markets in both asia and europe which have been growing faster on a percentage basis than our other regions in 2003 72 of our sales came from geographies outside of the americas finally growth in sales of microprocessors depends on continued business and consumer investment in technologies that use our microprocessors in mature markets 

  

we plan to continue to streamline operations and refocus on core strategic areas within our communicationsrelated businesses in line with this effort in december 2003 we announced that we would be consolidating communicationsrelated businesses within icg and wccg into a single organization the intel communications group effective for 2004 we believe that as wireless lan and cellular technologies come together the combination of these organizations gives us the opportunity to better coordinate product planning and customer focus the losses in our flash memory business have been disappointing however we intend to use leading technology products and manufacturing processes to turn this business around in addition our networking business has experienced the negative effect of an overall decline in the telecommunications industry in the last few years however we have been cutting costs and trimming the losses in this business and believe that this market segment will eventually improve 

  

sustaining or growing our profitability depends on our ability to obtain continuing benefits from the productive use of our manufacturing assets in particular our new equipment used for 90nanometer process technology and 300mm wafers as we build more of our mainstream products with these technologies we consider our manufacturing capability to be a competitive advantage and our success is dependent on our continued ability to lower our unit costs through manufacturing efficiencies because we have high fixed costs our profitability could be negatively affected if we do not achieve sufficient salesvolume growth despite the economic downturn of the last few years we continued to and currently plan to continue to invest in capital equipment and increase research and development spending with the goal of delivering leadingedge products on advanced manufacturing processes 

  

the following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of income data as a percentage of net revenue for the periods indicated

the following table sets forth information on our geographic regions for the periods indicated 

  

   

our net revenue for 2003 was 301 billion an increase of 13 compared to 2002 this increase in net revenue was primarily from our intel architecture business which had increased sales of microprocessors and chipsets accompanied by slightly higher net revenue for icg net revenue was lower for wccg 

  

our asiapacific region’s revenue made up the largest portion of our total revenue and increased 21 in 2003 compared to 2002 reflecting growth in local consumption and asia’s continued growth as a global manufacturing and design center revenue in europe improved increasing 12 in 2003 compared to 2002 japan experienced substantial improvement with increased revenue of 42 primarily driven by retail sales as well as higher notebook exports by japanese manufacturers revenue from the americas region continued to decrease as a percent of our total revenue and declined 3 in 2003 compared to 2002 in 2003 we continued to experience growth in emerging markets in asia and europe and began to see some evidence of higher technology infrastructure spending in mature markets in europe and the us 

  

our overall gross margin percentage increased to 567 for 2003 from 498 in 2002 improved gross margin within the intel architecture business as well as a shift in the total company revenue mix to the higher margin intel architecture business contributed to our improved total gross margin improvement in the intel architecture gross margin was partially offset by a decline in the gross margin percentage for wccg the gross margin percentage for icg was flat in 2003 compared to 2002 see the “business outlook” section below for a discussion of gross margin expectations 

  

our net revenue for 2002 was 268 billion approximately flat compared to 265 billion in 2001 increased revenue in the intel architecture business due to strength in sales of microprocessors and chipsets was offset by significantly lower revenue for icg net revenue for wccg was flat from 2001 to 2002 

  

in 2002 revenue from our asiapacific region increased 21 from 2001 and surpassed revenue from the americas for the first time the growth in asia was offset by declines in our other geographies japan declined 19 due to weakened economic conditions the americas region decreased 8 and europe decreased 6 

  

our overall gross margin percentage in 2002 was approximately flat at 498 compared to 492 in 2001 the intel architecture business gross margin percentage was also relatively flat in 2002 compared to 2001 wccg experienced a slightly lower gross margin percentage while icg experienced a slightly higher gross margin percentage our gross margin percentage in 2002 was also negatively impacted by the 106 million charge related to the decision to wind down our web hosting business

intel architecture business 

  

the revenue and operating income for the intel architecture operating segment for the three years ended december 27 2003 were as follows 

  

   

net revenue for the intel architecture operating segment increased by 38 billion or 17 in 2003 compared to 2002 revenue from sales of microprocessors increased 17 while revenue from sales of chipsets and motherboards increased 16 the increase in intel architecture revenue was primarily due to significantly higher unit sales and to a lesser extent due to a slightly higher average selling price for microprocessors as well as significantly higher unit sales of chipsets in 2003 during the year we rapidly ramped the new intel centrino mobile technology and the pentium m processor for mobile computers we also saw increased sales of pentium 4 processors with ht technology and higher sales of intel xeon processors in the server market segment 

  

operating income increased by 38 billion or 58 in 2003 compared to 2002 the increase was primarily due to the impact of higher revenue lower unit costs for microprocessors and chipsets and charges for underutilized factory capacity that were lower than in 2002 by approximately 150 million these improvements were partially offset by approximately 390 million of higher startup costs in 2003 related to the ramp of 90nanometer technology on 300millimeter wafer manufacturing 

  

for 2002 net revenue for the intel architecture operating segment increased by 870 million or 4 compared to 2001 revenue from sales of microprocessors increased 4 and revenue from sales of chipsets and motherboards increased 3 the increase in microprocessor revenue was primarily due to higher unit volumes partially offset by lower average selling prices the increase in revenue from chipsets and motherboards was primarily due to significantly higher unit volumes of motherboards 

  

operating income for the intel architecture business increased by 315 million or 5 in 2002 compared to 2001 the increase was primarily due to the impact of higher revenue and approximately 720 million of lower startup costs related to the 013micron technology manufacturing ramp these positive impacts were partially offset by higher unit costs for microprocessors operating income for 2002 was reduced by a 155 million charge related to the intergraph corporation litigation settlement agreement see “note 21 contingencies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements

net revenue increased by 67 million or 3 in 2003 compared to 2002 revenue increased for wireless connectivity products including the wireless component of our intel centrino mobile technology and for embedded processing components these increases were partially offset by lower revenue from sales of telecommunicationsrelated board products and lower revenue from wired ethernet connectivity products due to the continuing shift in product mix to lan on motherboard products 

  

the operating loss decreased to 426 million in 2003 from a 622 million loss in 2002 primarily due to a decrease in operating expenses of 194 million in 2003 as we continued our efforts to streamline operations and refocus on our core strategic areas in addition operating results improved due to higher revenue from sales of embedded processing components and lower unit costs of microcontrollers these improvements were partially offset by the mix shift to lower margin wired ethernet connectivity products finally in the current competitive environment sales of wireless connectivity products in support of expanded adoption of intel centrino mobile technology increased the operating loss in 2003 

  

for 2002 net revenue decreased by 500 million or 19 compared to 2001 primarily due to lower overall unit volumes for telecommunicationsrelated products consistent with the decline in industrywide demand for these products in addition net revenue for wired ethernet connectivity products decreased even as units increased due to the shift in product mix from adapter cards to lan on motherboard products 

  

despite the decline in net revenue for icg 2002 net operating results improved with a loss of 622 million compared to a loss of 735 million in 2001 the impact of lower revenue was more than offset by the impact of operating expenses which were lower by approximately 137 million as well as by reduced inventory writedowns in 2002 compared to 2001 and a mix shift to higher margin products including embedded processing components 

  

wireless communications and computing group 

  

the revenue and operating loss for the wccg operating segment for the three years ended december 27 2003 were as follows 

  

   

net revenue decreased by 382 million or 17 in 2003 compared to 2002 due to lower unit sales of flash memory products in 2003 revenue for flash memory products was negatively affected by lost business as a result of the pricing strategy on certain products revenue from sales of application processors for dataenabled cellular phones and handheld computing devices increased 

  

the operating loss increased by 145 million to a loss of 432 million in 2003 compared to a loss of 287 million in 2002 primarily due to lower revenue for flash memory products and the impact of higher inventory writeoffs 

  

net revenue was flat from 2001 to 2002 revenue for flash memory products was slightly lower due to a decrease in average selling prices stemming from competitive pricing pressures mostly offset by an increase in unit volumes revenue on higher volumes of application processors and baseband chipsets offset the lower revenue from flash memory products 

  

the net operating loss increased by 38 million to a loss of 287 million in 2002 compared to a loss of 249 million in 2001 lower average selling prices in 2002 for flash memory products were partially offset by the impact of charges for underutilized factory capacity that were reduced by approximately 170 million higher revenue and lower costs for application processors and baseband chipsets offset a portion of the negative impact for flash memory products

operating expenses 

  

operating expenses for the three years ended december 27 2003 were as follows 

  

   

research and development spending increased 326 million or 8 in 2003 compared to 2002 and increased 238 million or 6 in 2002 compared to 2001 the increase in 2003 compared to 2002 was primarily due to higher expenses for product development programs in the intel architecture business and higher spending on the development of manufacturing process technologies including the 65nanometer process technology as well as higher profitdependent compensation expenses the increase in 2002 compared to 2001 was primarily due to higher spending on the development of manufacturing process technologies including the 90nanometer process technology 

  

marketing general and administrative expenses were flat in 2003 compared to 2002 we lowered our discretionary spending and other expenses as we reduced headcount and refocused on core strategic areas this decrease in expenses was offset by higher marketing expenses due to the launch of the intel centrino mobile technology brand in 2003 increased profitdependent compensation expenses and higher spending for the intel inside ® cooperative advertising program primarily due to higher microprocessor revenue marketing general and administrative expenses decreased 130 million or 3 in 2002 compared to 2001 primarily due to the impact of lower spending within icg and for certain new business initiatives as we reduced headcount or exited certain businesses as well as lower overall discretionary spending related to cost containment programs the spending decreases were partially offset by higher expenses for the intel inside cooperative advertising program due to higher microprocessor revenue and the impact of our customers using a slightly higher percentage of their available program funds 

  

during the fourth quarter of 2003 the company completed its annual impairment review for goodwill and found indicators of impairment for the wccg reporting unit the wccg business comprised primarily of flash memory products and cellular baseband chipsets has not performed as management had expected in the fourth quarter of 2003 it became apparent that wccg was now expected to grow more slowly than previously projected a slowerthanexpected rollout of products and slowerthanexpected customer acceptance of our products in the baseband chipset business as well as a delay in the transition to nextgeneration phone networks have pushed out the forecasts for sales of products for highend data cell phones these factors resulted in lower growth expectations for the reporting unit and triggered a 611 million charge for impairment of goodwill also during 2003 the company recorded a 6 million charge for impairment of the goodwill related to one of the company’s seed businesses seed businesses support the company’s strategic initiatives in 2001 goodwill of 16 billion was amortized and there was a 98 million charge for goodwill impairment related to prioryear acquisitions beginning in 2002 goodwill is no longer amortized 

  

amortization and impairment of acquisitionrelated intangibles and costs was 301 million in 2003 decreasing from 548 million in 2002 and 628 million in 2001 as intangible assets related to prior acquisitions became fully amortized the 2002 amount included 127 million of impairments 26 million in 2001 no impairments were recorded in 2003 amortization and impairment of both goodwill and acquisitionrelated costs for all periods are included in the calculation of the operating loss for the “all other” category for segment reporting purposes

gains losses on equity securities interest and other and taxes 

  

losses on equity securities net interest and other net and taxes for the three years ended december 27 2003 were as follows 

  

   

losses on equity securities and certain equity derivatives for 2003 were 283 million compared to 372 million for 2002 the net loss for 2003 included impairment charges of approximately 319 million primarily related to nonmarketable equity securities compared to impairment charges of approximately 524 million in 2002 the decrease in the impairment charges in 2003 reflected the decrease in the total carrying amount of the nonmarketable equity investment portfolio the impairment charges in 2002 were partially offset by net gains of approximately 57 million related to equity security trading assets and 110 million of net gains on related equity derivatives the 57 million net gains included a gain of approximately 120 million resulting from the designation of formerly restricted equity investments as trading assets as they became marketable the cumulative difference between their cost and fair market value at the time they became marketable was recorded as a gain in 2002 for 2001 the net loss of 466 million included impairments of 11 billion partially offset by net gains on transactions of 517 million and net marktomarket gains on equity security trading assets and derivatives of 90 million 

  

our effective income tax rate was 242 in 2003 259 in 2002 and 409 in 2001 the decrease in the effective tax rate in 2003 was primarily attributed to tax benefits of 758 million related to divestitures that closed during the year although the pretax losses on the divestitures for financial statement purposes were not significant the company was able to recognize tax losses because the tax basis in the stock of the companies sold exceeded the book basis the impact of these benefits was partially offset by the nondeductible goodwill impairment and a higher percentage of profits in higher tax jurisdictions the decrease in the effective rate in 2002 compared to 2001 was primarily attributed to a decrease in nondeductible acquisitionrelated costs including amortization of goodwill and tax benefits of 75 million related to divestitures during 2002 partially offset by a greater portion of our profits being generated in higher tax jurisdictions see “business outlook” for a discussion of our income tax rate expectations

financial condition 

  

our financial condition remains strong at december 27 2003 cash shortterm investments and fixed income instruments included in trading assets totaled 159 billion up from 122 billion at december 28 2002 at december 27 2003 total shortterm and longterm debt was 12 billion and represented 3 of stockholders’ equity at december 28 2002 total debt was 14 billion and represented 4 of stockholders’ equity 

  

for 2003 cash provided by operating activities was 115 billion compared to 91 billion in 2002 and 88 billion in 2001 cash was provided by net income adjusted for noncashrelated items working capital uses of cash included increases in accounts receivable and inventories and a decrease in income taxes payable accounts receivable increased over december 2002 levels primarily due to higher revenue the days’ sales outstanding also increased to 36 days from 34 days at december 2002 for 2003 our three largest customers accounted for approximately 42 of net revenue with one of these customers accounting for approximately 19 of revenue and another customer accounting for approximately 15 for 2002 our three largest customers accounted for approximately 38 of net revenue 35 of net revenue for 2001 additionally these three largest customers accounted for approximately 43 of net accounts receivable at december 27 2003 approximately 39 at december 28 2002 and december 29 2001 overall inventory levels were higher by 11 at the end of 2003 compared to 2002 as we ramped new products for sale in 2004 the decrease in the accrual for income taxes payable was primarily due to the impact of tax benefits related to divestitures in the fourth quarter of 2003 working capital sources of cash included an increase in accrued compensation and benefits largely due to higher accruals for employee bonuses related to our higher level of profitability in 2003 

  

we used 71 billion in net cash for investing activities during 2003 compared to 58 billion during 2002 and 330 million during 2001 the increase in cash generated from operations compared to 2002 resulted in net purchases of availableforsale investments in 2003 improved corporate credit profiles facilitated a slight shift in our portfolio of investments in debt securities to longer term maturities additionally during 2003 we used 450 million in cash to acquire stock rights exchangeable into approximately 339 million shares of micron technology inc capital expenditures decreased to 37 billion in 2003 as we continued to invest in capital equipment and construction primarily for additional microprocessor manufacturing capacity but at a lower rate than in the prior two years capital expenditures were 47 billion in 2002 and 73 billion in 2001 the increase in cash used for investing activities in 2002 compared to 2001 reflected the relatively large net sales and maturities of availableforsale investments that occurred in 2001 

  

we used 39 billion in net cash for financing activities in 2003 relatively flat compared to the prior year which had been up slightly compared to 2001 the major financing use of cash in all three years was for the repurchase of shares in 2003 we purchased 176 million shares of common stock for 4 billion 4 billion in 2002 and 2001 at december 27 2003 approximately 414 million shares remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization another major financing use of cash in all three years was for the payment of dividends payment of dividends was 524 million in 2003 533 million in 2002 and 538 million in 2001 in january 2004 our board of directors approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend from 002 per share to 004 per share effective for the firstquarter 2004 dividend financing sources of cash during 2003 were primarily 967 million in proceeds from the sale of shares pursuant to employee stock benefit plans 681 million in 2002 and 762 million in 2001 

  

another potential source of liquidity is authorized borrowings including commercial paper of 3 billion maximum borrowings under our commercial paper program during 2003 were approximately 30 million although no commercial paper was outstanding at the end of the period we also maintain the ability to issue an aggregate of approximately 14 billion in debt equity and other securities under us securities and exchange commission shelf registration statements 

  

we believe that we have the financial resources needed to meet business requirements for the next 12 months including capital expenditures for the expansion or upgrading of worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test capacity working capital requirements the dividend program potential stock repurchases and potential future acquisitions or strategic investments

contractual obligations 

  

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at december 27 2003 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods this table excludes amounts already recorded on our balance sheet as current liabilities at december 27 2003 

  

   

   

   

   

   

purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements for the purposes of this table contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on intel and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months we also enter into contracts for outsourced services however the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 

  

contractual obligations that are contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones are not included in the table above these include contingent joint funding obligations milestonebased equity investment funding and acquisitionrelated deferred cash compensation contingent on future employment these arrangements are not considered contractual obligations until the milestone is met by the third party as of december 27 2003 assuming all future milestones were met additional required payments would be approximately 60 million 

  

the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations amounts disclosed as contingent or milestonebased obligations are dependent on the achievement of the milestones or the occurrence of the contingent events and can vary significantly 

  

offbalancesheet arrangements 

  

as of december 27 2003 we did not have any significant offbalancesheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk

employee stock options 

  

our stock option program is a broadbased longterm retention program that is intended to attract and retain talented employees and align stockholder and employee interests the program currently consists of two plans one under which officers key employees and nonemployee directors may be granted options to purchase shares of our stock 1984 plan and a broadbased plan under which options may be granted to all employees other than officers and directors 1997 plan substantially all of our employees participate in one of the plans options granted by the company expire no later than 10 years from the grant date during 2003 options granted to existing and newly hired employees generally vest in increments over four or five years from the date of grant and certain grants to key employees have delayed vesting generally beginning six years from the date of grant our 1984 stock option plan as amended expires in may 2004 and our 1997 stock option plan as amended expires in january 2007 we presently expect to propose a new equity plan for stockholder vote at our may 2004 annual stockholders’ meeting contingent on stockholder approval this new equity plan would replace both the expiring 1984 plan and the 1997 plan which would be terminated early 

  

we have a goal to keep the potential incremental dilution related to our option program to a longterm average of less than 2 annually the dilution percentage is calculated using the new option grants for the year net of options forfeited by employees leaving the company and options expired divided by the total outstanding shares at the beginning of the year 

  

options granted to employees including officers and nonemployee directors from 1999 through 2003 are summarized as follows 

  

   

   

   

   

   

in accordance with a policy established by the compensation committee of the board of directors total options granted to the listed officers may not exceed 5 of total options granted in any year during 2003 options granted to listed officers amounted to 24 of the grants made to all employees in 2003 and 2002 in addition to grants made in connection with annual performance reviews we made further grants to key officers including listed officers and other seniorlevel employees in recognition of their future potential in leading the company all stock option grants to executive officers are made after a review by and with the approval of the compensation committee all members of the compensation committee are independent directors as defined in the applicable rules for issuers traded on the nasdaq stock market 

  

for additional information regarding stock option plan activity for the past three years see the reconciliation of options outstanding in “note 12 employee stock benefit plans” in notes to consolidated financial statements information regarding our stock option plans should be read in conjunction with the information appearing under the heading “report of the compensation committee on executive compensation” in our 2004 proxy statement which is incorporated by reference

business outlook 

  

as we look ahead to the rest of 2004 we are planning for growth in annual revenue and further progress in gross profit margin we expect continued growth in the total number of computers using the intel pentium 4 processor as well as increasing acceptance of our pentium m processor the processor integral to intel centrino mobile technology demand for our flash memory products is uncertain in the highly competitive cellular handset market segment revenue growth for our flash memory products is largely dependent on customer demand for higher density flash memory and continued end user adoption of new leadingedge cellular handsets the outlook for the telecommunications industry continues to be soft in this environment revenue growth for our networking and communications business is largely dependent on our securing design wins for new products and oems taking these product designs to production 

  

our financial results are substantially dependent on sales of microprocessors and related components by the intel architecture operating segment revenue is partly a function of the mix of microprocessor types and speeds sold as well as the mix of related chipsets and motherboards all of which are difficult to forecast because of the wide price differences among performance desktop value desktop mobile and server microprocessors the mix of types of microprocessors sold affects the average price that we will realize and has a large impact on our revenue and gross margin microprocessor revenue is also dependent on the availability of other parts of the system platform including chipsets motherboards operating system software and application software revenue is also affected by our sales of other semiconductor and nonsemiconductor products and is subject to the impact of economic conditions in various geographic regions 

  

our gross margin expectation for 2004 is 62 plus or minus a few points the 62 midpoint is five points higher than the 2003 gross margin of 57 the gross margin expectation reflects the substantial yeartoyear growth that we have seen in the intel architecture business and the impact of spreading our fixed costs over a greater number of units gross margin should also benefit from the productive use of 90nanometer technology and 300mm wafers as we build more of our mainstream products with these technologies our gross margin varies primarily with revenue levels which are dependent on unit volumes and prices as well as the mix of types and speeds of processors sold and the mix of microprocessors related chipsets and motherboards and other semiconductor and nonsemiconductor products variability of other factors will also continue to affect cost of sales and the gross margin percentage including unit costs and yield issues associated with production at our factories timing and execution of the manufacturing ramp including the ramp of the 90nanometer process technology on 300mm wafers excess manufacturing capacity the reusability of factory equipment impairment of manufacturing or assembly and test assets excess inventory inventory obsolescence and variations in inventory valuation 

  

we have significantly expanded our semiconductor manufacturing and assembly and test capacity over the last few years and we continue to plan capacity based on the assumed continued success of our overall strategy and the acceptance of our products in specific market segments we currently expect that capital spending will be between 36 billion and 40 billion in 2004 compared to 37 billion in 2003 the midpoint of this range 38 billion is only slightly higher than in 2003 most of the capital spending for 2004 will go to building or equipping our 300mm wafer facilities the efficiencies of 300mm wafers translate into more capacity for less invested capital in terms of end use about 85 of the budget is directed to manufacturing capability the same portion as in 2003 we expect more than half of the capital spending to go toward fabrication fab manufacturing equipment and more than a quarter to land and construction the remaining portion is expected to be spent on other machinery and equipment in terms of technology the emphasis in capital spending is shifting to smaller geometries over 60 of the 2004 budget for fab manufacturing equipment is expected to be invested in manufacturing processes of 65 nanometer and smaller this capital spending plan is dependent on expectations regarding production efficiencies and delivery times of various machinery and equipment and construction schedules for new facilities if the demand for our products does not grow and continue to move toward higher performance products in the various market segments revenue and gross margin would be adversely affected manufacturing andor assembly and test capacity would be underutilized and the rate of capital spending could be further reduced we could be required to record an impairment of our manufacturing or assembly and test equipment andor facilities or factory planning decisions may cause us to record accelerated depreciation however in the long term revenue and gross margin may also be adversely affected if we do not add capacity fast enough to meet increased market demand 

  

depreciation for 2004 is expected to be approximately 46 billion compared to 47 billion in 2003 

  

our industry is characterized by very short product life cycles and our continued success is dependent on technological advancement including developing and implementing new processes and strategic products for specific market segments because we consider it imperative to maintain a strong research and development program spending for research and development in 2004 is 

  

index to financial statements management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

continued 

  

expected to increase to approximately 48 billion from 44 billion in 2003 the expected increase is primarily driven by development of our nextgeneration 65nanometer process technology as well as designing future microprocessors and communications initiatives we also intend to continue spending to promote our products and to increase the value of our product brands 

  

based on acquisitions completed through february 18 2004 we expect amortization of acquisitionrelated intangibles and costs to be approximately 170 million in 2004 

  

we currently expect our tax rate to be approximately 32 for 2004 the estimated effective tax rate is based on current tax law and the current expected income and assumes that the company continues to receive the tax benefit for export sales see “note 21 contingencies” in notes to consolidated financial statements the tax rate may be affected by the closing of acquisitions or divestitures the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed and the ability to realize deferred tax assets 

  

as of december 27 2003 we have approximately 37 billion of goodwill remaining on our balance sheet substantially all of which is related to the icg operating segment if we fail to deliver new products for icg if the products fail to gain expected market acceptance or if market conditions in the communications business fail to improve our revenue and cost forecasts may not be achieved and we may incur additional charges for impairment of goodwill 

  

at the end of 2003 we held nonmarketable equity securities with a carrying value of 665 million if the level of ipo market activity does not increase and the availability of venture capital funding for technology investments does not improve our nonmarketable investments may be adversely affected as companies within our portfolio attempt to raise additional funds the funds may not be available to them or they may receive lower valuations with less favorable investment terms than in previous financings and our investments would likely become impaired however we are not able to determine at the present time which specific investments are likely to be impaired in the future or the extent or timing of individual impairments 

  

we are currently a party to various legal proceedings and claims including claims related to taxes management does not believe that the ultimate outcome of these legal proceedings and claims will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or overall trends in results of operations however litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur an unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages additional taxes owed or in cases where injunctive relief is sought an injunction prohibiting intel from selling one or more products if an unfavorable ruling were to occur in any specific period there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the results of operations of that period or future periods management believes that given our current liquidity and cash and investment balances even an adverse judgment would not have a material impact on cash and investments or liquidity 

  

we operate globally with sales offices and research and development activities as well as manufacturing and assembly and test facilities in many countries and as a result we are subject to risks and factors associated with doing business outside the us global operations involve inherent risks that include currency controls and fluctuations tariff and import regulations and regulatory requirements that may limit our or our customers’ ability to manufacture assemble and test design develop or sell products in particular countries if terrorist activity armed conflict civil or military unrest or political instability occurs in the us israel or other locations such events may disrupt manufacturing assembly and test logistics security and communications and could also result in reduced demand for intel’s products the impacts of major health concerns or of largescale outages or interruptions of service from utility or other infrastructure providers on intel its suppliers customers or other third parties could also adversely affect our business and impact customer order patterns we could also be affected if labor issues disrupt our transportation arrangements or those of our customers or suppliers on a worldwide basis we regularly review our key infrastructure systems services and suppliers both internally and externally to seek to identify significant vulnerabilities as well as areas of potential business impact if a disruptive event were to occur once we identify a significant vulnerability we assess the risks and as we consider it to be appropriate we initiate actions intended to reduce the risks and their potential impact however there can be no assurance that we have identified all significant risks or that we can mitigate all identified risks with reasonable effort 

  

our future results of operations and the other forwardlooking statements contained in this filing including this mda involve a number of risks and uncertainties—in particular the statements regarding our goals and strategies new product introductions plans to cultivate new businesses market segment share and growth rate assumptions future economic conditions and recovery in the communications businesses revenue pricing gross margin and costs capital spending depreciation and amortization research and development expenses potential impairment of investments the tax rate and pending tax and legal proceedings in addition to various factors that we have discussed above a number of other factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations

demand for our products which impacts our revenue and gross margin percentage is affected by business and economic conditions as well as computing and communications industry trends and the development and timing of introduction of compelling software applications and operating systems that take advantage of the features of our products demand for our products is also affected by changes in customer order patterns such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by our customers and the timing of customer purchases revenue and gross margin could also be affected by competitive factors such as competing chip architectures and manufacturing technologies competing softwarecompatible microprocessors pricing pressures and other competitive factors as well as market acceptance of our new products in specific market segments the availability of sufficient inventory to meet demand and the availability of externally purchased components our future revenue is also dependent on continuing technological advancement including developing and implementing new processes and strategic products as well as the timing of new product introductions sustaining and growing new businesses and integrating and operating any acquired businesses our results could also be affected by adverse effects associated with product defects and errata deviations from published specifications and by litigation involving intellectual property stockholder consumer and other issues 

  

we believe that we have the product offerings facilities personnel and competitive and financial resources for continued business success but future revenue costs gross margins and profits are all influenced by a number of factors including those discussed above all of which are inherently difficult to forecast 

  

status of business outlook and related risk factor statements 

  

we expect that our corporate representatives will from time to time meet privately with investors investment analysts the media and others and may reiterate the forwardlooking statements contained in the “business outlook” section and elsewhere in this form 10k including any such statements that are incorporated by reference in this form 10k at the same time we will keep this form 10k and our then current business outlook publicly available on our investor relations web site wwwintccom the public can continue to rely on the business outlook published on the web site as representing our current expectations on matters covered unless we publish a notice stating otherwise the statements in business outlook and other forwardlooking statements in this form 10k are subject to revision during the course of the year in our quarterly earnings releases and sec filings our midquarter business updates and at other times 

  

we intend to publish a midquarter business update on march 4 2004 from the close of business on february 27 2004 until publication of the update we will observe a “quiet period” during which the business outlook and other forwardlooking statements first published in our earnings press release on january 14 2004 as reiterated or updated as applicable in this form 10k should be considered historical speaking as of prior to the quiet period only and not subject to update during the quiet period our representatives will not comment on the business outlook or our financial results or expectations 

  

a quiet period operating in similar fashion with regard to the business outlook and our form 10k will begin at the close of business on march 12 2004 and will extend until the day that our next quarterly earnings release is published presently scheduled for april 13 2004

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend   

we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in currency exchange rates interest rates and marketable equity security prices to mitigate these risks we may utilize derivative financial instruments among other strategies we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes all of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial positions at december 27 2003 actual results may differ materially 

  

currency exchange rates we generally hedge currency risks of nonus dollardenominated investments in debt securities with offsetting currency borrowings currency forward contracts or currency interest rate swaps gains and losses on these nonuscurrency investments would generally be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments resulting in negligible net exposure 

  

a substantial majority of our revenue expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars however we do enter into transactions in other currencies primarily the euro and certain other european and asian currencies to protect against reductions in value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates we have established balance sheet and forecasted transaction hedging programs currency forward contracts are utilized in these hedging programs our hedging programs reduce but do not always entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements we considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates of 20 for all currencies could be experienced in the near term such adverse changes after taking into account hedges and offsetting positions would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before taxes of less than 10 million as of the end of each of 2003 and 2002 

  

interest rates the primary objective of our investments in debt securities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk to achieve this objective the returns on a substantial majority of our marketable investments in longterm fixed rate debt securities are swapped to us dollar liborbased returns we considered the historical volatility of the threemonth libor rate experienced in prior years and determined that it was reasonably possible that an adverse change of 80 basis points approximately 68 of the rate at the end of 2003 could be experienced in the near term a hypothetical 080 80basispoint increase in interest rates after taking into account hedges and offsetting positions would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our investment securities of approximately 10 million or less as of the end of each of 2003 and 2002 

  

marketable equity security prices we have a portfolio of equity investments that includes marketable strategic equity securities trading assets and derivative equity instruments such as warrants and options as well as nonmarketable equity investments we invest in companies that develop software hardware and other technologies or provide services supporting technologies this strategic investment program helps advance our overall mission to be the preeminent supplier of building blocks to the worldwide internet economy our current investment focus areas include enabling mobile and internet client devices helping to create the digital home advancing highperformance communications infrastructure and developing the next generation of silicon production technologies our focus areas tend to develop and change over time due to rapid advancements in the technology field 

  

to the extent that our marketable portfolio of investments continues to have strategic value we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposure for those securities that we no longer consider strategic we evaluate market and economic factors in our decision on the timing of disposal and whether it is possible and appropriate to hedge the equity market risk as of december 27 2003 the fair value of our portfolio of marketable equity investments and equity derivative instruments including hedging positions was 591 million 

  

to assess the market price sensitivity of our marketable portfolio we analyzed the historical movements over the past several years of hightechnology stock indices that we considered appropriate based on the analysis of these indices we estimated that it was reasonably possible that the prices of the stocks in our portfolio could experience a 30 adverse change in the near term however our marketable portfolio is substantially concentrated in one company which will affect the marketable portfolio’s price volatility we currently have an investment in micron technology inc of approximately 458 million or 77 of the total marketable value including equity derivative instruments the investment in micron is part of our strategy to support the development and supply of dynamic random access memory dram products we analyzed the historical volatility of micron’s stock and if the stock behaves with the same price volatility that it has in the past we could experience a 60 loss if we apply a 60 hypothetical change to the entire portfolio the hypothetical loss would be significantly larger than the loss assuming a 30 decline 

  

index to financial statements the table below presents the fair value and hypothetical loss for our marketable portfolio given the specified percentage decreases in equity prices the estimated decreases reflect the impact of hedges and offsetting positions and are not necessarily indicative of future performance actual results may differ materially 

  

   

   

   

nonmarketable equity securities our strategic investments in nonmarketable equity securities would also be affected by an adverse movement of equity market prices although the impact cannot be directly quantified such a movement and the related underlying economic conditions would negatively affect the prospects of the companies we invest in their ability to raise additional capital and the likelihood of our being able to realize our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings mergers and private sales these types of investments involve a great deal of risk and there can be no assurance that any specific company will grow or will become successful consequently we could lose all or part of our investment at december 27 2003 our strategic investments in nonmarketable equity securities had a carrying amount of 665 million excluding equity derivatives that were subject to marktomarket requirements

 item 9a controls and procedures tableend   

controls evaluation and related ceo and cfo certifications 

  

we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our “disclosure controls and procedures” disclosure controls as of the end of the period covered by this annual report the controls evaluation was done under the supervision and with the participation of management including our chief executive officer ceo and chief financial officer cfo 

  

attached as exhibits to this annual report are certifications of the ceo and the cfo which are required in accordance with rule 13a14 of the exchange act this “controls and procedures” section includes the information concerning the controls evaluation referred to in the certifications and it should be read in conjunction with the certifications for a more complete understanding of the topics presented 

  

definition of disclosure controls 

  

disclosure controls are controls and procedures designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the exchange act such as this annual report is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission’s rules and forms disclosure controls are also designed to reasonably assure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including the ceo and cfo as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure our disclosure controls include components of our internal control over financial reporting which consists of control processes designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us to the extent that components of our internal control over financial reporting are included within our disclosure controls they are included in the scope of our quarterly controls evaluation 

  

limitations on the effectiveness of controls 

  

the company’s management including the ceo and cfo does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 

  

scope of the controls evaluation 

  

the evaluation of our disclosure controls included a review of the controls’ objectives and design the company’s implementation of the controls and the effect of the controls on the information generated for use in this annual report in the course of the controls evaluation we sought to identify data errors control problems or acts of fraud and confirm that appropriate corrective action including process improvements were being undertaken this type of evaluation is performed on a quarterly basis so that the conclusions of management including the ceo and cfo concerning the effectiveness of the controls can be reported in our quarterly reports on form 10q and to supplement our disclosures made in our annual report on form 10k many of the components of our disclosure controls are also evaluated on an ongoing basis by our internal audit department and by other personnel in our finance organization as well as our independent auditors who evaluate them in connection with determining their auditing procedures related 

  

index to financial statements to their report on our annual financial statements and not to provide assurance on our controls the overall goals of these various evaluation activities are to monitor our disclosure controls and to modify them as necessary our intent is to maintain the disclosure controls as dynamic systems that change as conditions warrant 

  

among other matters we also considered whether our evaluation identified any “significant deficiencies” or “material weaknesses” in our internal control over financial reporting and whether the company had identified any acts of fraud involving personnel with a significant role in our internal control over financial reporting this information was important both for the controls evaluation generally and because item 5 in the certifications of the ceo and cfo requires that the ceo and cfo disclose that information to our board’s audit committee and to our independent auditors in the professional auditing literature “significant deficiencies” are referred to as “reportable conditions” which are deficiencies in the design or operation of controls that could adversely affect our ability to record process summarize and report financial data in the financial statements auditing literature defines “material weakness” as a particularly serious reportable condition in which the internal control does not reduce to a relatively low level the risk that misstatements caused by error or fraud may occur in amounts that would be material in relation to the financial statements and the risk that such misstatements would not be detected within a timely period by employees in the normal course of performing their assigned functions we also sought to address other controls matters in the controls evaluation and in each case if a problem was identified we considered what revision improvement andor correction to make in accordance with our ongoing procedures 

  

conclusions 

  

based upon the controls evaluation our ceo and cfo have concluded that subject to the limitations noted above as of the end of the period covered by this annual report our disclosure controls were effective to provide reasonable assurance that material information relating to intel and its consolidated subsidiaries is made known to management including the ceo and cfo particularly during the period when our periodic reports are being prepared

manufacturing assembly and test 

the majority of our wafer production including microprocessor flash memory and networking silicon fabrication is conducted within the united states at our facilities in new mexico oregon arizona california and massachusetts a significant portion of our wafer production primarily microprocessor and chipset fabrication is conducted outside the united states at facilities in israel and ireland for the fourth quarter of 2000 the israel and ireland facilities accounted for approximately 30 of our total wafer fabrication 

as of yearend 2000 substantially all of our microprocessors were built using the 018micron process technology we are manufacturing wafers using the 018micron process technology in arizona california ireland israel new mexico and oregon in november 2000 we announced the completion of the development of the 013micron 130 nanometer process technology the 013micron process technology features structures that are smaller than 11000th the thickness of a human hair 018 microns is 1500th the thickness of a human hair we expect to begin manufacturing our first product using 013micron process technology in production volumes in the second half of 2001 enabling us to continue to deliver new generations of highperformance microprocessors we believe that we were the first company to complete development of the 013micron process technology and to demonstrate manufacturing readiness with complex integrated circuits 

in 2000 we announced that we would begin building highvolume 300mm 12inch wafer fabrication facilities some of these facilities will begin production on 013micron process technology the largest wafer size we currently use in wafer production is 200mm 8inch wafer we expect the larger 300mm wafer size to cut die manufacturing costs by more than 30 we plan to start production using 300mm wafers in 2002 

during the first quarter of 2000 we purchased a fabrication facility in colorado during 2000 we made substantial retrofitting changes and process improvements at this facility including equipment installations to manufacture flash memory we expect to begin manufacturing at the colorado facility in the second quarter of 2001 

we also manufacture microprocessor and networkingrelated boardlevel products and systems at facilities in malaysia oregon and washington in addition we manufacture boardlevel products in puerto rico however in january 2001 we announced that we would phase out our manufacturing operations in puerto rico during the first half of 2001 based on an assessment across our worldwide boardlevel manufacturing facilities we concluded that the operations in puerto rico were less cost competitive than our other operations 

a substantial majority of our components assembly and testing including assembly and testing for microprocessors is performed at facilities in costa rica malaysia and the philippines we also perform components assembly and testing at a facility in china and in august 2000 announced plans to expand this facility 

to augment capacity in the united states as well as internationally we use subcontractors to perform assembly of certain products and wafer fabrication for certain components primarily flash memory chipsets and networking and communications component products we also use subcontractors for the manufacture of some boardlevel products and systems and purchase certain communication networking products and pc peripherals from external vendors 

in general if we were unable to manufacture wafers or to assemble and test our products abroad or if air transportation between our foreign facilities and the united states were disrupted there could be a material adverse effect upon our operations in addition to normal manufacturing assembly and test risks our operations outside the united states are subject to certain additional exposures including currency controls and fluctuations tariff import and other restrictions and regulations and 

political instability such as unrest in israel to date we have not experienced significant difficulties related to these foreign business risks 

manufacturing of integrated circuits is a complex process normal manufacturing risks include errors and interruptions in the production process and defects in raw materials as well as other risks all of which can affect yields a substantial decrease in yields would result in higher manufacturing costs and the possibility of not being able to produce sufficient volume to meet specific product demand 

employees 

as of december 30 2000 we employed approximately 86100 people worldwide 

sales 

most of our products are sold or licensed through sales offices located near major concentrations of users throughout north america europe asiapacific japan and other parts of the world 

we also use industrial and retail distributors and representatives to distribute our products both within and outside the united states typically distributors handle a wide variety of products including those that compete with our products and fill orders for many customers most of our sales to distributors are made under agreements allowing for price protection on unsold merchandise and right of return on stipulated quantities of unsold merchandise sales representatives generally do not offer directly competitive products but may carry complementary items manufactured by others representatives do not maintain a product inventory instead their customers place orders directly with us or through distributors we conducted business with more than 2500 customers worldwide in 2000 including customers of our acquired companies compaq computer corporation and dell computer corporation each contributed approximately 13 to our total sales in 2000 a substantial majority of the sales to these two customers consisted of intel architecture group products no other customer accounted for more than 10 of our total revenues sales to our five largest customers accounted for approximately 42 of total revenues the information regarding revenues and operating profit by reportable segments and revenues from unaffiliated customers by geographic region under the heading operating segment and geographic information on page 33 of our 2000 annual report to stockholders is incorporated by reference 

backlog 

our sales are made primarily pursuant to standard purchase orders for delivery of standard products we have some agreements that give a customer the right to purchase a specific number of products during a specified time period although not generally obligating the customer to purchase any particular number of such products some of these agreements do contain billback clauses under these clauses customers who do not purchase the full volume agreed to are liable for billback on previous shipments up to the price appropriate for the quantity actually purchased as a matter of industry practice billback clauses are difficult to enforce the quantity actually purchased by the customer as well as the shipment schedules are frequently revised during the agreement term to reflect changes in the customers needs in light of industry practice and experience we do not believe that such agreements are meaningful for determining backlog amounts we believe that only a small portion of our order backlog is noncancellable and that the dollar amount associated with the noncancellable portion is not material therefore we do not believe that backlog as of any particular date is indicative of future results 

competition 

our goal is to be the preeminent building block supplier to the worldwide internet economy our primary focus areas are the desktop and mobile platforms the server platform and networking and communications including wireless communications as well as new business opportunities around the internet in each of these market segments we compete to various degrees on the basis of functionality performance quality price and availability we are engaged in a rapidly advancing field of technology in which our ability to compete depends upon our ability to improve our products and processes develop new products to meet changing customer requirements and reduce costs prices decline rapidly in the semiconductor industry as unit volumes grow further competition develops and production experience is accumulated many companies compete with us in the various computing networking and communications market segments and are engaged in the same basic fields of activity including research and development both within and outside the united states these competitors range in size from large multinational companies to smaller companies competing in specialized market segments 

the intel architecture group operating segment supports the desktop mobile and server platform initiatives our strategy for the desktop mobile and server platforms is to introduce everhigher performance microprocessors and chipsets developed for different market segments of the worldwide computing market using a tiered branding approach to further enhance the acceptance and deployment of these products by our customers we also provide ebusiness enabling solutions in line with our strategy we seek to develop higher performance microprocessors based on the p6 microarchitecture specifically for each computing segment we also plan to introduce higher performance versions of processors based on the intel netburst microarchitecture 

our financial results are substantially dependent on sales of microprocessors by the intel architecture group a number of competitors market softwarecompatible products intended to compete with intel architecturebased processors we also face significant competition from companies offering rival microprocessor architectures the celeron processor competes with existing and future products in the highly competitive value pc market segment the pentium iii processor and the pentium 4 processor compete with existing and future products in the performance desktop and entrylevel workstation market segment competitive product offerings in the performance desktop market segment have recently increased the pentium iii xeon processor competes in the midrange and highend server and workstation market segments with established products based on rival architectures 

many of our competitors are licensed to use our patents furthermore based on current case law our competitors can design microprocessors that are compatible with our microprocessors and avoid our patent rights through the use of foundry services that have licenses with us competitors products may add features increase performance or sell at lower prices we cannot predict whether our products will continue to compete successfully with such existing rival architectures or whether new architectures will establish or gain market acceptance or provide increased competition with our products future distortion of price maturity curves could occur if softwarecompatible products enter the market segment in significant volume or alternative architectures gain market acceptance 

we plan to cultivate new businesses as well as continue to work with the computing industry to expand internet capabilities and product offerings and develop compelling software applications that can take advantage of higher performance microprocessors and chipsets increasing demand for intels newer products in each computing market segment we may continue to take various steps including reducing microprocessor prices and offering rebates at such times as we deem appropriate in order to increase acceptance of our latest technology and to remain competitive within each relevant market segment 

in the networking and communications infrastructure area our strategy is to deliver both systemlevel communications building blocks at various levels of integration and componentlevel silicon building blocks for networking and communications systems we have made acquisitions and expect to make additional acquisitions to grow the networking and communications areas the network communications silicon and network connectivity products from the network communications group face competition from both established and emerging companies the competitors in these areas use aggressive product and acquisition plans in efforts to achieve leadingedge market positions the communications products group operating segment supports initiatives to deliver the systemlevel communications products directed at service providers running ebusiness data centers the communications products group focuses on selling its intel netstructure products to oem customers the communications products group also provides componentlevel products for converged voice and data communications systems for the telecommunications industry these products compete in the small and midsized enterprise market segments with established products and leadingedge internet communications systems and server products we cannot predict whether our networking and communications products will continue to compete successfully with products from existing competitors or products from new entrants to these market segments 

in the cellular wireless communications business our strategy is to deliver featurerich enhanced flash memory products and highspeed processors for handheld wireless devices that require high performance and low power in supplying these products our wireless communications and computing group faces competition from established companies in the flash memory applications processor and baseband chipset market segments 

research and development 

our competitive position has developed to a large extent because of our emphasis on research and development this emphasis has enabled us to deliver leadingedge technology and has permitted our customers to commit to the use of these new products in the development of their own products our research and development activities are directed toward developing new products hardware technologies and manufacturing processes as well as improving existing products and lowering costs 

a substantial majority of the design and development of components and other products is performed in the united states at our facilities in california oregon arizona and washington outside the united states we have product development facilities at various locations including israel denmark and malaysia we also maintain research and development facilities dedicated to improving manufacturing processes in arizona california and oregon 

in 2000 we shipped thousands of prototype processors based on the ia64 architecture for highend servers under the itanium brand and began to ship processors for systems used by information technology end users in pilot installations we expect the release of production systems during 2001 the itanium processor is built on the 018micron process technology during 2000 approximately half of our microprocessor research and development budget was spent on initiatives related to the server and workstation market segment 

in addition to microprocessor and chipset research and development we have research and development initiatives in wireless devices networking and communications products connected peripherals and other areas these research and development initiatives include projects surrounding the intel xscale microarchitecture for wireless devices and the intel ixa architecture for networking and communications products we have also acquired ongoing research and development activities in these areas with businesses acquired in 2000 

our expenditures for research and development were 3897 million in fiscal year 2000 3111 million in fiscal year 1999 and 2509 million in fiscal year 1998 these amounts exclude charges for purchased inprocess research and development related to acquisitions of 109 million for fiscal year 2000 392 million for fiscal year 1999 and 165 million for fiscal year 1998 at december 2000 we had approximately 20500 employees engaged in research and development the success of our research and development activities is dependent upon competitive circumstances as well as our ability to bring new products to market in each computing market segment and in our other businesses in a timely and costeffective manner 

acquisitions and strategic investments 

during 2000 we acquired 16 businesses for more than 27 billion augmenting our capabilities in a number of strategic areas the companies acquired included ambient giga picazo basis trillium and ziatech these acquisitions are discussed under the products heading in part i item 1 of this form 10k in connection with each related business group 

under our intel capital program we also make equity investments to further our strategic objectives and to support our key business initiatives in the areas of desktop and mobile platforms server platforms networking and communications and internet services we want to stimulate growth in computing communications and the internet and to grow the total information infrastructure in order to create and expand markets for our products this strategic investment program helps advance our overall mission of being a leading provider of key building blocks to the internet economy while financial returns are not our primary goal our strategic investment program seeks to invest in companies that can succeed and have an impact on their market segment when the strategic objectives of an investment have been achieved or if the investment diverges from our strategic objectives we may decide to dispose of the investment as of yearend 2000 our strategic equity portfolio was valued 

at approximately 37 billion including marketable investments at their market value and nonmarketable investments at cost 

intellectual property and licensing 

intellectual property rights that apply to our various products include patents copyrights trade secrets trademarks and maskwork rights intel has established an active program to protect its investment in technology by enforcing its intellectual property rights we do not intend to license our intellectual property rights broadly unless we can obtain adequate consideration we also refer to information appearing under the heading competition in part i item 1 of this form 10k 

we have filed and obtained a number of patents in the united states and abroad and we have entered into patent crosslicense agreements with many of our major competitors and other parties while our intellectual property rights are important to our success our business as a whole is not materially dependent upon any particular patent or license we and other companies in the computer telecommunications and related hightechnology fields typically apply for and receive in the aggregate thousands of patents annually in the united states and other countries in addition because of the fast pace of innovation and product development our products are often obsolete before the patents related to them expire as a result we believe that the duration of the applicable patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products 

we protect many of our computer programs by copyrighting them we have registered numerous copyrights with the united states copyright office the ability to protect or copyright software in some foreign jurisdictions is not clear however it is our policy to require customers to obtain a software license contract before we provide them with certain computer programs certain components contain embedded computer programs and we have also obtained copyright protection for some of these programs in addition we have obtained protection for the maskworks for a number of our components under the chip protection act of 1984 

we have obtained certain trademarks and trade names for our products to distinguish genuine intel products from our competitors products and we are currently engaged in a cooperative program with oems to identify with the intel inside® logo certain personal computers containing genuine intel microprocessors we maintain certain details about our processes products and strategies as trade secrets 

like many companies in the semiconductor and other hightechnology industries we have from time to time been notified of claims that we may be infringing certain intellectual property rights of others these claims have been referred to counsel and they are in various stages of evaluation and negotiation if it appears necessary or desirable we may seek licenses for these intellectual property rights we can give no assurance that licenses will be offered by all claimants that the terms of any offered licenses will be acceptable to us or that in all cases the dispute will be resolved without litigation which may be time consuming and expensive and may result in injunctive relief or the payment of damages by us we also refer to the information appearing under the heading legal proceedings in part i item 3 of this form 10k
