 item 1 business 

general 

nvr inc a virginia corporation was formed in 1980 as nvhomes inc our primary business is the construction and sale of singlefamily detached homes townhomes and condominium buildings all of which are primarily constructed on a presold basis to more fully serve customers of our homebuilding operations we also operate a mortgage banking and title services business we conduct our homebuilding activities directly our mortgage banking operations are operated primarily through a wholly owned subsidiary nvr mortgage finance inc “nvrm” unless the context otherwise requires references to “nvr” “we” “us” or “our” include nvr inc and its consolidated subsidiaries 

we are one of the largest homebuilders in the united states we operate in thirtyfour metropolitan areas in fourteen states and washington dc our homebuilding operations include the construction and sale of singlefamily detached homes townhomes and condominium buildings under three trade names ryan homes nvhomes and heartland homes our ryan homes product is marketed primarily to firsttime and firsttime moveup buyers ryan homes operates in thirtyfour metropolitan areas located in maryland virginia washington dc west virginia pennsylvania new york north carolina south carolina florida ohio new jersey delaware indiana illinois and tennessee our nvhomes and heartland homes products are marketed primarily to moveup and luxury buyers nvhomes operates in delaware and the washington dc baltimore md and philadelphia pa metropolitan areas heartland homes operates in the pittsburgh pa metropolitan area during 2021 approximately 16 of our home settlements accounting for approximately 22 of our homebuilding revenue occurred in the washington dc metropolitan area 

we generally do not engage in land development see discussion below of our land development activities instead we typically acquire finished building lots from various third party land developers pursuant to fixed price finished lot purchase agreements “lpas” that require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the lpas the deposits required under the lpas are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and typically range up to 10 of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots 

we believe that our lot acquisition strategy avoids the financial requirements and risks associated with direct land ownership and land development we may at our option choose for any reason and at any time not to perform under these lpas by delivering notice of our intent not to acquire the finished lots under contract our sole legal obligation and economic loss for failure to perform under these lpas is limited to the amount of the deposit pursuant to the liquidated damage provision contained within the lpas we do not have any financial guarantees or completion obligations and we typically do not guarantee lot purchases on a specific performance basis under these lpas none of the creditors of any of the development entities with which we have entered these lpas have recourse to our general credit we generally seek to maintain control over a supply of lots believed to be suitable to meet our fiveyear business plan 

in addition to constructing homes primarily on a presold basis and utilizing what we believe is a conservative lot acquisition strategy we focus on obtaining and maintaining a leading market position in each market we serve this strategy allows us to gain valuable efficiencies and competitive advantages in our markets which we believe contributes to minimizing the adverse effects of regional economic cycles and provides growth opportunities within these markets our continued success is contingent upon our ability to control an adequate supply of finished lots on which to build as a result in certain specific strategic circumstances we deviate from our historical lot acquisition strategy and engage in joint venture arrangements with land developers or directly acquire raw ground already zoned for its intended use for development once we acquire control of raw ground we determine whether to sell the raw parcel to a developer and enter into an lpa with the developer to purchase the finished lots or hire a developer to develop the land on our behalf while joint venture arrangements and direct land development activity are not our preferred method of acquiring finished building lots we may enter into additional transactions in the future on a limited basis where there exists a compelling strategic or prudent financial reason to do so we expect however to continue to acquire substantially all of our finished lot inventory using lpas with forfeitable deposits see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 of this form 10k for additional discussion of lots controlled in addition see notes 3 4 and 5 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information regarding lpas joint ventures and land under development respectively 

in addition to building and selling homes we provide a number of mortgagerelated services through our mortgage banking operations through operations in each of our homebuilding markets nvrm originates mortgage loans almost exclusively for our homebuyers nvrm generates revenues primarily from origination fees gains on sales of loans and title fees nvrm sells all of the mortgage loans it closes into the secondary markets on a servicing released basis 

segment information for our homebuilding and mortgage banking businesses is included in note 2 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

homebuilding 

products 

we offer singlefamily detached homes townhomes and condominium buildings with many different home designs these home designs have a variety of elevations and numerous other options our homes combine traditional transitional cottage or urban exterior designs with contemporary interior designs and amenities generally include two to four bedrooms and range from approximately 1000 to 10000 finished square feet during 2021 the prices at which we settled homes ranged from approximately 140000 to 2 million and averaged 403900 during 2020 our average price of homes settled was 370800 

markets 

our four reportable homebuilding segments operate in the following geographic regions 



backlog 

backlog which represents homes sold but not yet settled with the customer totaled 12730 units and approximately 58 billion at december 31 2021 compared to 11549 units and approximately 46 billion at december 31 2020 the average price of homes in backlog increased to 454200 at december 31 2021 from 396200 at december 312020 backlog may be impacted by customer cancellations for various reasons that are beyond our control such as the customer’s failure to obtain mortgage financing inability to sell an existing home job loss or a variety of other reasons in any period a portion of the cancellations that we experience are related to new sales that occurred during the same period and a portion are related to sales that occurred in prior periods and therefore appeared in the opening backlog for the current period expressed as the total of all cancellations during the period as a percentage of gross sales during the period our cancellation rate was 92 149 and 146 in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively additionally approximately 3 in 2021 and 6 in both 2020 and 2019 of a reporting quarter’s opening backlog balance cancelled during the quarter we can provide no assurance that our historical cancellation rates are indicative of the actual cancellation rate that may occur in future periods other than those units that are cancelled and subject to potential construction delays resulting from covid19 related restrictions andor continued supply chain disruptions we expect to settle substantially all of our december 31 2021 backlog during 2022 see “risk factors” in item 1a and “seasonality” in item 7 of this form 10k 

further discussion of settlements new orders and backlog activity by our homebuilding reportable segment for each of the last three years can be found in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 of this form 10k 

construction 

we utilize independent subcontractors under fixed price contracts to perform construction work on our homes we use many independent subcontractors in our various markets and we are not dependent on any single subcontractor or on a small number of subcontractors 

sales and marketing 

our preferred marketing method is for customers to visit a furnished model home featuring many builtin options and a landscaped lot the garages of these model homes are usually converted into temporary sales centers where alternative facades and floor plans are displayed and designs for other models are available for review sales representatives are compensated predominantly on a commission basis 

regulation 

we and our subcontractors must comply with various federal state and local zoning building environmental advertising and consumer credit statutes rules and regulations as well as other regulations and requirements in connection with our construction and sales activities all of these regulations have increased the cost to produce and market our products and in some instances have delayed our developers’ ability to deliver finished lots to us counties and cities in which we build homes have at times declared moratoriums on the issuance of building permits and imposed other restrictions in the areas in which sewage treatment facilities and other public facilities do not reach minimum standards in addition our homebuilding operations are regulated in certain areas by restrictive zoning and density requirements that limit the number of homes that can be built within the boundaries of a particular area to date restrictive zoning laws and the imposition of moratoriums have not had a material adverse effect on our construction activities 

competition and market factors 

the housing industry is highly competitive we compete with numerous homebuilders of varying size ranging from local to national in scope some of which have greater financial resources than we do we also face competition from the home resale market our homebuilding operations compete primarily on the basis of price location design quality service and reputation historically we have been one of the market leaders in each of the markets where we build homes 

the housing industry is cyclical and is affected by consumer confidence levels prevailing economic conditions and interest rates other factors that affect the housing industry and the demand for new homes include the availability and the cost of land labor and materials changes in consumer preferences demographic trends and the availability of mortgage finance programs see “risk factors” in item 1a of this form 10k for additional information regarding these risks 

we are dependent upon building material suppliers for a continuous flow of raw materials whenever possible we utilize standard products available from multiple sources in the past such raw materials have been generally available to us in adequate supply however during 2021 increased construction activity and demand for building materials coupled with the ongoing effects of the covid19 pandemic has led to supply chain disruptions and longer construction cycle times 

mortgage banking 

we provide a number of mortgage related services to our homebuilding customers through our mortgage banking operations our mortgage banking operations also include separate subsidiaries that broker title insurance and perform title searches in connection with mortgage loan closings for which they receive commissions and fees because nvrm originates mortgage loans almost exclusively for our homebuilding customers nvrm is dependent on our homebuilding segment in 2021 nvrm closed approximately 17700 loans with an aggregate principal amount of approximately 61 billion as compared to approximately 16700 loans with an aggregate principal amount of approximately 53 billion in 2020 

nvrm sells all of the mortgage loans it closes to investors in the secondary markets on a servicing released basis typically within 30 days from the loan closing nvrm is an approved sellerservicer for fannie mae “fnma” and freddie mac fhlmc mortgage loans and an approved sellerissuer of ginnie mae “gnma” department of veterans affairs “va” and federal housing administration “fha” mortgage loans 

regulation 

nvrm is subject to the rules and regulations of fnma gnma fhlmc va and fha these rules and regulations restrict certain activities of nvrm nvrm is currently eligible and expects to remain eligible to participate in such programs in addition nvrm is subject to regulation at the state and federal level including regulations issued by the consumer financial protection bureau the “cfpb” with respect to specific origination selling and servicing practices 

competition and market factors 

nvrm’s main competition comes from national regional and local mortgage bankers mortgage brokers credit unions and banks in each of these markets nvrm competes primarily on the basis of customer service variety of products offered interest rates offered prices of ancillary services and relative financing availability and costs 

pipeline 

nvrm’s mortgage loans in process that had not closed had an aggregate principal balance of approximately 39 billion as of december 31 2021 compared to approximately 34 billion as of december 31 2020 nvrm’s cancellation rate was approximately 41 40 and 36 in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively we can provide no assurance that our historical loan cancellation rates are indicative of the actual loan cancellation rate that may occur in future periods see “risk factors” in item 1a in this form 10k for additional information about factors that could increase our cancellation rate 

human capital 

as of december 31 2021 we had approximately 6600 full time employees of whom approximately 5600 worked in our homebuilding operations and approximately 1000 worked in our mortgage banking operations compared to december 31 2020 when we had approximately 6100 full time employees of whom approximately 5100 worked in our homebuilding operations and approximately 1000 worked in our mortgage banking operations none of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements 

our employees are our most important asset we are committed to hiring and developing an inclusive workplace with a strong diversity of backgrounds and perspectives all of our employees must adhere to our code of ethics and standards of business conduct that sets standards for appropriate behavior in the workplace our compensation philosophy has been consistent for over 20 years and is designed to motivate and retain highly qualified and experienced employees 

we provide tools for the advancement of our employees by offering training and development opportunities that align with each employee’s responsibilities and career path we strive to promote employees from within our workforce as we believe this provides 

both longterm success and continuity to our operations and growth for our employees our focus is demonstrated by the tenure of our executives and our regional and division leaders 

during the past year we hired additional employees to meet the strong housing demand and generally increased our employees’ compensation and benefits packages to protect our employees and homebuyers during the covid19 pandemic we implemented safety protocols such as social distancing on job sites doing virtual house tours working remotely and other health and safety standards as required by federal state and local government agencies we believe our employees adapted and have successfully managed the business during the pandemic

 item 1a risk factors 

our business is affected by the risks generally incident to the residential construction business including but not limited to 

• actual and expected direction of interest rates which affect the availability of mortgage financing for potential purchasers of homes 

• the availability of adequate land in desirable locations on favorable terms 

• employment levels consumer confidence and spending and unexpected changes in customer preferences and 

• changes in the national economy and in the local economies of the markets in which we operate 

all of these risks are discussed in detail below 

business and industry risks 

an economic downturn or decline in economic conditions could adversely affect our business and our results of operations 

demand for new homes is sensitive to economic changes driven by conditions such as employment levels job growth consumer confidence inflation and interest rates if the housing industry suffers a downturn our sales may decline which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

interest rate movements inflation and other economic factors can negatively impact our business 

high rates of inflation generally affect the homebuilding industry adversely because of their adverse impact on interest rates high interest rates not only increase the cost of borrowed funds to homebuilders but also have a significant adverse effect on housing demand and on the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective purchasers we are also subject to potential volatility in the price of commodities that impact costs of materials used in our homebuilding business increases in prevailing interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

our financial results also are affected by the risks generally incident to our mortgage banking business including interest rate levels the impact of government regulation on mortgage loan originations and servicing and the need to issue forward commitments to fund and sell mortgage loans our homebuilding customers account for almost all of our mortgage banking business the volume of our continuing homebuilding operations therefore affects our mortgage banking business 

our mortgage banking business also is affected by interest rate fluctuations we also may experience marketing losses resulting from daily increases in interest rates to the extent we are unable to match interest rates and amounts on loans we have committed to originate with forward commitments from third parties to purchase such loans increases in interest rates may have a material adverse effect on our mortgage banking revenue profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

our operations may also be adversely affected by other economic factors within our markets such as negative changes in employment levels job growth wage growth consumer confidence and household formation and availability of mortgage financing one or all of which could result in reduced demand or price depression from current levels such negative trends could have a material adverse effect on homebuilding operations 

these factors and thus the homebuilding and mortgage banking businesses have at times in the past been cyclical in nature any downturn in the national economy or the local economies of the markets in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations in particular during 2021 approximately 16 of our home settlements which accounted for 22 of our homebuilding revenues occurred in the washington dc metropolitan area thus we are dependent to a significant extent on the economy and demand for housing in that market 

because almost all of our customers require mortgage financing the availability of suitable mortgage financing could impair the affordability of our homes lower demand for our products and limit our ability to fully deliver our backlog 

our business and earnings depend on the ability of our potential customers to obtain mortgages for the purchase of our homes in addition many of our potential customers must sell their existing homes in order to buy a home from us the tightening of credit standards and the availability of suitable mortgage financing could prevent customers from buying our homes and could prevent buyers of our customers’ homes from obtaining mortgages they need to complete that purchase either of which could result in potential customers’ inability to buy a home from us if potential customers or the buyers of our customers’ current homes are not able to obtain suitable financing the result could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

if our ability to sell mortgages to investors is impaired we may be required to fund these commitments ourselves or we may not be able to originate loans at all 

our mortgage banking business sells all of the loans it originates into the secondary market usually within 30 days from the date of closing and has up to 150 million available under a repurchase agreement to fund mortgage closings see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – liquidity and capital resources” in item 7 of this form 10k for more information about the repurchase agreement in the event that disruptions to the secondary markets tighten or eliminate the available liquidity within the secondary markets for mortgage loans or the underwriting requirements by our secondary market investors continue to become more stringent our ability to sell future mortgages could decline and we could be required among other things to fund our commitments to our buyers with our own financial resources which is limited or require our home buyers to find another source of financing the result of such secondary market disruption could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

if the market value of our inventory or controlled lot position declines our profit could decrease and we may incur losses 

inventory risk can be substantial for homebuilders the market value of building lots and housing inventories can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing market conditions in addition inventory carrying costs can be significant and can result in losses in a poorly performing community or market we must continuously acquire lots for expansion into new markets as well as for replacement and expansion within our current markets which we generally accomplish by entering into lpas and paying forfeitable deposits under the lpas to developers for the contractual right to acquire the lots in the event of adverse changes in economic market or community conditions we may cease further building activities in certain communities or restructure existing lpas resulting in forfeiture of some or all of any remaining land contract deposit paid to the developer we may also have significant impairments of land under development the forfeiture of land contract deposits or inventory impairments may result in a loss that could have a material adverse effect on our profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

we face competition in our homebuilding and mortgage banking operations 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive we compete with numerous homebuilders of varying size ranging from local to national in scope some of whom have greater financial resources than we do we face competition 

• for suitable and desirable lots at acceptable prices 

• from selling incentives offered by competing builders within and across developments and 

• from the existing home resale market 

our homebuilding operations compete primarily on the basis of price location design quality service and reputation 

the mortgage banking industry is also competitive our main competition comes from national regional and local mortgage bankers credit unions banks and mortgage brokers in each of these markets our mortgage banking operations compete primarily on the basis of customer service variety of products offered interest rates offered prices of ancillary services and relative financing availability and costs 

we might not be able to continue to compete successfully in our homebuilding or mortgage banking operations an inability to effectively compete may have an adverse impact on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

our inability to secure and control an adequate inventory of lots could adversely impact our operations 

the results of our homebuilding operations depend upon our continuing ability to control an adequate number of homebuilding lots in desirable locations there can be no assurance that an adequate supply of building lots will continue to be available to us on terms similar to those available in the past or that we will not be required to devote a greater amount of capital to controlling building lots than we have historically an insufficient supply of building lots in one or more of our markets an inability of our developers to deliver finished lots in a timely fashion due to their inability to secure financing to fund development activities or for other reasons or our inability to purchase or finance building lots on reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

a shortage of building materials or labor or increases in materials or labor costs may adversely impact our operations 

the homebuilding business has from time to time experienced building material and labor shortages including fluctuating lumber prices and supply in addition strong construction market conditions could restrict the labor force available to our subcontractors and us in one or more of our markets significant increases in costs resulting from these shortages or delays in construction of homes could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

we rely on subcontractors to construct our homes the failure of our subcontractors to properly construct our homes may be costly 

we engage subcontractors to perform the actual construction of our homes despite our quality control efforts we may discover that our subcontractors have engaged in improper construction practices the occurrence of such events could require us to repair the homes in accordance with our standards and as required by law the cost of satisfying our legal obligations in these instances may be significant and we may be unable to recover the cost of repair from subcontractors suppliers and insurers 

product liability litigation and warranty claims may adversely impact our operations 

construction defect and home warranty claims are common and can represent a substantial risk for the homebuilding industry the cost of insuring against construction defect and product liability claims as well as the claims themselves can be high in addition insurance companies limit coverage offered to protect against these claims further restrictions on coverage availability or significant increases in premium costs or claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

we are subject to litigation proceedings that could harm our business if an unfavorable ruling were to occur 

from time to time we are involved in litigation and other legal proceedings relating to claims arising from our operations in the normal course of business as described in but not limited to item 3 “legal proceedings” of this form 10k we are currently subject to certain legal proceedings litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings may occur these or other litigation or legal proceedings could materially affect our ability to conduct our business in the manner that we expect or otherwise adversely affect us should an unfavorable ruling occur 

if the underwriting quality of our mortgage originations is found to be deficient our profit could decrease and we may incur losses 

we originate several different loan products to our customers to finance the purchase of their home we sell all of the loans we originate into the secondary mortgage market generally within 30 days from the date of closing all of the loans that we originate are 

underwritten to the standards and specifications of the ultimate investor insofar as we underwrite our originated loans to those standards we bear no increased concentration of credit risk from the issuance of loans except in certain limited instances where repurchases or early payment default occur in the event that a substantial number of the loans that we have originated fall into default and the investors to whom we sold the loans determine that we did not underwrite the loans in accordance with their requirements we could be required to repurchase the loans from the investor or indemnify the investor for any losses incurred any resulting losses could have a material adverse effect on our profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

we may be subject to claims on mortgage loans sold to third parties 

our mortgage banking operations may be responsible for losses associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to investors in the event of errors or omissions relating to certain representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements including representations as to underwriting standards the type of collateral the existence of private mortgage insurance and the validity of certain borrower representations in connection with the loan the resolution of claims related to alleged breaches of these representations and warranties and repurchase claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition cash flows and results of operations and could result in losses that exceed existing estimates and accruals because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating these matters there can be no assurance that any amounts reserved will be adequate or that any potential inadequacies will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

the loss of key personnel could adversely impact our business 

we rely on our key personnel to effectively operate and manage our business specifically our future success depends heavily on the performance of our senior management team our business may be adversely affected if we are unable to retain key personnel or attract qualified personnel to manage our business 

our failure to maintain the security of our electronic and other confidential information could expose us to liability and materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

privacy security and compliance concerns have continued to increase as technology has evolved as part of our normal business activities we collect and store certain confidential information including personal information of homebuyersborrowers and information about employees vendors and suppliers this information is entitled to protection under a number of federal and state laws we may share some of this information with vendors who assist us with certain aspects of our business particularly our mortgage and title businesses 

we have implemented systems and processes intended to secure our information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive confidential and personal data including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies additionally we have continued to elevate our monitoring capabilities to enhance early detection and rapid response to potential security anomalies in 2021 we had an external review of our cybersecurity program performed by a third party which allowed us to enhance our overall program we also require employees to complete training sessions regarding matters such as cybersecurity threats and data protection on a regular basis these security measures may not be sufficient for all possible occurrences and may be vulnerable to hacking employee error malfeasance system error faulty password management or other irregularities further development and maintenance of these measures are costly and require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become increasingly sophisticated 

our failure to maintain the security of the data we are required to protect including via the penetration of our network security and the misappropriation of confidential and personal information could result in business disruption damage to our reputation financial obligations to third parties fines penalties regulatory proceedings and private litigation with potentially large costs and also in deterioration in customers’ confidence in us and other competitive disadvantages and thus could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

volatility in the credit and capital markets may impact our ability to access necessary financing 

if we require working capital greater than that provided by our operations and our credit facility we may be required to seek to increase the amount available under the facility or seek alternative financing which might not be available on terms that are favorable or acceptable if we are required to seek financing to fund our working capital requirements volatility in credit or capital markets may restrict our flexibility to access financing if we are at any time unsuccessful in obtaining sufficient capital to fund our planned homebuilding expenditures we may experience a substantial delay in the completion of homes then under construction or we may be unable to control or purchase finished building lots any delay could result in cost increases and could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

our mortgage banking operations depend in part on the availability cost and other terms of mortgage financing facilities and may be adversely affected by any shortage or increased cost of such financing additional or replacement financing might not be available on terms that are favorable or acceptable our mortgage banking operations are also dependent upon the securitization market for mortgagebacked securities and could be materially adversely affected by any fluctuation or downturn in such market 

our current indebtedness may impact our future operations 

as of december 31 2021 we had 15 billion in senior notes outstanding our existing indebtedness contains restrictive covenants and any future indebtedness may also contain such covenants these covenants include or could include restrictions on our ability to create incur assume or guarantee secured debt enter into sale and leaseback transactions and conditions related to mergers andor the sale of assets substantial losses by us or other action or inaction by us or our subsidiaries could result in the violation of one or more of these covenants which could result in decreased liquidity or a default on our current or future indebtedness thereby having a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

regulatory risk 

government regulations and environmental matters could negatively affect our operations 

we are subject to various local state and federal statutes ordinances rules and regulations concerning zoning building design construction and similar matters including local regulations that impose restrictive zoning and density requirements in order to limit the number of homes that can eventually be built within the boundaries of a particular area these regulations may further increase the cost to produce and market our products in addition we have from time to time been subject to and may also be subject in the future to periodic delays in our homebuilding projects due to building moratoriums in the areas in which we operate or delays in receiving the necessary governmental approvals changes in regulations that restrict homebuilding activities in one or more of our principal markets could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

in addition new housing developments are often subject to various assessments or impact fees for schools parks streets highways and other public improvements the cost of these assessments is subject to substantial change and could cause increases in the construction cost of our homes which in turn could reduce our profitability 

we are also subject to a variety of local state and federal statutes ordinances rules and regulations concerning the protection of health and the environment we are subject to a variety of environmental conditions that can affect our business and our homebuilding projects the particular environmental laws that apply to any given homebuilding site vary greatly according to the location and environmental condition of the site and the present and former uses of the site and adjoining properties environmental laws and conditions may result in delays cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs or prohibit or severely restrict homebuilding activity in certain environmentally sensitive regions or areas thereby adversely affecting our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

increased regulation of the mortgage industry could harm our future sales and earnings 

the mortgage industry remains under intense scrutiny and continues to face increasing regulation at the federal state and local level potential changes to federal laws and regulations could have the effect of limiting the activities of fnma and fhlmc the entities that provide liquidity to the secondary mortgage market which could lead to increases in mortgage interest rates tighter underwriting requirements and fee restrictions and the increasingly complex regulatory environment may negatively impact our mortgage loan origination business in the form of lower demand decreased revenue and increased operating costs 

we are an approved sellerservicer of fnma and fhlmc mortgage loans and an approved sellerissuer of gnma va and fha mortgage loans and are subject to all of those agencies’ rules and regulations any significant impairment of our eligibility to sellservice these loans could have a material adverse impact on our mortgage operations in addition we are subject to regulation at the state and federal level with respect to specific origination selling and servicing practices including the real estate settlement and protection act adverse changes in governmental regulation may have a negative impact on our mortgage loan origination business 

risks related to the covid19 pandemic and other external risks 

health epidemics including the recent covid19 pandemic have had and could in the future have an adverse impact on our business and operations and the markets states and local communities in which we operate 

our business and operations could be adversely affected by health epidemics including the covid19 pandemic impacting the markets states and local communities in which we operate general uncertainty continues regarding the nearterm and longterm impact of the covid19 virus on the domestic and international economy and on public health these developments and other consequences of the outbreak could materially and adversely affect our operations profitability and cash flows 

the covid19 pandemic has had a significant impact on all facets of our business ou r primary focus during the pandemic has been to do everything we can to ensure the safety and wellbeing of our employees customers and trade partners in each of our markets we continue to operate in accordance with the guidelines issued by the centers for disease control and prevention as well as state and local guidelines 

the ultimate impact of the covid19 pandemic or a similar health epidemic is highly uncertain and subject to change there is uncertainty regarding governmental actions that may occur and the effects of economic relief efforts on the us economy either of which could be potential disruptors to our business over the long term these disruptions related to covid19 could lower demand for our products impair our ability to sell andor build homes in our normal manner increase our losses on contract land deposits and negatively impact our lending and secondary mortgage market activities 

while the spread of covid19 may eventually be mitigated there is no guarantee that a future outbreak of this or any other widespread epidemics will not occur or that the us economy will recover either of which could seriously harm our business 

weatherrelated and other events beyond our control may adversely impact our operations 

extreme weather or other events such as significant snowfalls hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes forest fires floods terrorist attacks or war may affect our markets our operations and our profitability these events may impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or subcontractors and our housing inventories causing us material increases in costs or delays in construction of homes which could have a material adverse effect upon our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

our continued success is dependent on positive perceptions of us and our brands which if eroded could adversely affect our business and our relationships with our customers 

we believe that one of the reasons our customers buy from us our employees choose nvr as a place of employment and our vendors choose to do business with us is the reputation we have built over many years to be successful in the future we must continue to preserve our reputation reputational value is based in large part on perceptions and broad access to social media makes it easy for anyone to provide public feedback that can influence perceptions of the brands under which we do business it may be difficult to control negative publicity regardless of whether it is accurate while reputations may take decades to build negative incidents can quickly erode trust and confidence could damage our reputation reduce the demand for our homes or negatively impact the morale and performance of our employees all of which could adversely affect our business

overview 

business environment and current outlook 

demand for new homes remained strong across each of our markets throughout 2021 driven by historically low mortgage rates and limited housing supply as a result we were able to consistently increase prices throughout the year allowing us to improve profitability despite rising lumber and other material costs and labor costs additionally strong housing demand has resulted in increased construction activity and demand for building materials and contractor labor which coupled with the ongoing effects of the covid19 pandemic has led to supply chain disruptions and longer construction cycle times we expect to continue to face these disruptions well into 2022 and continue to work closely with our suppliers and trade partners to manage these disruptions 

although current demand for new homes is strong there is uncertainty regarding the extent and timing of the supply chain disruption and the effects of the ongoing pandemic and related economic relief efforts on the us economy inflation unemployment consumer confidence demand for new homes and home affordability we expect to continue to face cost pressures related to building materials particularly lumber as well as labor and land costs as a result profit margins will be impacted based on our ability to manage these costs while balancing sales pace and pricing although we are unable to predict the extent to which this will impact our operational and financial performance we believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities that may arise from future economic and homebuilding market volatility due to the strength of our balance sheet 

business 

our primary business is the construction and sale of singlefamily detached homes townhomes and condominium buildings all of which are primarily constructed on a presold basis to fully serve customers of our homebuilding operations we also operate a mortgage banking and title services business we primarily conduct our operations in mature markets additionally we generally grow our business through market share gains in our existing markets and by expanding into markets contiguous to our current active markets our four homebuilding reportable segments consist of the following regions   



our lot acquisition strategy is predicated upon avoiding the financial risks associated with direct land ownership and development we generally do not engage in land development see discussion below of our land development activities instead we typically acquire finished lots from various third party land developers pursuant to lpas these lpas require deposits typically ranging up to 10 of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots in the form of cash or letters of credit that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the lpa this strategy has allowed us to maximize inventory turnover which we believe enables us to minimize market risk and to operate with less capital thereby enhancing rates of return on equity and total capital 

in addition to constructing homes primarily on a presold basis and utilizing what we believe is a conservative lot acquisition strategy we focus on obtaining and maintaining a leading market position in each market we serve this strategy allows us to gain valuable efficiencies and competitive advantages in our markets which we believe contributes to minimizing the adverse effects of regional economic cycles and provides growth opportunities within these markets our continued success is contingent upon our ability to control an adequate supply of finished lots on which to build 

in limited specific strategic circumstances we deviate from our historical lot acquisition strategy and engage in joint venture arrangements with land developers or directly acquire raw ground already zoned for its intended use for development once we acquire control of raw ground we determine whether to sell the raw parcel to a developer and enter into an lpa with the developer to purchase the finished lots or to hire a developer to develop the land on our behalf while joint venture arrangements and direct land development activity are not our preferred method of acquiring finished building lots we may enter into additional transactions in the future on a limited basis where there exists a compelling strategic or prudent financial reason to do so we expect however to continue to acquire substantially all of our finished lot inventory using lpas with forfeitable deposits 

as of december 31 2021 we controlled approximately 124900 lots as discussed below 

lot purchase agreements lpas 

we controlled approximately 122800 lots under lpas with third parties through deposits in cash and letters of credit totaling approximately 521900 and 10100 respectively included in the number of controlled lots are approximately 4900 lots for which we have recorded a contract land deposit impairment reserve of approximately 30000 as of december 31 2021 

joint venture limited liability corporations “jvs” 

we had an aggregate investment totaling approximately 20300 in four jvs expected to produce approximately 2300 lots of the lots to be produced by the jvs approximately 1900 lots were controlled by us and approximately 400 lots were either under contract with unrelated parties or currently not under contract 

land under development 

we owned land with a carrying value of approximately 12100 that we intend to develop into approximately 200 finished lots we had additional funding commitments of approximately 2700 under a joint development agreement related to one project a portion of which we expect will be offset by development credits of approximately 800 

see notes 3 4 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information regarding lpas jvs and land under development respectively 

raw land purchase agreements 

in addition to the lots we currently control as discussed above we have certain properties under contract with land owners that are expected to yield approximately 15500 lots some of these properties may require rezoning or other approvals to achieve the expected yield these properties are controlled with cash deposits totaling approximately 5300 as of december 31 2021 of which approximately 3400 is refundable if we do not perform under the contract we generally expect to assign the raw land contracts to a land developer and simultaneously enter into an lpa with the assignee if the project is determined to be feasible 

key financial results 

our consolidated revenues for the year ended december 31 2021 totaled 8951025 an increase of 19 from 7536923 in 2020 our net income for 2021 was 1236719 or 32048 per diluted share increases of 37 and 39 compared to 2020 net income and diluted earnings per share respectively our homebuilding gross profit margin percentage was 223 in 2021 compared to 190 in 2020 settlements for the year ended december 31 2021 totaled 21540 units an increase of 9 from 2020 new orders net of cancellations “new orders” during 2021 were 22721 a decrease of 2 from 2020 while our average new order sales price increased 15 to 4361 in 2021 our backlog of homes sold but not yet settled with the customer as of december 31 2021 increased on a unit basis by 10 to 12730 units and increased on a dollar basis by 26 to 5782035 when compared to december 31 2020 income before tax from our mortgage banking segment totaled 171604 in 2021 an increase of 23 when compared to 140073 in 2020 due primarily to an increase in secondary marketing gains on sales of loans 

homebuilding operations 

the following table summarizes the results of our consolidated homebuilding operations and certain operating activity for each of the last three years 



consolidated homebuilding 

homebuilding revenues increased 19 in 2021 compared to 2020 as a result of a 9 increase in both the number of units settled and in the average settlement price year over year the increase in the number of units settled was attributable to a 40 higher backlog unit balance entering 2021 compared to the backlog unit balance entering 2020 offset partially by a lower backlog turnover rate year over year the increase in the average settlement price was primarily attributable to a 4 higher average sales price of units in backlog entering 2021 compared to backlog entering 2020 coupled with a 15 increase in the average sales price of new orders in the first six months of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 the gross profit margin percentage in 2021 increased to 223 from 190 in 2020  gross profit margins were favorably impacted by the increase in the average settlement price attributable to improved pricing power in prior quarters and improved leveraging of certain operating costs attributable to the increase in settlement activity year over year these favorable factors were partially offset by higher prices for lumber certain other commodities and labor year over year 

the number of new orders decreased 2 while the average sales price of new orders increased 15 in 2021 when compared to 2020 the number of new orders in the current year were lower due primarily to a 9 decrease in the average number of active communities year over year the increase in the average sales price of new orders was primarily attributable to favorable market conditions which coupled with low housing inventory levels drove demand and provided us sustained pricing power since the second half of 2020 

selling general and administrative sga expenses in 2021 increased by 43800 compared to 2020 but as a percentage of revenue decreased to 55 in 2021 from 59 in 2020 due to improved leveraging of sga costs the increase in sga expense year over year was attributable primarily to increased incentive compensation attributable to stronger performance year over year as well as increased personnel costs due to increased headcount 

our backlog represents homes sold but not yet settled with our customers backlog units and dollars were 12730 units and 5782035 respectively as of december 31 2021 compared to 11549 units and 4575899 respectively as of december 31 2020 backlog units were higher despite an 11 decrease in new orders during the sixmonth period ending december 31 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 due to a lower backlog turnover rate year over year our backlog turnover rate was negatively impacted by a longer production cycle attributable to supply chain disruptions and subcontractor capacity constraints backlog dollars were higher due to a 15 increase in the average sales price of new orders during the sixmonth period ended december 31 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 

in addition to the impact of the covid19 pandemic our backlog may be impacted by customer cancellations for various reasons that are beyond our control such as failure to obtain mortgage financing inability to sell an existing home job loss or a variety of other reasons in any period a portion of the cancellations that we experience are related to new sales that occurred during the same period and a portion are related to sales that occurred in prior periods and therefore appeared in the beginning backlog for the current period additionally a substantial majority of our cancellations occur prior to starting construction on a home expressed as the total of all cancellations during the period as a percentage of gross new orders during the period our cancellation rate was 92 149 and 146 in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively additionally approximately 3 in 2021 and 6 in both 2020 and 2019 of a reporting quarter’s opening backlog cancelled during the quarter we can provide no assurance that our historical cancellation rates are indicative of the actual cancellation rate that may occur in future years other than those units that are cancelled and subject to potential construction delays resulting from covid19 related restrictions andor continued supply chain disruptions we expect to settle substantially all of our december 31 2021 backlog during 2022 see “risk factors” in item 1a of this form 10k 

the backlog turnover rate is impacted by various factors including but not limited to changes in new order activity internal production capacity external subcontractor capacity and other external factors over which we do not exercise control 

reportable homebuilding segments 

homebuilding segment profit includes all revenues and income generated from the sale of homes less the cost of homes sold sga expenses and a corporate capital allocation charge determined by corporate management the corporate capital allocation charge eliminates in consolidation and is based on the segment’s average net assets employed the corporate capital allocation charged to the operating segment allows the chief operating decision maker to determine whether the operating segment is providing the desired rate of return after covering our cost of capital 

we record impairment charges on contract land deposits when we determine that it is probable that recovery of the deposit is impaired for segment reporting purposes impairments on contract land deposits are generally charged to the operating segment upon the termination of an lpa with the developer or the restructuring of an lpa resulting in the forfeiture of the deposit we evaluate our entire net contract land deposit portfolio for impairment each quarter for presentation purposes below the contract land deposit reserve at december 31 2021 and 2020 has been allocated to the reportable segments for the respective years to show contract land deposits on a net basis the net contract land deposit balances below also include approximately 10100 and 8100 at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively of letters of credit issued as deposits in lieu of cash 

the following tables summarize certain homebuilding operating activity by reportable segment for each of the last three years 

selected segment financial data

lots controlled and land deposits 







mid atlantic 

the mid atlantic segment had an approximate 297100 or 68 increase in segment profit in 2021 compared to 2020 driven by improved gross profit margins and an increase in segment revenues of approximately 381300 or 10 year over year segment revenues increased due primarily to an 11 increase in the average settlement price year over year the increase in the average settlement price was primarily attributable to a 7 higher average sales price of units in backlog entering 2021 compared to backlog entering 2020 coupled with a 17 increase in the average sales price of new orders in the first six months of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 the mid atlantic segment’s gross profit margin percentage increased to 244 in 2021 from 188 in 2020 gross profit margins were favorably impacted by the increase in the average settlement price attributable to improved pricing power and improved leveraging of certain operating costs attributable to the increase in settlement activity year over year these favorable factors were partially offset by higher prices for lumber certain other commodities and labor year over year 

segment new orders decreased 5 while the average sales price of new orders increased 15 in 2021 compared to 2020 new orders were negatively impacted primarily by a 13 decrease in the average number of active communities year over year the increase in the average sales price of new orders year over year was attributable to favorable market conditions which coupled with low housing inventory levels drove demand and have provided us sustained pricing power since the second half of 2020   

north east

segment new orders decreased 3 while the average sales price of new orders increased 19 in 2021 compared to 2020 new orders were negatively impacted primarily by a 13 decrease in the average number of active communities year over year the increase in the average sales price of new orders year over year was attributable to favorable market conditions which coupled with low housing inventory levels drove demand and provided us sustained pricing power since the second half of 2020 

mid east 

the mid east segment had an approximate 103200 or 61 increase in segment profit in 2021 compared to 2020 the increase in segment profit was driven by an increase of segment revenues of approximately 367100 or 24 year over year and improved gross profit margins segment revenues increased due to increases in the number of units settled and the average settlement price of 15 and 8 respectively year over year the increase in the number of units settled was largely attributable to a 59 higher backlog unit balance entering 2021 compared to the backlog unit balance entering 2020 offset partially by a lower backlog turnover rate year over year the increase in the average settlement price was primarily attributable to a 4 higher average sales price of units in backlog entering 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 coupled with a 13 increase in the average sales price of new orders in the first six months of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 the segment’s gross profit margin percentage increased to 207 in 2021 from 185 in 2020 gross profit margins were favorably impacted by the increase in the average settlement price attributable to improved pricing power and by improved leveraging of certain operating costs attributable to the increase in settlement activity year over year offset partially by higher prices for lumber certain other commodities and labor year over year 

segment new orders decreased 4 while the average sales price of new orders increased 12 in 2021 compared to 2020 new orders were negatively impacted primarily by a 7 decrease in the average number of active communities in 2021 compared to 2020 the increase in the average sales price of new orders was attributable to favorable market conditions which coupled with low housing inventory levels drove demand and provided us sustained pricing power since the second half of 2020 

south east 

the south east segment had an approximate 125000 or 61 increase in segment profit in 2021 compared to 2020 the increase in segment profit was primarily driven by an increase in segment revenues of approximately 395400 or 25 year over year and improved gross profit margins the increase in revenues was attributable to a 16 increase in the number of units settled and an 8 increase in the average settlement price year over year the number of units settled were favorably impacted by a 46 higher backlog unit balance entering 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 offset partially by a lower backlog turnover rate year over year the increase in the average settlement price was primarily attributable to a 3 higher average sales price of units in backlog entering 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 coupled with a 16 increase in the average sales price of new orders in the first six months of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 the segment’s gross profit margin percentage increased to 236 in 2021 from 205 in 2020 gross profit margins were favorably impacted by the increase in the average settlement price attributable to improved pricing power and improved leveraging of certain operating costs attributable to the increase in settlement activity year over year these favorable factors were partially offset by higher prices for lumber certain other commodities and labor year over year 

segment new orders and the average sales price of new orders increased 6 and 18 respectively in 2021 compared to 2020 new orders and the average sales price of new orders were higher due to favorable market conditions which coupled with low housing inventory levels drove demand and provided us sustained pricing power since the second half of 2020 

homebuilding segment reconciliations to consolidated homebuilding operations 

in addition to the corporate capital allocation and contract land deposit impairments discussed above the other reconciling items between homebuilding segment profit and homebuilding consolidated profit before tax include unallocated corporate overhead which includes all management incentive compensation equitybased compensation expense consolidation adjustments and external corporate interest expense our overhead functions such as accounting treasury and human resources are centrally performed and the costs are not allocated to our operating segments consolidation adjustments consist of such items to convert the reportable segments’ results which are predominantly maintained on a cash basis to a full accrual basis for external financial statement presentation purposes and are not allocated to our operating segments external corporate interest expense is primarily comprised of interest charges on our 395 senior notes due 2022 and 300 senior notes due 2030 and is not charged to the operating segments because the charges are included in the corporate capital allocation discussed above 



  



  

1 this item represents changes to the contract land deposit impairment reserve which are not allocated to the reportable segments see further discussion of contract land deposit impairment charges in note 3 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

2 the decrease in equitybased compensation expense in 2020 was primarily attributable to stock options issued in 2014 under the 2014 equity incentive plan becoming fully vested in 2019 in addition there were higher stock option forfeitures in 2020 compared to 2019 

3 this item represents the elimination of the corporate capital allocation charge included in the respective homebuilding reportable segments the corporate capital allocation charge is based on the segment’s monthly average asset balance and is as follows for the years presented 



4 the decrease in consolidation adjustments and other in 2021 compared to 2020 is driven by changes in lumber prices in 2021 our reportable segments results include intercompany profits of our production facilities for home packages delivered to our homebuilding divisions for homes not yet settled these intercompany profits are reversed through the consolidation adjustments due to the significantly higher lumber prices in the first half of 2021 the previously reversed intercompany profits were recognized in subsequent quarters through the consolidation adjustment as homes were settled and our consolidated homebuilding margins were negatively impacted by the higher lumber costs 

mortgage banking segment 

we conduct our mortgage banking activity through nvrm a wholly owned subsidiary nvrm focuses almost exclusively on serving the homebuilding segment customer base the following table summarizes the results of our mortgage banking operations and certain statistical data for each of the last three years 



loan closing volume in 2021 increased by approximately 756100 or 14 from 2020 the increase was primarily attributable to a 6 increase in the number of loans closed year over year due primarily to the aforementioned increase in the homebuilding segment’s number of settlements in 2021 as compared to 2020 and an 8 increase in the average loan amount in 2021 compared to 2020 

segment profit in 2021 increased by approximately 32900 or 23 from 2020 the increase in segment profit was primarily attributable to an increase in mortgage banking fees mortgage banking fees increased by approximately 41300 or 20 resulting from the aforementioned increase in loan closing volume and an increase in secondary marketing gains on sales of loans 

mortgage banking – other 

we sell all of the loans we originate into the secondary mortgage market insofar as we underwrite our originated loans to the standards and specifications of the ultimate investor we have no further financial obligations from the issuance of loans except in certain limited instances where repurchases or early payment default occur those underwriting standards are typically equal to or more stringent than the underwriting standards required by fnma gnma fhlmc va and fha because we sell all of our loans and do not service them there is often a substantial delay between the time that a loan goes into default and the time that the investor requests us to reimburse them for losses incurred because of the default we believe that all of the loans that we originate are underwritten to the standards and specifications of the ultimate investor to whom we sell our originated loans we employ a quality control department to ensure that our underwriting controls are effective and further assess the underwriting function as part of our assessment of internal controls over financial reporting 

we maintain a reserve for losses on mortgage loans originated that reflects our judgment of the present loss exposure from the loans that we have originated and sold at december 31 2021 and 2020 we had repurchase reserves of approximately 21400 and 20500 respectively 

nvrm is dependent on our homebuilding operation’s customers for business if new orders and selling prices of the homebuilding segment decline nvrm’s operations will also be adversely affected in addition nvrm’s operating results may be adversely affected in future periods due to tightening and volatility of the credit markets changes in investor funding times increased regulation of mortgage lending practices and increased competition in the mortgage market 

seasonality 

we generally have higher new order activity in the first half of the year and higher home settlements revenues and net income in the second half of the year however the impact of the pandemic in both 2021 and 2020 on home demand as well as supply chain disruptions have affected our typical seasonal new order and settlement trends 

effective tax rate 

our consolidated effective tax rates in 2021 and 2020 were 2224 and 1640 respectively the higher effective tax rate in 2021 was attributable primarily to the recognition of a lower income tax benefit related to excess tax benefits from stock option exercises in 2021 excess tax benefit recognized in 2021 and 2020 were approximately 48400 and 92200 respectively 

we expect continued tax rate volatility in future years attributable to the recognition of excess tax benefits from equity plan activity and distributions from the deferred compensation plans 

recent accounting pronouncements pending adoption 

see note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements applicable to us 

liquidity and capital resources 

we fund our operations primarily from our current cash holdings and cash flows generated by operating activities in addition we have available a shortterm unsecured working capital revolving credit facility and revolving mortgage repurchase facility as further described below as of december 31 2021 we had a strong liquidity position with approximately 2600000 in cash and cash equivalents approximately 284000 in unused committed capacity under our revolving credit facility and 150000 in unused committed capacity under our revolving mortgage repurchase facility 

material cash requirements 

we believe that our current cash holdings cash generated from operations and cash available under our shortterm unsecured credit agreement and revolving mortgage repurchase facility as well as the public debt and equity markets will be sufficient to satisfy both our short term and long term cash requirements for working capital to support our daily operations and meet commitments under our contractual obligations with third parties our material contractual obligations primarily consist of i payments due to service our debt and interest on that debt during 2022 we expect to use cash holdings to repurchase or retire 600000 in senior notes maturing in september 2022 future interest payments on our outstanding senior notes total approximately 242800 with approximately 43700 due within twelve months ii payment obligations totaling approximately 300000 under existing lpas for deposits to be paid to land developers assuming that contractual development milestones are met by the developers and we exercise our option to acquire finished lots under those lpas we expect to make the majority of these payments within the next three years and iii obligations under operating and finance leases related primarily to office space and our production facilities see part i item 2 and note 13 of this form 10k for additional discussion of our properties and leases respectively 

in addition to funding growth in our homebuilding and mortgage banking operations we historically have used a substantial portion of our excess liquidity to repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock in open market and privately negotiated transactions this ongoing repurchase program assists us in accomplishing our primary objective creating increases in shareholder value see “market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities” in item 5 of this form 10k for disclosure of amounts repurchased during the fourth quarter of 2021 for the year ended december 31 2021 we repurchased 322038 shares of our common stock at an aggregate purchase price of 1538019 as of december 31 2021 we had approximately 508000 available under board approved repurchase authorizations 

capital resources

credit agreement 

we have a unsecured revolving credit agreement the credit agreement with a group of lenders which may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes the credit agreement provides for aggregate revolving loan commitments of 300000 the facility under the credit agreement we may request increases of up to 300000 to the facility in the form of revolving loan commitments or term loans to the extent that new or existing lenders agree to provide additional revolving loan or term loan commitments in addition the credit agreement provides for a 100000 sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit of which there was approximately 16100 outstanding at december 31 2021 the credit agreement termination date is february 12 2026 there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement as of december 31 2021 

repurchase agreement 

our mortgage banking subsidiary nvrm has an unsecured revolving mortgage repurchase agreement the repurchase agreement which is nonrecourse to nvr the purpose of the repurchase agreement is to finance the origination of mortgage loans by nvrm the repurchase agreement provides borrowing capacity up to 150000 subject to certain sublimits the repurchase agreement expires on july 20 2022 at december 31 2021 there was no debt outstanding under the repurchase agreement and there were no borrowing base limitations 

see note 9 of this form 10k for additional disclosures regarding our senior notes credit agreement and repurchase agreement 

cash flows

critical accounting policies and estimates 

general 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods we continually evaluate the estimates we use to prepare the consolidated financial statements and update those estimates as necessary in general our estimates are based on historical experience on information from third party professionals and other various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances actual results could differ materially from those estimates made by management 

homebuilding inventory 

the carrying value of inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market value cost of lots and completed and uncompleted housing units represent the accumulated actual cost of the units field construction supervisors’ salaries and related direct overhead expenses are included in inventory costs interest costs are not capitalized into inventory with the exception of land under development and joint venture investments as applicable upon settlement the cost of the unit is expensed on a specific identification basis cost of building materials is determined on a firstin firstout basis 

sold inventory is evaluated for impairment based on the contractual sales price compared to the total estimated cost to construct unsold inventory is evaluated for impairment by analyzing recent comparable sales prices within the applicable community compared to the costs incurred to date plus the expected costs to complete any calculated impairments are recorded immediately in cost of sales 

contract land deposits 

we purchase finished lots under lpas that require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the contract the deposits are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percentage of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots 

we maintain an allowance for losses on contract land deposits that reflects our judgment of the present loss exposure in the existing contract land deposit portfolio at the end of the reporting period to analyze contract land deposit impairments we conduct a loss contingency analysis each quarter in addition to considering market and economic conditions we assess contract land deposit impairments on a communitybycommunity basis pursuant to the purchase contract terms analyzing quantitative and qualitative information including as applicable current sales absorption levels recent sales’ profit margin the dollar differential between the contractual purchase price and the current market price for lots a developer’s performance a developer’s financial ability or willingness to reduce lot prices to current market prices if necessary and the contract’s default status by either us or the developer along with an analysis of the expected outcome of any such default 

our analysis is focused on whether we can sell houses at an acceptable profit margin and sales pace in a particular community in the current market with which we are faced because we do not own the finished lots on which we had placed a contract land deposit if the above analysis leads to a determination that we cannot sell homes at an acceptable profit margin and sales pace at the current contractual lot price we then determine whether we will elect to default under the contract forfeit our deposit and terminate the contract or whether we will attempt to restructure the lpa which may require us to forfeit the deposit to obtain contract concessions from a developer we also assess whether an impairment is present due to collectability issues resulting from a developer’s nonperformance because of financial or other conditions 

although we consider the allowance for losses on contract land deposits reflected on the december 31 2021 consolidated balance sheet to be adequate see note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included herein there can be no assurance that this allowance will prove to be adequate over time to cover losses due to unanticipated adverse changes in the economy or other events adversely affecting specific markets or the homebuilding industry 

warrantyproduct liability reserves 

we establish warranty and product liability reserves to provide for estimated future expenses as a result of construction and product defects product recalls and litigation incidental to our homebuilding business liability estimates are determined based on our judgment considering such factors as historical experience the likely current cost of corrective action manufacturers’ and 

subcontractors’ participation in sharing the cost of corrective action consultations with third party experts such as engineers and discussions with our general counsel and outside counsel retained to handle specific product liability cases although we consider the warranty and product liability accrual reflected on the december 31 2021 consolidated balance sheet to be adequate see note 14 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included herein there can be no assurance that this accrual will prove to be adequate over time to cover losses due to increased costs for material and labor the inability or refusal of manufacturers or subcontractors to financially participate in corrective action unanticipated adverse legal settlements or other unanticipated changes to the assumptions used to estimate the warranty and product liability accrual 

equitybased compensation 

we recognize equitybased compensation expense within our income statement for all sharebased payment arrangements which include nonqualified stock options to purchase shares of nvr common stock options and restricted share units rsus compensation expense is based on the grantdate fair value of the options and rsus granted and is recognized on a straightline basis over the requisite service period for the entire award from the date of grant through the period of the last separately vesting portion of the grant options and rsus which are subject to a performance condition are treated as a separate award from the “serviceonly” options and rsus and compensation expense is recognized when it becomes probable that the stated performance target will be achieved we calculate the fair value of our options which are nonpublicly traded using the blackscholes optionpricing model the grant date fair value of the rsus is the closing price of our common stock on the day immediately preceding the date of grant the reversal of compensation expense previously recognized for grants forfeited is recorded in the period in which the forfeiture occurs 

as noted above we calculate the fair value of our options which are nonpublicly traded using the blackscholes optionpricing model while the blackscholes model is a widely accepted method to calculate the fair value of options its results are dependent on input variables two of which expected term and expected volatility are significantly dependent on management’s judgment we have concluded that our historical exercise experience is the best estimate of future exercise patterns to determine an option’s expected term to estimate expected volatility we analyze the historical volatility of our common stock over a period equal to the option’s expected term changes in management’s judgment of the expected term and the expected volatility could have a material effect on the grantdate fair value calculated and expensed within the income statement 

in addition when recognizing equitybased compensation cost related to “performance condition” option and rsu grants we are required to make a determination as to whether the performance conditions will be met prior to the completion of the actual performance period the performance metric is based on our return on capital performance during a specified three year period based on the date of option grant while we currently believe that this performance condition will be satisfied at the target level and are recognizing compensation expense related to such options and rsus accordingly our future expected activity levels could cause us to make a different determination resulting in a change to the compensation expense to be recognized related to performance condition option and rsu grants that would otherwise have been recognized to date 

although we believe that the compensation costs recognized in 2021 are representative of the cumulative ratable amortization of the grantdate fair value of unvested options and rsus outstanding changes to the estimated input values such as expected term and expected volatility and changes to the determination of whether performance condition grants will vest could produce widely different expense valuations and recognition 

mortgage repurchase reserve 

we originate several different loan products to our customers to finance the purchase of their home we sell all of the loans we originate into the secondary mortgage market on a servicing released basis typically within 30 days from closing all of the loans that we originate are underwritten to the standards and specifications of the ultimate investor those underwriting standards are typically equal to or more stringent than the underwriting standards required by fnma gnma fhlmc va and fha insofar as we underwrite our originated loans to those standards we bear no increased concentration of credit risk from the issuance of loans except in certain limited instances where repurchases or early payment default occur we employ a quality control department to ensure that our underwriting controls are effectively operating and further assess the underwriting function as part of our assessment of internal controls over financial reporting we maintain a reserve for losses on mortgage loans originated that reflects our judgment of the present loss exposure in the loans that we have originated and sold the reserve is calculated based on an analysis of historical experience and exposure although we consider the mortgage repurchase reserve reflected on the december 31 2021 consolidated balance sheet to be adequate see note 16 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included herein there can be no assurance that this reserve will prove to be adequate over time to cover losses due to unanticipated changes to the assumptions used to estimate the mortgage repurchase reserve

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

 dollars in thousands 

market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates our market risk arises from interest rate risk inherent in our financial instruments and debt obligations interest rate risk results from the possibility that changes in interest rates will cause unfavorable changes in net income or in the value of interest ratesensitive assets liabilities and commitments lower interest rates tend to increase demand for mortgage loans for home purchasers while higher interest rates make it more difficult for potential borrowers to purchase residential properties and to qualify for mortgage loans we have no market rate sensitive instruments held for speculative or trading purposes 

we are exposed to interest rate risk as it relates to our fixed rate debt primarily our senior notes and our variable rate credit facility and loan repurchase facility changes to interest rates generally affect the fair value of fixedrate debt instruments but not earnings or cash flows for variable rate debt interest rate changes generally will not affect the fair value of the variable debt instruments but will affect earnings and cash flow at december 31 2021 there was no debt outstanding under our credit facility or loan repurchase facility see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included herein for further discussion of these debt instruments 

our mortgage banking segment is exposed to interest rate risk as it relates to its lending activities including originating mortgage loans and providing rate lock commitments to borrowers to mitigate the effect of the interest rate risk inherent in providing rate lock commitments to borrowers we enter into optional or mandatory delivery forward sales contracts to sell whole loans and mortgagebacked securities to investors the forward sales contracts lockin a range of interest rates and prices for the sale of loans similar to the specific rate lock commitments we do not engage in speculative or trading derivative activities all of the mortgage banking segment’s loan portfolio is held for sale and subject to forward sale commitments see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note 15 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included herein for further discussion of these items 

the following table represents the contractual balances of our onbalance sheet financial instruments at the expected maturity dates as well as the fair values of those onbalance sheet financial instruments at december 31 2021 the expected maturity categories take into consideration the actual and anticipated amortization of principal and do not take into consideration the reinvestment of cash or the refinancing of existing indebtedness because we sell all of the mortgage loans we originate into the secondary markets we have made the assumption that the portfolio of mortgage loans held for sale will mature in the first year

part iv 




 item 1 business 

general 

nvr inc a virginia corporation was formed in 1980 as nvhomes inc our primary business is the construction and sale of singlefamily detached homes townhomes and condominium buildings all of which are primarily constructed on a presold basis to more fully serve customers of our homebuilding operations we also operate a mortgage banking and title services business we conduct our homebuilding activities directly our mortgage banking operations are operated primarily through a wholly owned subsidiary nvr mortgage finance inc “nvrm” unless the context otherwise requires references to “nvr” “we” “us” or “our” include nvr inc and its consolidated subsidiaries 

we are one of the largest homebuilders in the united states we operate in thirtythree metropolitan areas in fourteen states and washington dc during 2020 approximately 18 and 7 of our home settlements occurred in the washington dc and baltimore md metropolitan areas respectively which accounted for approximately 24 and 10 respectively of our 2020 homebuilding revenues our homebuilding operations include the construction and sale of singlefamily detached homes townhomes and condominium buildings under three trade names ryan homes nvhomes and heartland homes our ryan homes product is marketed primarily to firsttime and firsttime moveup buyers ryan homes operates in thirtythree metropolitan areas located in maryland virginia washington dc west virginia pennsylvania new york north carolina south carolina florida ohio new jersey delaware indiana illinois and tennessee our nvhomes and heartland homes products are marketed primarily to moveup and luxury buyers nvhomes operates in delaware and the washington dc baltimore md and philadelphia pa metropolitan areas heartland homes operates in the pittsburgh pa metropolitan area 

we generally do not engage in land development see discussion below of our land development activities instead we typically acquire finished building lots from various third party land developers pursuant to fixed price finished lot purchase agreements “lpas” that require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the lpas the deposits required under the lpas are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and typically range up to 10 of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots 

we believe that our lot acquisition strategy avoids the financial requirements and risks associated with direct land ownership and land development we may at our option choose for any reason and at any time not to perform under these lpas by delivering notice of our intent not to acquire the finished lots under contract our sole legal obligation and economic loss for failure to perform under these lpas is limited to the amount of the deposit pursuant to the liquidated damage provision contained within the lpas we do not have any financial guarantees or completion obligations and we typically do not guarantee lot purchases on a specific performance basis under these lpas none of the creditors of any of the development entities with which we have entered these lpas have recourse to our general credit we generally seek to maintain control over a supply of lots believed to be suitable to meet our fiveyear business plan 

in addition to constructing homes primarily on a presold basis and utilizing what we believe is a conservative lot acquisition strategy we focus on obtaining and maintaining a leading market position in each market we serve this strategy allows us to gain valuable efficiencies and competitive advantages in our markets which we believe contributes to minimizing the adverse effects of regional economic cycles and provides growth opportunities within these markets our continued success is contingent upon our ability to control an adequate supply of finished lots on which to build as a result in certain specific strategic circumstances we deviate from our historical lot acquisition strategy and engage in joint venture arrangements with land developers or directly acquire raw ground already zoned for its intended use for development once we acquire control of raw ground we determine whether to sell the raw parcel to a developer and enter into an lpa with the developer to purchase the finished lots or hire a developer to develop the land on our behalf while joint venture arrangements and direct land development activity are not our preferred method of acquiring finished building lots we may enter into additional transactions in the future on a limited basis where there exists a compelling strategic or prudent financial reason to do so we expect however to continue to acquire substantially all of our finished lot inventory using lpas with forfeitable deposits see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 of this form 10k for additional discussion of lots controlled in addition see notes 3 4 and 5 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information regarding lpas joint ventures and land under development respectively 

in addition to building and selling homes we provide a number of mortgagerelated services through our mortgage banking operations through operations in each of our homebuilding markets nvrm originates mortgage loans almost exclusively for our homebuyers nvrm generates revenues primarily from origination fees gains on sales of loans and title fees nvrm sells all of the mortgage loans it closes into the secondary markets on a servicing released basis 

segment information for our homebuilding and mortgage banking businesses is included in note 2 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

homebuilding 

products 

we offer singlefamily detached homes townhomes and condominium buildings with many different basic home designs these home designs have a variety of elevations and numerous other options our homes combine traditional transitional cottage or urban exterior designs with contemporary interior designs and amenities generally include two to four bedrooms and range from approximately 1000 to 9000 finished square feet during 2020 the prices at which we settled homes ranged from approximately 140000 to 15 million and averaged 370800 during 2019 our average price of homes settled was 367100 

markets 

our four reportable homebuilding segments operate in the following geographic regions 



backlog 

backlog which represents homes sold but not yet settled with the customer totaled 11549 units and approximately 46 billion at december 31 2020 compared to 8233 units and approximately 31 billion at december 31 2019 backlog may be impacted by customer cancellations for various reasons that are beyond our control such as the customer’s failure to obtain mortgage financing inability to sell an existing home job loss or a variety of other reasons in any period a portion of the cancellations that we experience are related to new sales that occurred during the same period and a portion are related to sales that occurred in prior periods and therefore appeared in the opening backlog for the current period expressed as the total of all cancellations during the period as a percentage of gross sales during the period our cancellation rate was 149 146 and 145 in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively additionally approximately 6 in both 2020 and 2019 and 5 in 2018 of a reporting quarter’s opening backlog balance cancelled during the quarter we can provide no assurance that our historical cancellation rates are indicative of the actual cancellation rate that may occur in future periods other than those units that are cancelled we expect to settle substantially all of our december 31 2020 backlog during 2021 see “risk factors” in item 1a and “seasonality” in item 7 of this form 10k 

further discussion of settlements new orders and backlog activity by our homebuilding reportable segment for each of the last three years can be found in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 of this form 10k 

construction 

we utilize independent subcontractors under fixed price contracts to perform construction work on our homes we use many independent subcontractors in our various markets and we are not dependent on any single subcontractor or on a small number of subcontractors 

sales and marketing 

our preferred marketing method is for customers to visit a furnished model home featuring many builtin options and a landscaped lot the garages of these model homes are usually converted into temporary sales centers where alternative facades and floor plans are displayed and designs for other models are available for review sales representatives are compensated predominantly on a commission basis 

regulation 

we and our subcontractors must comply with various federal state and local zoning building environmental advertising and consumer credit statutes rules and regulations as well as other regulations and requirements in connection with our construction and sales activities all of these regulations have increased the cost to produce and market our products and in some instances have delayed our developers’ ability to deliver finished lots to us counties and cities in which we build homes have at times declared moratoriums on the issuance of building permits and imposed other restrictions in the areas in which sewage treatment facilities and other public facilities do not reach minimum standards in addition our homebuilding operations are regulated in certain areas by restrictive zoning and density requirements that limit the number of homes that can be built within the boundaries of a particular area to date restrictive zoning laws and the imposition of moratoriums have not had a material adverse effect on our construction activities 

competition and market factors 

the housing industry is highly competitive we compete with numerous homebuilders of varying size ranging from local to national in scope some of which have greater financial resources than we do we also face competition from the home resale market 

our homebuilding operations compete primarily on the basis of price location design quality service and reputation historically we have been one of the market leaders in each of the markets where we build homes 

the housing industry is cyclical and is affected by consumer confidence levels prevailing economic conditions and interest rates other factors that affect the housing industry and the demand for new homes include the availability and the cost of land labor and materials changes in consumer preferences demographic trends and the availability of mortgage finance programs see “risk factors” in item 1a of this form 10k for additional information regarding these risks 

we are dependent upon building material suppliers for a continuous flow of raw materials whenever possible we utilize standard products available from multiple sources in the past such raw materials have been generally available to us in adequate supply 

mortgage banking 

we provide a number of mortgage related services to our homebuilding customers through our mortgage banking operations our mortgage banking operations also include separate subsidiaries that broker title insurance and perform title searches in connection with mortgage loan closings for which they receive commissions and fees because nvrm originates mortgage loans almost exclusively for our homebuilding customers nvrm is dependent on our homebuilding segment in 2020 nvrm closed approximately 16700 loans with an aggregate principal amount of approximately 53 billion as compared to approximately 16500 loans with an aggregate principal amount of approximately 52 billion in 2019 

nvrm sells all of the mortgage loans it closes to investors in the secondary markets on a servicing released basis typically within 30 days from the loan closing nvrm is an approved sellerservicer for fannie mae “fnma” and freddie mac fhlmc mortgage loans and an approved sellerissuer of ginnie mae “gnma” department of veterans affairs “va” and federal housing administration “fha” mortgage loans 

regulation 

nvrm is subject to the rules and regulations of fnma gnma fhlmc va and fha these rules and regulations restrict certain activities of nvrm nvrm is currently eligible and expects to remain eligible to participate in such programs in addition nvrm is subject to regulation at the state and federal level including regulations issued by the consumer financial protection bureau the “cfpb” with respect to specific origination selling and servicing practices 

competition and market factors 

nvrm’s main competition comes from national regional and local mortgage bankers mortgage brokers credit unions and banks in each of these markets nvrm competes primarily on the basis of customer service variety of products offered interest rates offered prices of ancillary services and relative financing availability and costs 

pipeline 

nvrm’s mortgage loans in process that had not closed had an aggregate principal balance of approximately 34 billion as of december 31 2020 compared to approximately 22 billion as of december 31 2019 nvrm’s cancellation rate was approximately 40 36 and 32 in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively we can provide no assurance that our historical loan cancellation rates are indicative of the actual loan cancellation rate that may occur in future periods see “risk factors” in item 1a in this form 10k for additional information about factors that could increase our cancellation rate 

human capital 

as of december 31 2020 we had approximately 6100 full time employees of whom approximately 5100 worked in our homebuilding operations and approximately 1000 worked in our mortgage banking operations compared to december 31 2019 when we had approximately 5700 full time employees of whom approximately 4800 worked in our homebuilding operations and approximately 900 worked in our mortgage banking operations none of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements 

our employees are our most important asset we are committed to hiring and developing an inclusive workplace with a strong diversity of backgrounds and perspectives all of our employees must adhere to our code of ethics and standards of business conduct that sets standards for appropriate behavior in the workplace our compensation philosophy has been consistent for over 20 years and is designed to motivate and retain highly qualified and experienced employees 

we provide tools for the advancement of our employees by offering training and development opportunities that align with each employee’s responsibilities and career path we strive to promote employees from within our workforce as we believe this provides both longterm success and continuity to our operations and growth for our employees our focus is demonstrated by the tenure of our executives and our regional and division leaders 

during the past year despite the covid19 pandemic we hired additional employees to meet the strong housing demand and generally increased our employees’ compensation and benefits packages to protect our employees and homebuyers during the pandemic we implemented safety protocols such as social distancing on job sites doing virtual house tours working remotely and 

other health and safety standards as required by federal state and local government agencies we believe our employees adapted and successfully managed the business during the pandemic

 item 1a risk factors 

our business is affected by the risks generally incident to the residential construction business including but not limited to 

• actual and expected direction of interest rates which affect the availability of mortgage financing for potential purchasers of homes 

• the availability of adequate land in desirable locations on favorable terms 

• employment levels consumer confidence and spending and unexpected changes in customer preferences and 

• changes in the national economy and in the local economies of the markets in which we operate 

all of these risks are discussed in detail below 

business and industry risks 

an economic downturn or decline in economic conditions could adversely affect our business and our results of operations 

demand for new homes is sensitive to economic changes driven by conditions such as employment levels job growth consumer confidence inflation and interest rates if the housing industry suffers a downturn our sales may decline which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

interest rate movements inflation and other economic factors can negatively impact our business 

high rates of inflation generally affect the homebuilding industry adversely because of their adverse impact on interest rates high interest rates not only increase the cost of borrowed funds to homebuilders but also have a significant adverse effect on housing demand and on the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective purchasers we are also subject to potential volatility in the price of commodities that impact costs of materials used in our homebuilding business increases in prevailing interest rates 

could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

our financial results also are affected by the risks generally incident to our mortgage banking business including interest rate levels the impact of government regulation on mortgage loan originations and servicing and the need to issue forward commitments to fund and sell mortgage loans our homebuilding customers account for almost all of our mortgage banking business the volume of our continuing homebuilding operations therefore affects our mortgage banking business 

our mortgage banking business also is affected by interest rate fluctuations we also may experience marketing losses resulting from daily increases in interest rates to the extent we are unable to match interest rates and amounts on loans we have committed to originate with forward commitments from third parties to purchase such loans increases in interest rates may have a material adverse effect on our mortgage banking revenue profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

our operations may also be adversely affected by other economic factors within our markets such as negative changes in employment levels job growth wage growth consumer confidence and household formation and availability of mortgage financing one or all of which could result in reduced demand or price depression from current levels such negative trends could have a material adverse effect on homebuilding operations 

these factors and thus the homebuilding and mortgage banking businesses have at times in the past been cyclical in nature any downturn in the national economy or the local economies of the markets in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations in particular during 2020 approximately 18 and 7 of our home settlements occurred in the washington dc and baltimore md metropolitan areas respectively which accounted for approximately 24 and 10 respectively of our 2020 homebuilding revenues thus we are dependent to a significant extent on the economy and demand for housing in those areas 

because almost all of our customers require mortgage financing the availability of suitable mortgage financing could impair the affordability of our homes lower demand for our products and limit our ability to fully deliver our backlog 

our business and earnings depend on the ability of our potential customers to obtain mortgages for the purchase of our homes in addition many of our potential customers must sell their existing homes in order to buy a home from us the tightening of credit standards and the availability of suitable mortgage financing could prevent customers from buying our homes and could prevent buyers of our customers’ homes from obtaining mortgages they need to complete that purchase either of which could result in potential customers’ inability to buy a home from us if potential customers or the buyers of our customers’ current homes are not able to obtain suitable financing the result could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

if our ability to sell mortgages to investors is impaired we may be required to fund these commitments ourselves or we may not be able to originate loans at all 

our mortgage banking business sells all of the loans it originates into the secondary market usually within 30 days from the date of closing and has up to 150 million available under a repurchase agreement to fund mortgage closings see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – liquidity and capital resources” in item 7 of this form 10k for more information about the repurchase agreement in the event that disruptions to the secondary markets tighten or eliminate the available liquidity within the secondary markets for mortgage loans or the underwriting requirements by our secondary market investors continue to become more stringent our ability to sell future mortgages could decline and we could be required among other things to fund our commitments to our buyers with our own financial resources which is limited or require our home buyers to find another source of financing the result of such secondary market disruption could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

if the market value of our inventory or controlled lot position declines our profit could decrease and we may incur losses 

inventory risk can be substantial for homebuilders the market value of building lots and housing inventories can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing market conditions in addition inventory carrying costs can be significant and can result in losses in a poorly performing community or market we must continuously seek and make acquisitions of lots for expansion into new markets as well as for replacement and expansion within our current markets which we generally accomplish by entering into lpas and paying forfeitable deposits under the lpas to developers for the contractual right to acquire the lots in the event of adverse changes in economic market or community conditions we may cease further building activities in certain communities or restructure existing lpas resulting in forfeiture of some or all of any remaining land contract deposit paid to the developer we may also have significant impairments of land under development the forfeiture of land contract deposits or inventory impairments may result in a loss that could have a material adverse effect on our profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

we face competition in our homebuilding and mortgage banking operations 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive we compete with numerous homebuilders of varying size ranging from local to national in scope some of whom have greater financial resources than we do we face competition 

• for suitable and desirable lots at acceptable prices 

• from selling incentives offered by competing builders within and across developments and 

• from the existing home resale market 

our homebuilding operations compete primarily on the basis of price location design quality service and reputation 

the mortgage banking industry is also competitive our main competition comes from national regional and local mortgage bankers credit unions banks and mortgage brokers in each of these markets our mortgage banking operations compete primarily on the basis of customer service variety of products offered interest rates offered prices of ancillary services and relative financing availability and costs 

we might not be able to continue to compete successfully in our homebuilding or mortgage banking operations an inability to effectively compete may have an adverse impact on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

our inability to secure and control an adequate inventory of lots could adversely impact our operations 

the results of our homebuilding operations depend upon our continuing ability to control an adequate number of homebuilding lots in desirable locations there can be no assurance that an adequate supply of building lots will continue to be available to us on terms similar to those available in the past or that we will not be required to devote a greater amount of capital to controlling building lots than we have historically an insufficient supply of building lots in one or more of our markets an inability of our developers to deliver finished lots in a timely fashion due to their inability to secure financing to fund development activities or for other reasons or our inability to purchase or finance building lots on reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

a shortage of building materials or labor or increases in materials or labor costs may adversely impact our operations 

the homebuilding business has from time to time experienced building material and labor shortages including fluctuating lumber prices and supply in addition strong construction market conditions could restrict the labor force available to our subcontractors and us in one or more of our markets significant increases in costs resulting from these shortages or delays in construction of homes could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

we rely on subcontractors to construct our homes the failure of our subcontractors to properly construct our homes may be costly 

we engage subcontractors to perform the actual construction of our homes despite our quality control efforts we may discover that our subcontractors have engaged in improper construction practices the occurrence of such events could require us to repair the homes in accordance with our standards and as required by law the cost of satisfying our legal obligations in these instances may be significant and we may be unable to recover the cost of repair from subcontractors suppliers and insurers 

product liability litigation and warranty claims may adversely impact our operations 

construction defect and home warranty claims are common and can represent a substantial risk for the homebuilding industry the cost of insuring against construction defect and product liability claims as well as the claims themselves can be high in addition insurance companies limit coverage offered to protect against these claims further restrictions on coverage availability or significant increases in premium costs or claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

we are subject to litigation proceedings that could harm our business if an unfavorable ruling were to occur 

from time to time we are involved in litigation and other legal proceedings relating to claims arising from our operations in the normal course of business as described in but not limited to item 3 “legal proceedings” of this form 10k we are currently subject to certain legal proceedings litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings may occur these or other litigation or legal proceedings could materially affect our ability to conduct our business in the manner that we expect or otherwise adversely affect us should an unfavorable ruling occur 

if the underwriting quality of our mortgage originations is found to be deficient our profit could decrease and we may incur losses 

we originate several different loan products to our customers to finance the purchase of their home we sell all of the loans we originate into the secondary mortgage market generally within 30 days from the date of closing all of the loans that we originate are underwritten to the standards and specifications of the ultimate investor insofar as we underwrite our originated loans to those standards we bear no increased concentration of credit risk from the issuance of loans except in certain limited instances where 

repurchases or early payment default occur in the event that a substantial number of the loans that we have originated fall into default and the investors to whom we sold the loans determine that we did not underwrite the loans in accordance with their requirements we could be required to repurchase the loans from the investor or indemnify the investor for any losses incurred any resulting losses could have a material adverse effect on our profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

we may be subject to claims on mortgage loans sold to third parties 

our mortgage banking operations may be responsible for losses associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to investors in the event of errors or omissions relating to certain representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements including representations as to underwriting standards the type of collateral the existence of private mortgage insurance and the validity of certain borrower representations in connection with the loan the resolution of claims related to alleged breaches of these representations and warranties and repurchase claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition cash flows and results of operations and could result in losses that exceed existing estimates and accruals because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating these matters there can be no assurance that any amounts reserved will be adequate or that any potential inadequacies will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

the loss of key personnel could adversely impact our business 

we rely on our key personnel to effectively operate and manage our business specifically our future success depends heavily on the performance of our senior management team our business may be adversely affected if we are unable to retain key personnel or attract qualified personnel to manage our business 

our failure to maintain the security of our electronic and other confidential information could expose us to liability and materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

privacy security and compliance concerns have continued to increase as technology has evolved as part of our normal business activities we collect and store certain confidential information including personal information of homebuyersborrowers and information about employees vendors and suppliers this information is entitled to protection under a number of federal and state laws we may share some of this information with vendors who assist us with certain aspects of our business particularly our mortgage and title businesses we have implemented systems and processes intended to secure our information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive confidential and personal data including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies additionally we have continued to elevate our monitoring capabilities to enhance early detection and rapid response to potential security anomalies we also require employees to complete training sessions regarding matters such as cybersecurity threats and data protection on a regular basis these security measures may not be sufficient for all possible occurrences and may be vulnerable to hacking employee error malfeasance system error faulty password management or other irregularities further development and maintenance of these measures are costly and require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become increasingly sophisticated our failure to maintain the security of the data we are required to protect including via the penetration of our network security and the misappropriation of confidential and personal information could result in business disruption damage to our reputation financial obligations to third parties fines penalties regulatory proceedings and private litigation with potentially large costs and also in deterioration in customers’ confidence in us and other competitive disadvantages and thus could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

volatility in the credit and capital markets may impact our ability to access necessary financing 

if we require working capital greater than that provided by our operations and our credit facility we may be required to seek to increase the amount available under the facility or seek alternative financing which might not be available on terms that are favorable or acceptable if we are required to seek financing to fund our working capital requirements volatility in credit or capital markets may restrict our flexibility to access financing if we are at any time unsuccessful in obtaining sufficient capital to fund our planned homebuilding expenditures we may experience a substantial delay in the completion of homes then under construction or we may be unable to control or purchase finished building lots any delay could result in cost increases and could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

our mortgage banking operations depend in part on the availability cost and other terms of mortgage financing facilities and may be adversely affected by any shortage or increased cost of such financing additional or replacement financing might not be available on terms that are favorable or acceptable our mortgage banking operations are also dependent upon the securitization market for mortgagebacked securities and could be materially adversely affected by any fluctuation or downturn in such market 

our current indebtedness may impact our future operations 

as of december 31 2020 we had 15 billion in senior notes outstanding our existing indebtedness contains restrictive covenants and any future indebtedness may also contain such covenants these covenants include or could include restrictions on our ability to create incur assume or guarantee secured debt enter into sale and leaseback transactions and conditions related to mergers andor the sale of assets substantial losses by us or other action or inaction by us or our subsidiaries could result in the violation of 

one or more of these covenants which could result in decreased liquidity or a default on our current or future indebtedness thereby having a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

regulatory risk 

government regulations and environmental matters could negatively affect our operations 

we are subject to various local state and federal statutes ordinances rules and regulations concerning zoning building design construction and similar matters including local regulations that impose restrictive zoning and density requirements in order to limit the number of homes that can eventually be built within the boundaries of a particular area these regulations may further increase the cost to produce and market our products in addition we have from time to time been subject to and may also be subject in the future to periodic delays in our homebuilding projects due to building moratoriums in the areas in which we operate or delays in receiving the necessary governmental approvals changes in regulations that restrict homebuilding activities in one or more of our principal markets could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

in addition new housing developments are often subject to various assessments or impact fees for schools parks streets highways and other public improvements the cost of these assessments is subject to substantial change and could cause increases in the construction cost of our homes which in turn could reduce our profitability 

we are also subject to a variety of local state and federal statutes ordinances rules and regulations concerning the protection of health and the environment we are subject to a variety of environmental conditions that can affect our business and our homebuilding projects the particular environmental laws that apply to any given homebuilding site vary greatly according to the location and environmental condition of the site and the present and former uses of the site and adjoining properties environmental laws and conditions may result in delays cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs or prohibit or severely restrict homebuilding activity in certain environmentally sensitive regions or areas thereby adversely affecting our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

increased regulation of the mortgage industry could harm our future sales and earnings 

the mortgage industry remains under intense scrutiny and continues to face increasing regulation at the federal state and local level potential changes to federal laws and regulations could have the effect of limiting the activities of fnma and fhlmc the entities that provide liquidity to the secondary mortgage market which could lead to increases in mortgage interest rates tighter underwriting requirements and fee restrictions and the increasingly complex regulatory environment may negatively impact our mortgage loan origination business in the form of lower demand decreased revenue and increased operating costs 

we are an approved sellerservicer of fnma and fhlmc mortgage loans and an approved sellerissuer of gnma va and fha mortgage loans and are subject to all of those agencies’ rules and regulations any significant impairment of our eligibility to sellservice these loans could have a material adverse impact on our mortgage operations in addition we are subject to regulation at the state and federal level with respect to specific origination selling and servicing practices including the real estate settlement and protection act adverse changes in governmental regulation may have a negative impact on our mortgage loan origination business 

risks related to the covid19 pandemic and other external risks 

health epidemics including the recent covid19 pandemic have had and could in the future have an adverse impact on our business and operations and the markets states and local communities in which we operate 

our business and operations could be adversely affected by health epidemics including the recent covid19 pandemic impacting the markets states and local communities in which we operate the covid19 pandemic has been declared a national emergency efforts to contain the virus have led to significant disruptions to commerce increased unemployment lower consumer confidence and consumer demand for goods and services general uncertainty persists regarding the nearterm and longterm impact of the covid19 virus on the domestic and international economy and on public health these developments and other consequences of the outbreak could materially and adversely affect our operations profitability and cash flows 

the duration severity and scope of the covid19 outbreak is highly uncertain the covid19 pandemic has adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our business to date our primary focus as we face this challenge has been to do everything we can to ensure the safety and wellbeing of our employees customers and trade partners 

state and local governments in every market in which we operate have instituted social distancing and other restrictions which have resulted in significant changes to the way we conduct our homebuilding and mortgage banking businesses we are operating in accordance with the guidelines issued by the centers for disease control and prevention as well as state and local guidelines in all of our markets 

the ultimate impact of the covid19 pandemic or a similar health epidemic is highly uncertain and subject to change there is uncertainty regarding governmental actions that may occur and the effects of economic relief efforts on the us economy either of which could be potential disruptors to our business over the long term these disruptions related to covid19 could lower demand for our products impair our ability to sell andor build homes in our normal manner increase our losses on contract land deposits and negatively impact our lending and secondary mortgage market activities 

the full extent to which the covid19 pandemic will affect our operations cannot be predicted at this time including but not limited to the duration and severity of the outbreak governmental reactions and policies the impact of such on our employees customers and trade partners and the length of time required for normal economic and operating conditions to resume there is no assurance that we will not face shutdowns similar to those we experienced in pennsylvania and new york in april and may of 2020 in those or other markets in which we operate in future periods while the spread of covid19 may eventually be mitigated there is no guarantee that a future outbreak of this or any other widespread epidemics will not occur or that the us economy will recover either of which could seriously harm our business 

weatherrelated and other events beyond our control may adversely impact our operations 

extreme weather or other events such as significant snowfalls hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes forest fires floods terrorist attacks or war may affect our markets our operations and our profitability these events may impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or subcontractors and our housing inventories causing us material increases in costs or delays in construction of homes which could have a material adverse effect upon our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

our continued success is dependent on positive perceptions of us and our brands which if eroded could adversely affect our business and our relationships with our customers 

we believe that one of the reasons our customers buy from us our employees choose nvr as a place of employment and our vendors choose to do business with us is the reputation we have built over many years to be successful in the future we must continue to preserve our reputation reputational value is based in large part on perceptions and broad access to social media makes it easy for anyone to provide public feedback that can influence perceptions of the brands under which we do business it may be difficult to control negative publicity regardless of whether it is accurate while reputations may take decades to build negative incidents can quickly erode trust and confidence could damage our reputation reduce the demand for our homes or negatively impact the morale and performance of our employees all of which could adversely affect our business

overview 

business environment and the impact of covid19 

the pandemic caused by the novel strain of coronavirus covid19 has had a significant impact on all facets of our business our primary focus as we face this challenge is to do everything we can to ensure the safety and wellbeing of our employees customers and trade partners residential construction has been deemed an essential business in each of our markets since the beginning of the pandemic except pennsylvania and new york where we faced closures into may 2020 in each of our markets we continue to operate in accordance with the guidelines issued by the centers for disease control and prevention as well as state and local guidelines which has resulted in significant changes to the way we conduct business 

we experienced elevated sales cancellations and decreased new orders during march and april however the demand for new homes began to strengthen in may and remained strong through december despite high unemployment rates attributable to the covid19 pandemic demand has increased primarily as a result of historically low mortgage interest rates coupled with low resale inventory levels 

from march through may there were significant disruptions in the mortgage market as investors tightened their credit standards or exited the market which resulted in significantly lower values for mortgage servicing rights and fewer customers able to qualify for a mortgage during the second half of 2020 the mortgage market stabilized as mortgage demand increased 

although current demand for new homes is strong there is uncertainty regarding the extent and timing of disruption to our business that may result from covid19 and related governmental actions there is also uncertainty as to the effects of the pandemic and related economic relief efforts on the us economy unemployment consumer confidence demand for our homes and the mortgage market including lending standards and secondary mortgage markets we are unable to predict the extent to which this will impact our operational and financial performance including the impact of future developments such as the duration and spread of covid19 corresponding governmental actions and the impact of such on our employees customers and trade partners 

we expect to continue to face gross profit margin pressure which will be impacted by our ability to manage land and construction costs as well as balancing sales pace and pricing we also expect to face pressure on mortgage banking profit due to the competitive pricing pressures in the mortgage market we believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities that may arise from future economic and homebuilding market volatility due to the strength of our balance sheet 

business 

our primary business is the construction and sale of singlefamily detached homes townhomes and condominium buildings all of which are primarily constructed on a presold basis to fully serve customers of our homebuilding operations we also operate a mortgage banking and title services business we primarily conduct our operations in mature markets additionally we generally grow our business through market share gains in our existing markets and by expanding into markets contiguous to our current active markets our four homebuilding reportable segments consist of the following regions   



our lot acquisition strategy is predicated upon avoiding the financial risks associated with direct land ownership and development we generally do not engage in land development see discussion below of our land development activities instead we typically acquire finished lots from various third party land developers pursuant to lpas these lpas require deposits typically ranging up to 10 of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots in the form of cash or letters of credit that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the lpa this strategy has allowed us to maximize inventory turnover which we believe enables us to minimize market risk and to operate with less capital thereby enhancing rates of return on equity and total capital 

in addition to constructing homes primarily on a presold basis and utilizing what we believe is a conservative lot acquisition strategy we focus on obtaining and maintaining a leading market position in each market we serve this strategy allows us to gain valuable efficiencies and competitive advantages in our markets which we believe contributes to minimizing the adverse effects of 

regional economic cycles and provides growth opportunities within these markets our continued success is contingent upon our ability to control an adequate supply of finished lots on which to build 

in limited specific strategic circumstances we deviate from our historical lot acquisition strategy and engage in joint venture arrangements with land developers or directly acquire raw ground already zoned for its intended use for development once we acquire control of raw ground we determine whether to sell the raw parcel to a developer and enter into an lpa with the developer to purchase the finished lots or to hire a developer to develop the land on our behalf while joint venture arrangements and direct land development activity are not our preferred method of acquiring finished building lots we may enter into additional transactions in the future on a limited basis where there exists a compelling strategic or prudent financial reason to do so we expect however to continue to acquire substantially all of our finished lot inventory using lpas with forfeitable deposits 

as of december 31 2020 we controlled lots as described below 

lot purchase agreements lpas 

we controlled approximately 103000 lots under lpas with third parties through deposits in cash and letters of credit totaling approximately 438500 and 8100 respectively included in the number of controlled lots are approximately 7700 lots for which we have recorded a contract land deposit impairment reserve of approximately 52200 as of december 31 2020 

joint venture limited liability corporations “jvs” 

we had an aggregate investment totaling approximately 23600 in four jvs expected to produce approximately 5200 lots of the lots to be produced by the jvs approximately 2200 lots were controlled by us and approximately 3000 lots were either under contract with unrelated parties or currently not under contract 

land under development 

we directly owned three separate raw land parcels zoned for their intended use with a current cost basis including development costs of approximately 62800 that we intend to develop into approximately 500 finished lots we had additional funding commitments of approximately 5100 under a joint development agreement related to one parcel a portion of which we expect will be offset by development credits of approximately 2600 

see notes 3 4 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information regarding lpas jvs and land under development respectively 

raw land purchase agreements 

in addition to the lots we currently control as discussed above we have certain properties under contract with land owners that are expected to yield approximately 6100 lots some of these properties may require rezoning or other approvals to achieve the expected yield these properties are controlled with cash deposits and letters of credit totaling approximately 1300 and 100 respectively as of december 31 2020 of which approximately 1000 is refundable if we do not perform under the contract we generally expect to assign the raw land contracts to a land developer and simultaneously enter into an lpa with the assignee if the project is determined to be feasible 

key financial results 

our consolidated revenues for the year ended december 31 2020 totaled 7536923 an increase of 2 from 7388664 in 2019 our net income for 2020 was 901248 or 23011 per diluted share increases of 3 and 4 compared to 2019 net income and diluted earnings per share respectively our homebuilding gross profit margin percentage was 190 in both 2020 and 2019 new orders net of cancellations “new orders” during 2020 were 23082 an increase of 18 from 2019 while our average new order sales price increased 3 to 3801 in 2020 our backlog of homes sold but not yet settled with the customer as of december 31 2020 increased on a unit basis by 40 to 11549 units and increased on a dollar basis by 46 to 4575899 when compared to december 31 2019 income before tax from our mortgage banking segment totaled 140073 in 2020 an increase of 37 when compared to 101916 in 2019 due primarily to an increase in secondary marketing gains on sales of loans 

homebuilding operations 

the following table summarizes the results of our consolidated homebuilding operations and certain operating activity for each of the last three years 



consolidated homebuilding 

homebuilding revenues increased 2 in 2020 compared to 2019 as a result of a 1 increase in the average settlement price coupled with a slight increase in the number of units settled year over year settlements in 2020 were negatively impacted by the covid19 pandemic primarily during the first and second quarters of 2020 gross profit margin percentage in 2020 remained flat year over year at 190    

the number of new orders and the average sales price of new orders increased 18 and 3 respectively in 2020 when compared to 2019 the increase in new orders was favorably impacted by increased demand in the second half of 2020 due to favorable market conditions driven by historically low mortgage interest rates coupled with low resale home inventory levels new orders were higher in each of our reportable segments in both the third and fourth quarters of 2020 compared to the same periods of 2019 due to these favorable market conditions the increase in the average sales price of new orders was primarily attributable to improved pricing power in each of our markets 

selling general and administrative sga expenses in 2020 decreased by 4 compared to 2019 and as a percentage of revenue decreased to 59 in 2020 from 62 in 2019 sga expenses were lower primarily due to an approximate 26800 decrease in equitybased compensation expense due primarily to the stock options granted in 2014 under the 2014 equity incentive plan becoming fully vested in 2019 offset partially by an increase in personnel costs attributable to an increase of approximately 11200 in management incentive expense based on an increase in eligible employees and improved results 

our backlog represents homes sold but not yet settled with our customers backlog units and dollars were 11549 units and 4575899 respectively as of december 31 2020 compared to 8233 units and 3130282 respectively as of december 31 2019 the increases in backlog units and dollars is attributable to the increases in new orders and the average sales price of new orders as discussed above coupled with a lower backlog turnover rate year over year 

in addition to the impact of the covid19 pandemic our backlog may be impacted by customer cancellations for various reasons that are beyond our control such as failure to obtain mortgage financing inability to sell an existing home job loss or a variety of other reasons in any period a portion of the cancellations that we experience are related to new orders that occurred during the same period and a portion are related to new orders that occurred in prior periods and therefore appeared in the beginning backlog for the current period additionally a substantial majority of our cancellations occur prior to starting construction on a home expressed as the total of all cancellations during the period as a percentage of gross new orders during the period our cancellation rate was 149 146 and 145 in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively additionally approximately 6 in both 2020 and 2019 and 5 in 2018 of a reporting quarter’s opening backlog cancelled during the quarter we can provide no assurance that our historical cancellation rates are indicative of the actual cancellation rate that may occur in future years other than those units that are cancelled and subject to potential construction delays resulting from covid19 related restrictions we expect to settle substantially all of our december 31 2020 backlog during 2021 see “risk factors” in item 1a of this form 10k 

the backlog turnover rate is impacted by various factors including but not limited to changes in new order activity internal production capacity external subcontractor capacity and other external factors over which we do not exercise control such as the impact of government orders to cease or limit construction activities as a result of covid19 

reportable homebuilding segments 

homebuilding segment profit includes all revenues and income generated from the sale of homes less the cost of homes sold sga expenses and a corporate capital allocation charge determined by corporate management the corporate capital allocation charge eliminates in consolidation and is based on the segment’s average net assets employed the corporate capital allocation charged to the operating segment allows the chief operating decision maker to determine whether the operating segment is providing the desired rate of return after covering our cost of capital 

we record impairment charges on contract land deposits when we determine that it is probable that recovery of the deposit is impaired for segment reporting purposes impairments on contract land deposits are generally charged to the operating segment upon the termination of an lpa with the developer or the restructuring of an lpa resulting in the forfeiture of the deposit we evaluate our entire net contract land deposit portfolio for impairment each quarter for presentation purposes below the contract land deposit reserve at december 31 2020 and 2019 has been allocated to the reportable segments for the respective years to show contract land deposits on a net basis the net contract land deposit balances below also include approximately 8100 and 5500 at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively of letters of credit issued as deposits in lieu of cash 

the following tables summarize certain homebuilding operating activity by reportable segment for each of the last three years 

selected segment financial data 









segment operating activity 







  operating data 





homebuilding inventory 





  

1 total segment inventory differs from consolidated inventory due to certain consolidation adjustments necessary to convert the reportable segments’ results which are predominantly maintained on a cash basis to a full accrual basis for external financial statement presentation purposes these consolidation adjustments are not allocated to our operating segments 

lots controlled and land deposits 







mid atlantic 

the mid atlantic segment had an approximate 40700 or 9 decrease in segment profit in 2020 compared to 2019 driven by a decrease in segment revenues of approximately 233000 or 6 year over year segment revenues decreased due to a 10 decrease in the number of units settled offset partially by a 5 increase in the average settlement price year over year the decrease in the number of units settled was impacted by a 13 lower backlog unit balance entering 2020 compared to the backlog unit balance entering 2019 coupled with a lower backlog turnover rate year over year the increase in the average settlement price was primarily attributable to a 4 higher average sales price of units in backlog entering 2020 compared to backlog entering 2019 the mid atlantic segment’s gross profit margin percentage remained flat at 188 in both 2020 and 2019 

segment new orders and the average sales price of new orders increased 5 and 7 respectively in 2020 compared to 2019 new orders increased despite a 14 decrease in the average number of active communities year over year due to higher absorption rates attributable to favorable market conditions in the second half of 2020 driven primarily by historically low mortgage interest rates and low resale inventory levels the increase in the average sales price of new orders was primarily attributable to improved pricing power in the segment   

north east 

the north east segment had an approximate 1100 or 2 decrease in segment profit in 2020 compared to 2019 despite an increase in segment revenues of approximately 24000 or 5 year over year the increase in segment revenues was attributable to a 4 increase in the number of units settled and a 1 increase in the average settlement price year over year the increase in the number of units settled was attributable to a 4 higher backlog unit balance entering 2020 compared to the backlog unit balance entering 2019 coupled with a 27 increase in new orders in the first nine months of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 the segment’s gross profit margin percentage decreased to 190 in 2020 from 195 in 2019 due primarily to increases in lumber and certain other commodity prices year over year 

segment new orders and the average sales price of new orders increased 29 and 7 respectively in 2020 compared to 2019 new orders increased due to a 19 increase in the average number of active communities year over year and favorable market conditions in the second half of 2020 driven primarily by historically low mortgage interest rates and low resale inventory levels the average sales price of new orders was favorably impacted by the previously mentioned favorable market conditions which provided us some pricing power as well as to a relative market shift in new orders to higher priced communities within certain markets in the segment 

mid east 

the mid east segment had an approximate 4800 or 3 decrease in segment profit in 2020 compared to 2019 despite an increase in segment revenues of approximately 23500 or 2 year over year segment revenues increased primarily due to a 2 increase in the number of units settled year over year the increase in units settled was largely attributable to a 24 increase in settlements in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 as settlements in the first half of 2020 were delayed in our western pennsylvania and new york markets due to the state and local governments in those markets issuing various orders that prohibited residential construction from the end of march through april 2020 as a result of the covid19 pandemic the segment’s gross profit margin percentage decreased to 185 in 2020 from 190 in 2019 due to increases in lumber and certain other commodity prices year over year 

segment new orders and the average sales price of new orders increased 25 and 2 respectively in 2020 compared to 2019 new orders increased primarily due to higher absorption rates attributable to favorable market conditions driven primarily by historically low mortgage interest rates and low resale inventory levels 

south east 

the south east segment had an approximate 49900 or 32 increase in segment profit in 2020 compared to 2019 the increase in segment profit was primarily driven by an increase in segment revenues of approximately 293600 or 23 coupled with improved gross profit margins year over year the increase in revenues was attributable to a 21 increase in the number of units settled and a 1 increase in the average settlement price year over year the number of units settled were favorably impacted by a 20 higher backlog unit balance entering 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 coupled with a 21 increase in new orders in the first six months of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 the segment’s gross profit margin percentage increased to 205 in 2020 from 200 in 2019 due to a relative shift in settlements to higher margin communities 

segment new orders and the average sales price of new orders increased 33 and 2 respectively in 2020 compared to 2019 new orders increased due to to a 15 increase in the average number of active communities year over year coupled with higher absorption rates attributable to favorable market conditions in the second half of 2020 driven primarily by historically low mortgage interest rates and low resale inventory levels 

homebuilding segment reconciliations to consolidated homebuilding operations 

in addition to the corporate capital allocation and contract land deposit impairments discussed above the other reconciling items between homebuilding segment profit and homebuilding consolidated profit before tax include unallocated corporate overhead which includes all management incentive compensation equitybased compensation expense consolidation adjustments and external corporate interest expense our overhead functions such as accounting treasury and human resources are centrally performed and the costs are not allocated to our operating segments consolidation adjustments consist of such items to convert the reportable segments’ results which are predominantly maintained on a cash basis to a full accrual basis for external financial statement presentation purposes and are not allocated to our operating segments external corporate interest expense is primarily comprised of interest charges on our 395 senior notes due 2022 and 300 senior notes due 2030 and is not charged to the operating segments because the charges are included in the corporate capital allocation discussed above 



  



  

1 this item represents changes to the contract land deposit impairment reserve which are not allocated to the reportable segments see further discussion of contract land deposit impairment charges in note 3 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

2 the decrease in equitybased compensation expense in 2020 was primarily attributable to stock options issued in 2014 under the 2014 equity incentive plan becoming fully vested in 2019 in addition there were higher stock option forfeitures in 2020 compared to 2019 

3 the increase in 2020 relates primarily to the significant increase in lumber prices during the second half of 2020 our reportable segments results include intercompany profits of our production facilities which were negatively impacted by the increase in lumber costs the increase in lumber costs related to homes not yet settled is eliminated through the consolidation adjustment as these homes currently in inventory are settled in subsequent quarters our consolidated homebuilding margins will be negatively impacted by the higher lumber costs 

4 this item represents the elimination of the corporate capital allocation charge included in the respective homebuilding reportable segments the corporate capital allocation charge is based on the segment’s monthly average asset balance and is as follows for the years presented 



mortgage banking segment 

we conduct our mortgage banking activity through nvrm a wholly owned subsidiary nvrm focuses almost exclusively on serving the homebuilding segment customer base the following table summarizes the results of our mortgage banking operations and certain statistical data for each of the last three years 



loan closing volume in 2020 increased by approximately 153100 or 3 from 2019 the increase was primarily attributable to a 1 increase in the number of loans closed year over year due primarily to the aforementioned increase in the homebuilding segment’s number of settlements in 2020 as compared to 2019 and a 2 increase in the average loan amount in 2020 compared to 2019 

segment profit in 2020 increased by approximately 38000 or 36 from 2019 the increase in segment profit was primarily attributable to an increase in mortgage banking fees mortgage banking fees increased by approximately 40200 or 24 resulting from the aforementioned increase in loan closing volume and an increase in secondary marketing gains on sales of loans 

mortgage banking – other 

we sell all of the loans we originate into the secondary mortgage market insofar as we underwrite our originated loans to the standards and specifications of the ultimate investor we have no further financial obligations from the issuance of loans except in certain limited instances where repurchases or early payment default occur those underwriting standards are typically equal to or more stringent than the underwriting standards required by fnma gnma fhlmc va and fha because we sell all of our loans and do not service them there is often a substantial delay between the time that a loan goes into default and the time that the investor 

requests us to reimburse them for losses incurred because of the default we believe that all of the loans that we originate are underwritten to the standards and specifications of the ultimate investor to whom we sell our originated loans we employ a quality control department to ensure that our underwriting controls are effective and further assess the underwriting function as part of our assessment of internal controls over financial reporting 

we maintain a reserve for losses on mortgage loans originated that reflects our judgment of the present loss exposure from the loans that we have originated and sold at december 31 2020 and 2019 we had repurchase reserves of approximately 20500 and 18500 respectively 

nvrm is dependent on our homebuilding operation’s customers for business if new orders and selling prices of the homebuilding segment decline nvrm’s operations will also be adversely affected in addition nvrm’s operating results may be adversely affected in future periods due to tightening and volatility of the credit markets changes in investor funding times increased regulation of mortgage lending practices and increased competition in the mortgage market 

seasonality 

we generally have higher new order activity in the first half of the year and higher home settlements revenues and net income in the second half of the year however covid19 related restrictions negatively impacted our new order activity in march and april affecting our typical seasonal new order trend 

effective tax rate 

our consolidated effective tax rate in 2020 2019 and 2018 was 1640 1436 and 1694 respectively the higher effective tax rate in 2020 compared to 2019 was attributable primarily to the retroactive reinstatement of certain expired energy tax credits under the further consolidated appropriations act in 2019 which resulted in the recognition of a tax benefit of approximately 15100 in 2019 related to homes settled in 2018 and 2019 for the year ended december 31 2020 we recognized approximately 10200 in energy tax credits 

additionally our effective tax rates in 2020 2019 and 2018 were favorably impacted by the recognition of an income tax benefit related to excess tax benefits from stock option exercises of 92234 101466 and 77478 respectively we expect continued tax rate volatility in future years attributable to the recognition of excess tax benefits from equity plan activity and distributions from the deferred compensation plans

liquidity and capital resources 

lines of credit and notes payable 

we had a very strong liquidity position as of december 31 2020 with approximately 28 billion in cash and cash equivalents approximately 187200 in unused committed capacity under our revolving credit facility and 150000 in unused committed capacity under our revolving mortgage repurchase facility 

our homebuilding segment funds its operations from cash flows provided by operating activities a shortterm unsecured working capital revolving credit facility and capital raised in the public debt and equity markets 

senior notes 

on september 10 2012 we completed an offering for 600000 aggregate principal amount of 395 senior notes due 2022 the 2022 senior notes the 2022 senior notes were issued at a discount to yield 397 and have been reflected net of the unamortized discount in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet the 2022 senior notes mature on september 15 2022 and bear interest at 395 payable semiannually in arrears on march 15 and september 15

on september 9 and september 17 2020 we issued an additional 250000 and 50000 respectively of 300 2030 senior notes the 2030 additional notes and together with the 2030 senior notes and the 2022 senior notes the senior notes the 

2030 additional notes were issued at a premium to yield 200 and have been reflected net of the unamortized premium and unamortized debt issuance costs in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet the offering of the 2030 additional notes resulted in aggregate net proceeds of approximately 323600 including the underwriting premium less offering expenses the 2030 additional notes form a single series with the 2030 senior notes and have substantially identical terms as the 2030 senior notes 

the senior notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with any of our existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness will rank senior in right of payment to any of our future indebtedness that is by its terms expressly subordinated to the senior notes and will be effectively subordinated to any of our existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness the indenture governing the senior notes does not contain any financial covenants however it does contain among other items and subject to certain exceptions covenants that restrict our ability to create incur assume or guarantee secured debt enter into sale and leaseback transactions and conditions related to mergers andor the sale of assets we were in compliance with all covenants under the senior notes at december 31 2020

common stock repurchases 

in addition to funding growth in our homebuilding and mortgage banking operations we historically have used a substantial portion of our excess liquidity to repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock in open market and privately negotiated transactions this ongoing repurchase activity is conducted pursuant to publicly announced board authorizations and is typically executed in accordance with the safeharbor provisions of rule 10b18 promulgated under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended in addition the board resolutions authorizing us to repurchase shares of our common stock specifically prohibit us from purchasing shares from our officers directors profit sharing plan trust or employee stock ownership plan trust the repurchase program assists us in accomplishing our primary objective creating increases in shareholder value see “market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities” in item 5 of this form 10k for disclosure of amounts repurchased during the fourth quarter of 2020 for the year ended december 31 2020 we repurchased 93346 shares of our common stock at an aggregate purchase price of 371078 as of december 31 2020 we had 546062 available under board approved repurchase authorizations 

cash flows 

for the year ended december 31 2020 cash restricted cash and cash equivalents increased by 1648978 net cash provided by operating activities was 925269 due primarily to cash provided by earnings in 2020 and net proceeds of 212636 from mortgage loan activity additionally cash was provided by an increase in customer deposits attributable to the increase in our ending backlog year over year cash was primarily used to fund the increase in inventory of 362384 attributable to an increase in units under construction at december 31 2020 compared to december 31 2019 

net cash used in investing activities in 2020 was 3933 cash was used for purchases of property plant and equipment of 16119 offset partially by the receipt of capital distributions from our unconsolidated jvs totaling 11625 

net cash provided by financing activities in 2020 was 727642 due primarily to the net proceeds received from the issuance of the 2030 senior notes as discussed above and by 180866 in proceeds from stock option exercises in 2020 cash was used during the period to repurchase shares of our common stock under our ongoing common stock repurchase program as discussed above 

for the year ended december 31 2019 cash restricted cash and cash equivalents increased by 428556 net cash provided by operating activities was 866535 due primarily to cash provided by earnings in 2019 and net proceeds of 91178 from mortgage loan activity cash was primarily used to fund the increase in inventory of 94178 attributable to an increase in units under construction at december 31 2019 compared to december 31 2018 net cash used in investing activities in 2019 of 13284 was attributable primarily to cash used for purchases of property plant and equipment of 22699 offset partially by the receipt of capital distributions from our unconsolidated jvs totaling 8247 net cash used in financing activities of 424695 resulted primarily from our repurchase of 220965 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of 698417 under our ongoing common stock repurchase program as discussed above offset partially by 274028 in proceeds from stock option exercises 

at december 31 2020 and 2019 the homebuilding segment had restricted cash of 28912 and 17943 respectively restricted cash in each year was attributable to customer deposits for certain home sales 

we believe that our current cash holdings cash generated from operations and cash available under our shortterm unsecured credit agreement revolving mortgage repurchase facility and the public debt and equity markets will be sufficient to satisfy near and long term cash requirements for working capital and debt service in both our homebuilding and mortgage banking operations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

lot acquisition strategy 

we generally do not engage in land development instead we typically acquire finished building lots from various land developers under lpas that require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the agreement the deposits required under the lpas are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percentage typically ranging up to 10 of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots 

we believe that our lot acquisition strategy reduces the financial risks associated with direct land ownership and land development we may at our option choose for any reason and at any time not to perform under these lpas by delivering notice of our intent not to acquire the finished lots under contract our sole legal obligation and economic loss for failure to perform under these purchase agreements is limited to the amount of the deposit pursuant to the liquidated damage provision contained in the lpas we do not have any financial guarantees or completion obligations and we typically do not guarantee lot purchases on a specific performance basis under these lpas 

at december 31 2020 we controlled approximately 105700 lots through lpas jvs and land under development with an aggregate purchase price of approximately 10300000 these lots are controlled by making or committing to make deposits of approximately 661600 in the form of cash and letters of credit our entire risk of loss pertaining to the aggregate purchase price contractual commitment resulting from our nonperformance under the contracts is limited to 438500 in deposits paid and 8100 in letters of credit issued as of december 31 2020 plus approximately 215000 related to deposits to be paid subsequent to december 31 2020 assuming that contractual development milestones are met by the developers and we exercise our option as of december 31 2020 we had recorded an impairment valuation allowance of approximately 52200 related to certain cash deposits currently outstanding additionally as of december 31 2020 we had funding commitments totaling 3100 to one of our jvs and approximately 5100 under a joint development agreement related to our land under development a portion of which we expect will be offset by development credits of approximately 2600 

in addition we have certain properties under contract with land owners that are expected to yield approximately 6100 lots which are not included in our number of total lots controlled above some of these properties may require rezoning or other approvals to achieve the expected yield these properties are controlled with cash deposits and letters of credit of approximately 1300 and 100 respectively as of december 31 2020 of which approximately 1000 is refundable if we do not perform under the contract and the remainder is at risk of loss we generally expect to assign the raw land contracts to a land developer and simultaneously enter into an lpa with the assignee if the project is determined to be feasible please refer to note 1 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of the contract land deposits and note 3 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of our lot acquisition strategy in relation to our accounting for variable interest entities 

bonds and letters of credit 

we enter into bond or letter of credit arrangements with local municipalities government agencies or land developers to collateralize our obligations under various contracts we had approximately 40600 of contingent obligations under such agreements as of december 31 2020 inclusive of the 8100 of lot acquisition deposits in the form of letters of credit discussed above we believe we will fulfill our obligations under the related contracts and do not anticipate any material losses under these bonds or letters of credit 

mortgage commitments and forward sales 

in the normal course of business nvrm enters into contractual commitments to extend credit to our homebuyers with fixed expiration dates the commitments become effective when the borrowers “lockin” a specified interest rate within time frames established by us all mortgagors are evaluated for credit worthiness prior to the extension of the commitment market risk arises if interest rates move adversely between the time of the “lockin” of rates by the borrower and the sale date of the loan to an investor to mitigate the effect of the interest rate risk inherent in providing rate lock commitments to borrowers we enter into optional or mandatory delivery forward sale contracts to sell whole loans and mortgagebacked securities to investors the forward sale contracts lock in a range of interest rates and prices for the sale of loans similar to the specific rate lock commitments we do not engage in speculative or trading derivative activities both the rate lock commitments to borrowers and the forward sale contracts to investors are undesignated derivatives and accordingly are marked to fair value through earnings at december 31 2020 we had contractual commitments to extend credit to borrowers aggregating 617308 and open forward delivery contracts aggregating 916588 which hedge both the rate lock commitments and closed loans held for sale see note 15 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of our fair value accounting 

contractual obligations 

our fixed noncancelable obligations as of december 31 2020 were as follows 



  

1 see note 9 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the senior notes 

2 see note 13 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our finance and operating leases 

3 amount represents expected payments of forfeitable deposits with land developers under existing lpas assuming that contractual development milestones are met by the developers and we exercise our option and estimated contractual obligations for land development agreements we expect to make the majority of payments of the deposits with land developers within the next three years but due to the nature of the contractual development milestones that must be met we are unable to accurately estimate the portion of the deposit obligation that will be made within one year and that portion that will be made within one to three years 

4 due to the nature of the uncertain tax positions we are unable to make a reasonable estimate as to the period of settlement with the respective taxing authorities 

critical accounting policies 

general 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods we continually evaluate the estimates we use to prepare the consolidated financial statements and update those estimates as necessary in general our estimates are based on historical experience on information from third party professionals and other various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances actual results could differ materially from those estimates made by management 

homebuilding inventory 

the carrying value of inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market value cost of lots and completed and uncompleted housing units represent the accumulated actual cost of the units field construction supervisors’ salaries and related direct overhead expenses are included in inventory costs interest costs are not capitalized into inventory with the exception of land under development and joint venture investments as applicable see below upon settlement the cost of the unit is expensed on a specific identification basis cost of building materials is determined on a firstin firstout basis 

sold inventory is evaluated for impairment based on the contractual selling price compared to the total estimated cost to construct unsold inventory is evaluated for impairment by analyzing recent comparable sale prices within the applicable community compared to the costs incurred to date plus the expected costs to complete any calculated impairments are recorded immediately in cost of sales 

contract land deposits and land under development 

contract land deposits 

we purchase finished lots under lpas that require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the contract the deposits are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percentage of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots 

we maintain an allowance for losses on contract land deposits that reflects our judgment of the present loss exposure in the existing contract land deposit portfolio at the end of the reporting period to analyze contract land deposit impairments we conduct a loss contingency analysis each quarter in addition to considering market and economic conditions we assess contract land deposit impairments on a communitybycommunity basis pursuant to the purchase contract terms analyzing quantitative and qualitative information including as applicable current sales absorption levels recent sales’ profit margin the dollar differential between the contractual purchase price and the current market price for lots a developer’s performance a developer’s financial ability or willingness to reduce lot prices to current market prices if necessary and the contract’s default status by either us or the developer along with an analysis of the expected outcome of any such default 

our analysis is focused on whether we can sell houses at an acceptable margin and sales pace in a particular community in the current market with which we are faced because we do not own the finished lots on which we had placed a contract land deposit if the above analysis leads to a determination that we cannot sell homes at an acceptable margin and sales pace at the current contractual lot price we then determine whether we will elect to default under the contract forfeit our deposit and terminate the contract or whether we will attempt to restructure the lot purchase contract which may require us to forfeit the deposit to obtain contract concessions from a developer we also assess whether an impairment is present due to collectability issues resulting from a developer’s nonperformance because of financial or other conditions 

although we consider the allowance for losses on contract land deposits reflected on the december 31 2020 consolidated balance sheet to be adequate see note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included herein there can be no assurance that this allowance will prove to be adequate over time to cover losses due to unanticipated adverse changes in the economy or other events adversely affecting specific markets or the homebuilding industry 

land under development 

on a limited basis we directly acquire raw parcels of land already zoned for its intended use to develop into finished lots land under development includes the land acquisition costs direct improvement costs capitalized interest where applicable and real estate taxes 

land under development including the land under development held by our unconsolidated jvs and the related joint venture investments is reviewed for potential writedowns when impairment indicators are present in addition to considering market and economic conditions we assess land under development impairments on a communitybycommunity basis analyzing as applicable current sales absorption levels recent sales’ profit margin and the dollar differential between the projected fullydeveloped cost of the lots and the current market price for lots if indicators of impairment are present for a community we perform an analysis to determine if the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts and if so impairment charges are required to be recorded in an amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of such assets our determination of fair value is primarily based on discounting the estimated future cash flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams 

at december 31 2020 we had approximately 62800 in land under development in three separate communities in addition at december 31 2020 we had an aggregate investment totaling approximately 23600 in four separate jvs that controlled land under development during 2020 we recognized an impairment of approximately 1800 related to one of our jvs none of the communities classified as land under development nor any of the undeveloped land held by the jvs had any indicators of impairment at december 31 2020 as such we do not believe that any of the land under development is impaired at this time however there can be no assurance that we will not incur impairment charges in the future due to unanticipated adverse changes in the economy or other events adversely affecting specific markets or the homebuilding industry 

warrantyproduct liability accruals 

we establish warranty and product liability reserves to provide for estimated future expenses as a result of construction and product defects product recalls and litigation incidental to our homebuilding business liability estimates are determined based on our judgment considering such factors as historical experience the likely current cost of corrective action manufacturers’ and subcontractors’ participation in sharing the cost of corrective action consultations with third party experts such as engineers and discussions with our general counsel and outside counsel retained to handle specific product liability cases although we consider the warranty and product liability accrual reflected on the december 31 2020 consolidated balance sheet to be adequate see note 14 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included herein there can be no assurance that this accrual will prove to be adequate over time to cover losses due to increased costs for material and labor the inability or refusal of manufacturers or subcontractors to financially participate in corrective action unanticipated adverse legal settlements or other unanticipated changes to the assumptions used to estimate the warranty and product liability accrual 

equitybased compensation expense 

we recognize equitybased compensation expense within our income statement for all sharebased payment arrangements which include nonqualified stock options to purchase shares of nvr common stock options and restricted share units rsus compensation expense is based on the grantdate fair value of the options and rsus granted and is recognized on a straightline basis over the requisite service period for the entire award from the date of grant through the period of the last separately vesting portion of the grant options and rsus which are subject to a performance condition are treated as a separate award from the “serviceonly” options and rsus and compensation expense is recognized when it becomes probable that the stated performance target will be achieved we calculate the fair value of our options which are nonpublicly traded using the blackscholes optionpricing model the grant date fair value of the rsus is the closing price of our common stock on the day immediately preceding the date of grant the reversal of compensation expense previously recognized for grants forfeited is recorded in the period in which the forfeiture occurs 

as noted above we calculate the fair value of our options which are nonpublicly traded using the blackscholes optionpricing model while the blackscholes model is a widely accepted method to calculate the fair value of options its results are dependent on input variables two of which expected term and expected volatility are significantly dependent on management’s judgment we have concluded that our historical exercise experience is the best estimate of future exercise patterns to determine an option’s expected term to estimate expected volatility we analyze the historical volatility of our common stock over a period equal to the option’s expected term changes in management’s judgment of the expected term and the expected volatility could have a material effect on the grantdate fair value calculated and expensed within the income statement 

in addition when recognizing equitybased compensation cost related to “performance condition” option and rsu grants we are required to make a determination as to whether the performance conditions will be met prior to the completion of the actual performance period the performance metric is based on our return on capital performance during a specified three year period based on the date of option grant while we currently believe that this performance condition will be satisfied at the target level and are recognizing compensation expense related to such options and rsus accordingly our future expected activity levels could cause us to 

make a different determination resulting in a change to the compensation expense to be recognized related to performance condition option and rsu grants that would otherwise have been recognized to date 

although we believe that the compensation costs recognized in 2020 are representative of the cumulative ratable amortization of the grantdate fair value of unvested options and rsus outstanding changes to the estimated input values such as expected term and expected volatility and changes to the determination of whether performance condition grants will vest could produce widely different expense valuations and recognition 

mortgage repurchase reserve 

we originate several different loan products to our customers to finance the purchase of their home we sell all of the loans we originate into the secondary mortgage market on a servicing released basis typically within 30 days from closing all of the loans that we originate are underwritten to the standards and specifications of the ultimate investor those underwriting standards are typically equal to or more stringent than the underwriting standards required by fnma gnma fhlmc va and fha insofar as we underwrite our originated loans to those standards we bear no increased concentration of credit risk from the issuance of loans except in certain limited instances where repurchases or early payment default occur we employ a quality control department to ensure that our underwriting controls are effectively operating and further assess the underwriting function as part of our assessment of internal controls over financial reporting we maintain a reserve for losses on mortgage loans originated that reflects our judgment of the present loss exposure in the loans that we have originated and sold the reserve is calculated based on an analysis of historical experience and exposure although we consider the mortgage repurchase reserve reflected on the december 31 2020 consolidated balance sheet to be adequate see note 16 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included herein there can be no assurance that this reserve will prove to be adequate over time to cover losses due to unanticipated changes to the assumptions used to estimate the mortgage repurchase reserve

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

 dollars in thousands 

market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates our market risk arises from interest rate risk inherent in our financial instruments and debt obligations interest rate risk results from the possibility that changes in interest rates will cause unfavorable changes in net income or in the value of interest ratesensitive assets liabilities and commitments lower interest rates tend to increase demand for mortgage loans for home purchasers while higher interest rates make it more difficult for potential borrowers to purchase residential properties and to qualify for mortgage loans we have no market rate sensitive instruments held for speculative or trading purposes 

we are exposed to interest rate risk as it relates to our fixed rate debt primarily our senior notes and our variable rate credit facility and loan repurchase facility changes to interest rates generally affect the fair value of fixedrate debt instruments but not earnings or cash flows for variable rate debt interest rate changes generally will not affect the fair value of the variable debt instruments but will affect earnings and cash flow at december 31 2020 there was no debt outstanding under our credit facility or loan repurchase facility see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included herein for further discussion of these debt instruments 

our mortgage banking segment is exposed to interest rate risk as it relates to its lending activities including originating mortgage loans and providing rate lock commitments to borrowers to mitigate the effect of the interest rate risk inherent in providing rate lock commitments to borrowers we enter into optional or mandatory delivery forward sales contracts to sell whole loans and mortgagebacked securities to investors the forward sales contracts lockin a range of interest rates and prices for the sale of loans similar to the specific rate lock commitments we do not engage in speculative or trading derivative activities all of the mortgage banking segment’s loan portfolio is held for sale and subject to forward sale commitments see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note 15 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included herein for further discussion of these items 

the following table represents the contractual balances of our onbalance sheet financial instruments at the expected maturity dates as well as the fair values of those onbalance sheet financial instruments at december 31 2020 the expected maturity categories take into consideration the actual and anticipated amortization of principal and do not take into consideration the reinvestment of cash or the refinancing of existing indebtedness because we sell all of the mortgage loans we originate into the secondary markets we have made the assumption that the portfolio of mortgage loans held for sale will mature in the first year

 item 1 business 

general 

nvr inc a virginia corporation was formed in 1980 as nvhomes inc our primary business is the construction and sale of singlefamily detached homes townhomes and condominium buildings all of which are primarily constructed on a presold basis to more fully serve customers of our homebuilding operations we also operate a mortgage banking and title services business we conduct our homebuilding activities directly our mortgage banking operations are operated primarily through a wholly owned subsidiary nvr mortgage finance inc “nvrm” unless the context otherwise requires references to “nvr” “we” “us” or “our” include nvr inc and its consolidated subsidiaries 

we are one of the largest homebuilders in the united states we operate in multiple locations in fourteen states which are primarily in the eastern part of the country and in washington dc during 2019 approximately 22 and 9 of our home settlements occurred in the washington dc and baltimore md metropolitan areas respectively which accounted for approximately 27 and 11 respectively of our 2019 homebuilding revenues our homebuilding operations include the construction and sale of singlefamily detached homes townhomes and condominium buildings under three trade names ryan homes nvhomes and heartland homes our ryan homes product is marketed primarily to firsttime and firsttime moveup buyers ryan homes operates in thirtytwo metropolitan areas located in maryland virginia washington dc west virginia pennsylvania new york north carolina south carolina florida ohio new jersey delaware indiana illinois and tennessee our nvhomes and heartland homes products are marketed primarily to moveup and luxury buyers nvhomes operates in delaware and the washington dc baltimore md and philadelphia pa metropolitan areas heartland homes operates in the pittsburgh pa metropolitan area 

we generally do not engage in land development see discussion below of our land development activities instead we typically acquire finished building lots at market prices from various third party land developers pursuant to fixed price finished lot purchase agreements “lot purchase agreements” that require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the lot purchase agreements the deposits required under the lot purchase agreements are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and typically range up to 10 of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots 

we believe that our lot acquisition strategy avoids the financial requirements and risks associated with direct land ownership and land development we may at our option choose for any reason and at any time not to perform under these lot purchase agreements by delivering notice of our intent not to acquire the finished lots under contract our sole legal obligation and economic loss for failure to perform under these lot purchase agreements is limited to the amount of the deposit pursuant to the liquidated damage provision contained within the lot purchase agreements we do not have any financial guarantees or completion obligations and we typically do not guarantee lot purchases on a specific performance basis under these lot purchase agreements none of the creditors of any of the development entities with which we have entered these lot purchase agreements have recourse to our general credit we generally seek to maintain control over a supply of lots believed to be suitable to meet our fiveyear business plan 

in addition to constructing homes primarily on a presold basis and utilizing what we believe is a conservative lot acquisition strategy we focus on obtaining and maintaining a leading market position in each market we serve this strategy allows us to gain valuable efficiencies and competitive advantages in our markets which we believe contributes to minimizing the adverse effects of regional economic cycles and provides growth opportunities within these markets our continued success is contingent upon our ability to control an adequate supply of finished lots on which to build as a result in certain specific strategic circumstances we deviate from our historical lot acquisition strategy and engage in joint venture arrangements with land developers or directly acquire raw ground already zoned for its intended use for development once we acquire control of raw ground we determine whether to sell the raw parcel to a developer and enter into a lot purchase agreement with the developer to purchase the finished lots or hire a developer to develop the land on our behalf while joint venture arrangements and direct land development activity are not our preferred method of acquiring finished building lots we may enter into additional transactions in the future on a limited basis where there exists a compelling strategic or prudent financial reason to do so we expect however to continue to acquire substantially all of our finished lot inventory using lot purchase agreements with forfeitable deposits see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 of this form 10k for additional discussion of lots controlled in addition see notes 3 4 and 5 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information regarding lot purchase agreements joint ventures and land under development respectively 

in addition to building and selling homes we provide a number of mortgagerelated services through our mortgage banking operations through operations in each of our homebuilding markets nvrm originates mortgage loans almost exclusively for our homebuyers nvrm generates revenues primarily from origination fees gains on sales of loans and title fees nvrm sells all of the mortgage loans it closes into the secondary markets on a servicing released basis 

segment information for our homebuilding and mortgage banking businesses is included in note 2 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

homebuilding 

products 

we offer singlefamily detached homes townhomes and condominium buildings with many different basic home designs these home designs have a variety of elevations and numerous other options our homes combine traditional transitional cottage or urban exterior designs with contemporary interior designs and amenities generally include two to four bedrooms and range from approximately 1000 to 9500 finished square feet during 2019  the prices at which we settled homes ranged from approximately 140000 to 15 million and averaged  367100  during 2018  our average price of homes settled was  379700  

markets 

our four reportable homebuilding segments operate in the following geographic regions 



backlog 

backlog which represents homes sold but not yet settled with the customer totaled 8233 units and approximately 31 billion at december 31 2019 compared to 8365 units and approximately 32 billion at december 31 2018  backlog may be impacted by customer cancellations for various reasons that are beyond our control such as the customer’s failure to obtain mortgage financing inability to sell an existing home job loss or a variety of other reasons in any period a portion of the cancellations that we experience are related to new sales that occurred during the same period and a portion are related to sales that occurred in prior periods and therefore appeared in the opening backlog for the current period expressed as the total of all cancellations during the period as a percentage of gross sales during the period our cancellation rate was 146  145 and 140 in 2019  2018  and 2017  respectively additionally approximately 6 in 2019 5 in 2018 and 6 in 2017 of a reporting quarter’s opening backlog balance cancelled during the quarter we can provide no assurance that our historical cancellation rates are indicative of the actual cancellation rate that may occur in future periods other than those units that are cancelled we expect to settle substantially all of our december 31 2019 backlog during 2020 see “risk factors” in item 1a and “seasonality” in item 7 of this form 10k 

further discussion of settlements new orders and backlog activity by our homebuilding reportable segment for each of the last three years can be found in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 of this form 10k 

construction 

we utilize independent subcontractors under fixed price contracts to perform construction work on our homes we use many independent subcontractors in our various markets and we are not dependent on any single subcontractor or on a small number of subcontractors 

sales and marketing 

our preferred marketing method is for customers to visit a furnished model home featuring many builtin options and a landscaped lot the garages of these model homes are usually converted into temporary sales centers where alternative facades and floor plans are displayed and designs for other models are available for review sales representatives are compensated predominantly on a commission basis 

regulation 

we and our subcontractors must comply with various federal state and local zoning building environmental advertising and consumer credit statutes rules and regulations as well as other regulations and requirements in connection with our construction and sales activities all of these regulations have increased the cost to produce and market our products and in some instances have delayed our developers’ ability to deliver finished lots to us counties and cities in which we build homes have at times declared moratoriums on the issuance of building permits and imposed other restrictions in the areas in which sewage treatment facilities and other public facilities do not reach minimum standards in addition our homebuilding operations are regulated in certain areas by restrictive zoning and density requirements that limit the number of homes that can be built within the boundaries of a particular area to date restrictive zoning laws and the imposition of moratoriums have not had a material adverse effect on our construction activities 

competition and market factors 

the housing industry is highly competitive we compete with numerous homebuilders of varying size ranging from local to national in scope some of which have greater financial resources than we do we also face competition from the home resale market 

our homebuilding operations compete primarily on the basis of price location design quality service and reputation historically we have been one of the market leaders in each of the markets where we build homes 

the housing industry is cyclical and is affected by consumer confidence levels prevailing economic conditions and interest rates other factors that affect the housing industry and the demand for new homes include the availability and the cost of land labor and materials changes in consumer preferences demographic trends and the availability of mortgage finance programs see “risk factors” in item 1a of this form 10k for additional information regarding these risks 

we are dependent upon building material suppliers for a continuous flow of raw materials whenever possible we utilize standard products available from multiple sources in the past such raw materials have been generally available to us in adequate supply 

mortgage banking 

we provide a number of mortgage related services to our homebuilding customers through our mortgage banking operations our mortgage banking operations also include separate subsidiaries that broker title insurance and perform title searches in connection with mortgage loan closings for which they receive commissions and fees because nvrm originates mortgage loans almost exclusively for our homebuilding customers nvrm is dependent on our homebuilding segment in 2019 nvrm closed approximately 16500 loans with an aggregate principal amount of approximately 52 billion as compared to approximately 15100 loans with an aggregate principal amount of approximately 48 billion in 2018 

nvrm sells all of the mortgage loans it closes to investors in the secondary markets on a servicing released basis typically within 30 days from the loan closing nvrm is an approved sellerservicer for fannie mae “fnma” and freddie mac fhlmc mortgage loans and an approved sellerissuer of ginnie mae “gnma” department of veterans affairs “va” and federal housing administration “fha” mortgage loans 

regulation 

nvrm is subject to the rules and regulations of fnma gnma fhlmc va and fha these rules and regulations restrict certain activities of nvrm nvrm is currently eligible and expects to remain eligible to participate in such programs in addition nvrm is subject to regulation at the state and federal level including regulations issued by the consumer financial protection bureau the “cfpb” with respect to specific origination selling and servicing practices 

competition and market factors 

nvrm’s main competition comes from national regional and local mortgage bankers mortgage brokers credit unions and banks in each of these markets nvrm competes primarily on the basis of customer service variety of products offered interest rates offered prices of ancillary services and relative financing availability and costs 

pipeline 

nvrm’s mortgage loans in process that had not closed had an aggregate principal balance of approximately 22 billion as of both december 31 2019 and 2018 nvrm’s cancellation rate was approximately 36 32 and 31 in 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively we can provide no assurance that our historical loan cancellation rates are indicative of the actual loan cancellation rate that may occur in future periods see “risk factors” in item 1a in this form 10k for additional information about factors that could increase our cancellation rate 

employees 

at december 31 2019 we employed approximately 5700 fulltime persons none of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement and we have never experienced a work stoppage we believe that our employee relations are good

 item 1a risk factors 

our business is affected by the risks generally incident to the residential construction business including but not limited to 

 all of these risks are discussed in detail below 

an economic downturn or decline in economic conditions could adversely affect our business and our results of operations 

demand for new homes is sensitive to economic changes driven by conditions such as employment levels job growth consumer confidence and interest rates if the housing industry suffers a downturn our sales may decline which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

interest rate movements inflation and other economic factors can negatively impact our business 

high rates of inflation generally affect the homebuilding industry adversely because of their adverse impact on interest rates high interest rates not only increase the cost of borrowed funds to homebuilders but also have a significant adverse effect on housing demand and on the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective purchasers we are also subject to potential volatility in the price of commodities that impact costs of materials used in our homebuilding business increases in prevailing interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

our financial results also are affected by the risks generally incident to our mortgage banking business including interest rate levels the impact of government regulation on mortgage loan originations and servicing and the need to issue forward commitments to fund and sell mortgage loans our homebuilding customers account for almost all of our mortgage banking business the volume of our continuing homebuilding operations therefore affects our mortgage banking business 

our mortgage banking business also is affected by interest rate fluctuations we also may experience marketing losses resulting from daily increases in interest rates to the extent we are unable to match interest rates and amounts on loans we have committed to originate with forward commitments from third parties to purchase such loans increases in interest rates may have a material adverse effect on our mortgage banking revenue profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

our operations may also be adversely affected by other economic factors within our markets such as negative changes in employment levels job growth wage growth consumer confidence and household formation and availability of mortgage financing one or all of which could result in reduced demand or price depression from current levels such negative trends could have a material adverse effect on homebuilding operations 

these factors and thus the homebuilding and mortgage banking businesses have at times in the past been cyclical in nature any downturn in the national economy or the local economies of the markets in which we operate could have a material adverse effect 

on our sales profitability stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations in particular during 2019  approximately 22 and 9 of our home settlements occurred in the washington dc and baltimore md metropolitan areas respectively which accounted for approximately 27 and 11  respectively of our 2019 homebuilding revenues thus we are dependent to a significant extent on the economy and demand for housing in those areas 

because almost all of our customers require mortgage financing the availability of suitable mortgage financing could impair the affordability of our homes lower demand for our products and limit our ability to fully deliver our backlog 

our business and earnings depend on the ability of our potential customers to obtain mortgages for the purchase of our homes in addition many of our potential customers must sell their existing homes in order to buy a home from us the tightening of credit standards and the availability of suitable mortgage financing could prevent customers from buying our homes and could prevent buyers of our customers’ homes from obtaining mortgages they need to complete that purchase either of which could result in potential customers’ inability to buy a home from us if potential customers or the buyers of our customers’ current homes are not able to obtain suitable financing the result could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

if our ability to sell mortgages to investors is impaired we may be required to fund these commitments ourselves or we may not be able to originate loans at all 

our mortgage banking business sells all of the loans it originates into the secondary market usually within 30 days from the date of closing and has up to 150 million available under a repurchase agreement to fund mortgage closings see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – liquidity and capital resources” in item 7 of this form 10k for more information about the repurchase agreement in the event that disruptions to the secondary markets tighten or eliminate the available liquidity within the secondary markets for mortgage loans or the underwriting requirements by our secondary market investors continue to become more stringent our ability to sell future mortgages could decline and we could be required among other things to fund our commitments to our buyers with our own financial resources which is limited or require our home buyers to find another source of financing the result of such secondary market disruption could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

if the market value of our inventory or controlled lot position declines our profit could decrease and we may incur losses 

inventory risk can be substantial for homebuilders the market value of building lots and housing inventories can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing market conditions in addition inventory carrying costs can be significant and can result in losses in a poorly performing community or market we must continuously seek and make acquisitions of lots for expansion into new markets as well as for replacement and expansion within our current markets which we generally accomplish by entering into lot purchase agreements and paying forfeitable deposits under the lot purchase agreements to developers for the contractual right to acquire the lots in the event of adverse changes in economic market or community conditions we may cease further building activities in certain communities or restructure existing lot purchase agreements resulting in forfeiture of some or all of any remaining land contract deposit paid to the developer we may also have significant impairments of land under development the forfeiture of land contract deposits or inventory impairments may result in a loss that could have a material adverse effect on our profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

if the underwriting quality of our mortgage originations is found to be deficient our profit could decrease and we may incur losses 

we originate several different loan products to our customers to finance the purchase of their home we sell all of the loans we originate into the secondary mortgage market generally within 30 days from the date of closing all of the loans that we originate are underwritten to the standards and specifications of the ultimate investor insofar as we underwrite our originated loans to those standards we bear no increased concentration of credit risk from the issuance of loans except in certain limited instances where repurchases or early payment default occur in the event that a substantial number of the loans that we have originated fall into default and the investors to whom we sold the loans determine that we did not underwrite the loans in accordance with their requirements we could be required to repurchase the loans from the investor or indemnify the investor for any losses incurred any resulting losses could have a material adverse effect on our profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

we may be subject to claims on mortgage loans sold to third parties 

our mortgage banking operations may be responsible for losses associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to investors in the event of errors or omissions relating to certain representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements including representations as to underwriting standards the type of collateral the existence of private mortgage insurance and the validity of certain borrower representations in connection with the loan the resolution of claims related to alleged breaches of these representations and warranties and repurchase claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition cash flows and results of operations and could result in losses that exceed existing estimates and accruals because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating these matters there can be no assurance that any amounts reserved will be adequate or that any potential inadequacies will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our inability to secure and control an adequate inventory of lots could adversely impact our operations 

the results of our homebuilding operations depend upon our continuing ability to control an adequate number of homebuilding lots in desirable locations there can be no assurance that an adequate supply of building lots will continue to be available to us on terms similar to those available in the past or that we will not be required to devote a greater amount of capital to controlling building lots than we have historically an insufficient supply of building lots in one or more of our markets an inability of our developers to deliver finished lots in a timely fashion due to their inability to secure financing to fund development activities or for other reasons or our inability to purchase or finance building lots on reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

volatility in the credit and capital markets may impact our ability to access necessary financing 

if we require working capital greater than that provided by our operations and our credit facility we may be required to seek to increase the amount available under the facility or seek alternative financing which might not be available on terms that are favorable or acceptable if we are required to seek financing to fund our working capital requirements volatility in credit or capital markets may restrict our flexibility to access financing if we are at any time unsuccessful in obtaining sufficient capital to fund our planned homebuilding expenditures we may experience a substantial delay in the completion of homes then under construction or we may be unable to control or purchase finished building lots any delay could result in cost increases and could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

our mortgage banking operations depend in part on the availability cost and other terms of mortgage financing facilities and may be adversely affected by any shortage or increased cost of such financing additional or replacement financing might not be available on terms that are favorable or acceptable our mortgage banking operations are also dependent upon the securitization market for mortgagebacked securities and could be materially adversely affected by any fluctuation or downturn in such market 

our current indebtedness may impact our future operations 

our existing indebtedness contains restrictive covenants and any future indebtedness may also contain such covenants these covenants include or could include restrictions on our ability to create incur assume or guarantee secured debt enter into sale and leaseback transactions and conditions related to mergers andor the sale of assets substantial losses by us or other action or inaction by us or our subsidiaries could result in the violation of one or more of these covenants which could result in decreased liquidity or a default on our current or future indebtedness thereby having a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

government regulations and environmental matters could negatively affect our operations 

we are subject to various local state and federal statutes ordinances rules and regulations concerning zoning building design construction and similar matters including local regulations that impose restrictive zoning and density requirements in order to limit the number of homes that can eventually be built within the boundaries of a particular area these regulations may further increase the cost to produce and market our products in addition we have from time to time been subject to and may also be subject in the future to periodic delays in our homebuilding projects due to building moratoriums in the areas in which we operate or delays in receiving the necessary governmental approvals changes in regulations that restrict homebuilding activities in one or more of our principal markets could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

in addition new housing developments are often subject to various assessments or impact fees for schools parks streets highways and other public improvements the cost of these assessments is subject to substantial change and could cause increases in the construction cost of our homes which in turn could reduce our profitability 

we are also subject to a variety of local state and federal statutes ordinances rules and regulations concerning the protection of health and the environment we are subject to a variety of environmental conditions that can affect our business and our homebuilding projects the particular environmental laws that apply to any given homebuilding site vary greatly according to the location and environmental condition of the site and the present and former uses of the site and adjoining properties environmental laws and conditions may result in delays cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs or prohibit or severely restrict homebuilding activity in certain environmentally sensitive regions or areas thereby adversely affecting our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

increased regulation of the mortgage industry could harm our future sales and earnings 

the mortgage industry remains under intense scrutiny and continues to face increasing regulation at the federal state and local level potential changes to federal laws and regulations could have the effect of limiting the activities of fnma and fhlmc the entities that provide liquidity to the secondary mortgage market which could lead to increases in mortgage interest rates tighter underwriting requirements and fee restrictions and the increasingly complex regulatory environment may negatively impact our mortgage loan origination business in the form of lower demand decreased revenue and increased operating costs 

we are an approved sellerservicer of fnma and fhlmc mortgage loans and an approved sellerissuer of gnma va and fha mortgage loans and are subject to all of those agencies’ rules and regulations any significant impairment of our eligibility to sellservice these loans could have a material adverse impact on our mortgage operations in addition we are subject to regulation at the state and federal level with respect to specific origination selling and servicing practices including the real estate settlement and protection act adverse changes in governmental regulation may have a negative impact on our mortgage loan origination business 

we face competition in our homebuilding and mortgage banking operations 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive we compete with numerous homebuilders of varying size ranging from local to national in scope some of whom have greater financial resources than we do we face competition 

 our homebuilding operations compete primarily on the basis of price location design quality service and reputation 

the mortgage banking industry is also competitive our main competition comes from national regional and local mortgage bankers credit unions banks and mortgage brokers in each of these markets our mortgage banking operations compete primarily on the basis of customer service variety of products offered interest rates offered prices of ancillary services and relative financing availability and costs 

we might not be able to continue to compete successfully in our homebuilding or mortgage banking operations an inability to effectively compete may have an adverse impact on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

a shortage of building materials or labor or increases in materials or labor costs may adversely impact our operations 

the homebuilding business has from time to time experienced building material and labor shortages including fluctuating lumber prices and supply in addition strong construction market conditions could restrict the labor force available to our subcontractors and us in one or more of our markets significant increases in costs resulting from these shortages or delays in construction of homes could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

we rely on subcontractors to construct our homes the failure of our subcontractors to properly construct our homes may be costly 

we engage subcontractors to perform the actual construction of our homes despite our quality control efforts we may discover that our subcontractors have engaged in improper construction practices the occurrence of such events could require us to repair the homes in accordance with our standards and as required by law the cost of satisfying our legal obligations in these instances may be significant and we may be unable to recover the cost of repair from subcontractors suppliers and insurers 

product liability litigation and warranty claims may adversely impact our operations 

construction defect and home warranty claims are common and can represent a substantial risk for the homebuilding industry the cost of insuring against construction defect and product liability claims as well as the claims themselves can be high in addition insurance companies limit coverage offered to protect against these claims further restrictions on coverage availability or significant increases in premium costs or claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

we are subject to litigation proceedings that could harm our business if an unfavorable ruling were to occur 

from time to time we are involved in litigation and other legal proceedings relating to claims arising from our operations in the normal course of business as described in but not limited to item 3 “legal proceedings” of this form 10k we are currently subject to certain legal proceedings litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings may occur these or other litigation or legal proceedings could materially affect our ability to conduct our business in the manner that we expect or otherwise adversely affect us should an unfavorable ruling occur 

the loss of key personnel could adversely impact our business 

we rely on our key personnel to effectively operate and manage our business specifically our future success depends heavily on the performance of our senior management team our business may be adversely affected if we are unable to retain key personnel or attract qualified personnel to manage our business 

our failure to maintain the security of our electronic and other confidential information could expose us to liability and materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

privacy security and compliance concerns have continued to increase as technology has evolved as part of our normal business activities we collect and store certain confidential information including personal information of homebuyersborrowers and information about employees vendors and suppliers this information is entitled to protection under a number of federal and state 

laws we may share some of this information with vendors who assist us with certain aspects of our business particularly our mortgage and title businesses we have implemented systems and processes intended to secure our information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive confidential and personal data including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies additionally we have increased our monitoring capabilities to enhance early detection and rapid response to potential security anomalies these security measures may not be sufficient for all possible occurrences and may be vulnerable to hacking employee error malfeasance system error faulty password management or other irregularities further development and maintenance of these measures are costly and require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become increasingly sophisticated our failure to maintain the security of the data we are required to protect including via the penetration of our network security and the misappropriation of confidential and personal information could result in business disruption damage to our reputation financial obligations to third parties fines penalties regulatory proceedings and private litigation with potentially large costs and also in deterioration in customers’ confidence in us and other competitive disadvantages and thus could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

our continued success is dependent on positive perceptions of us and our brands which if eroded could adversely affect our business and our relationships with our customers 

we believe that one of the reasons our customers buy from us our team members choose nvr as a place of employment and our vendors choose to do business with us is the reputation we have built over many years to be successful in the future we must continue to preserve our reputation reputational value is based in large part on perceptions and broad access to social media makes it easy for anyone to provide public feedback that can influence perceptions of the brands under which we do business it may be difficult to control negative publicity regardless of whether it is accurate while reputations may take decades to build negative incidents can quickly erode trust and confidence could damage our reputation reduce the demand for our homes or negatively impact the morale and performance of our employees all of which could adversely affect our business 

weatherrelated and other events beyond our control may adversely impact our operations 

extreme weather or other events such as significant snowfalls hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes forest fires floods terrorist attacks or war may affect our markets our operations and our profitability these events may impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or subcontractors and our housing inventories causing us material increases in costs or delays in construction of homes which could have a material adverse effect upon our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows

overview 

business 

our primary business is the construction and sale of singlefamily detached homes townhomes and condominium buildings all of which are primarily constructed on a presold basis to fully serve customers of our homebuilding operations we also operate a mortgage banking and title services business we primarily conduct our operations in mature markets additionally we generally grow our business through market share gains in our existing markets and by expanding into markets contiguous to our current active markets our four homebuilding reportable segments consist of the following regions 

  

our lot acquisition strategy is predicated upon avoiding the financial requirements and risks associated with direct land ownership and development we generally do not engage in land development see discussion below of our land development activities instead we typically acquire finished lots at market prices from various third party land developers pursuant to lot purchase agreements these lot purchase agreements require deposits typically ranging up to 10 of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots in the form of cash or letters of credit that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the lot purchase agreement this strategy has allowed us to maximize inventory turnover which we believe enables us to minimize market risk and to operate with less capital thereby enhancing rates of return on equity and total capital 

in addition to constructing homes primarily on a presold basis and utilizing what we believe is a conservative lot acquisition strategy we focus on obtaining and maintaining a leading market position in each market we serve this strategy allows us to gain valuable efficiencies and competitive advantages in our markets which we believe contributes to minimizing the adverse effects of regional economic cycles and provides growth opportunities within these markets our continued success is contingent upon our ability to control an adequate supply of finished lots on which to build 

in limited specific strategic circumstances we deviate from our historical lot acquisition strategy and engage in joint venture arrangements with land developers or directly acquire raw ground already zoned for its intended use for development once we acquire control of raw ground we determine whether to sell the raw parcel to a developer and enter into a lot purchase agreement with the developer to purchase the finished lots or to hire a developer to develop the land on our behalf while joint venture arrangements and direct land development activity are not our preferred method of acquiring finished building lots we may enter into additional transactions in the future on a limited basis where there exists a compelling strategic or prudent financial reason to do so we expect however to continue to acquire substantially all of our finished lot inventory using lot purchase agreements with forfeitable deposits 

as of december 31 2019  we controlled lots as described below 

lot purchase agreements 

we controlled approximately 101300 lots under lot purchase agreements with third parties through deposits in cash and letters of credit totaling approximately 439500 and 5500  respectively included in the number of controlled lots are approximately 4600 lots for which we have recorded a contract land deposit impairment reserve of approximately 27600 as of december 31 2019  

joint venture limited liability corporations “jvs” 

we had an aggregate investment totaling approximately 26700 in five jvs expected to produce approximately 6300 lots of the lots to be produced by the jvs approximately 2950 lots were controlled by us and approximately 3350 lots were either under contract with unrelated parties or currently not under contract 

land under development 

we directly owned five separate raw land parcels zoned for their intended use with a current cost basis including development costs of approximately 69200 that we intend to develop into approximately 650 finished lots we had additional funding 

commitments of approximately 6100 under a joint development agreement related to one parcel a portion of which we expect will be offset by development credits of approximately 2800  

see notes 3 4 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information regarding lot purchase agreements jvs and land under development respectively 

raw land purchase agreements 

in addition to the lots we currently control as discussed above we have certain properties under contract with land owners that are expected to yield approximately 7000 lots some of these properties may require rezoning or other approvals to achieve the expected yield these properties are controlled with cash deposits and letters of credit totaling approximately 1900 and 100  respectively as of december 31 2019  of which approximately 900 is refundable if we do not perform under the contract we generally expect to assign the raw land contracts to a land developer and simultaneously enter into a lot purchase agreement with the assignee if the project is determined to be feasible 

current business environment and key financial results 

during 2019  general market conditions were favorably impacted by low unemployment and strong consumer confidence additionally affordability issues which had slowed demand for new homes during the second half of 2018 were favorably impacted by a pull back in interest rates throughout 2019 which contributed to improved demand 

our consolidated revenues for the year ended december 31 2019 totaled 7388664  an increase of 3 from 7163674 in 2018  our net income for 2019 was 878539  or 22113 per diluted share increases of 10 and 14 compared to 2018 net income and diluted earnings per share respectively our homebuilding gross profit margin percentage increased to 190 in 2019 from 187 in 2018  new orders net of cancellations “new orders” during 2019 were 19536  an increase of 7 from 2018 while our average new order sales price decreased 2 to  3684 in 2019  our backlog of homes sold but not yet settled with the customer as of december 31 2019 decreased on a unit basis by 2 to 8233 units and decreased on a dollar basis by 1 to 3130282 when compared to december 31 2018  

we believe that the strength in demand for new homes is dependent upon sustained economic growth driven by favorable unemployment levels and continued improvements in wage growth and household formation demand is also impacted by homebuyer affordability concerns which are driven by both home prices and interest rate movements we expect to continue to face gross profit margin pressure which will be impacted by modest pricing power and our ability to manage land and construction costs we also expect to face pressure on mortgage banking profit due to the competitive pricing pressures in the mortgage market we believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities that may arise from future economic and homebuilding market volatility due to the strength of our balance sheet 

homebuilding operations 

the following table summarizes the results of our consolidated homebuilding operations and certain operating activity for each of the last three years 



consolidated homebuilding 

homebuilding revenues increased 3 in 2019 compared to 2018  as a result of a 7 increase in the number of units settled offset by a 3 decrease in the average settlement price year over year the increase in the number of units settled was primarily attributable to a higher backlog turnover rate year over year the decrease in the average settlement price was attributable to a 2 lower average price of units in backlog entering 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 and to a shift in settlements to smaller lower priced products and to lower priced markets in 2019  gross profit margin percentage in 2019 increased slightly to 190 from 187 in 2018    

the number of new orders increased 7 while the average sales price of new orders decreased 2 in 2019 when compared to 2018  the increase in new orders was attributable primarily to an increase in new orders in our mid east and south east market segments partially driven by an increase in the average number of active communities in each of these segments additionally more favorable market conditions in 2019 led to a higher community absorption rate year over year the decrease in the average sales price of new orders was attributable to a shift to markets with lower average sales prices as well as a continued shift to smaller lower priced products 

selling general and administrative sga expenses in 2019 increased by 4 compared to 2018  and as a percentage of revenue increased slightly to 62 in 2019 from 61 in 2018  sga expenses were higher primarily due to an approximate 12100 increase in personnel costs and an increase in equitybased compensation attributable to incurring a full year of expense for the equity awards granted in the second quarter of 2018 

backlog units and dollars were 8233 units and 3130282 respectively as of december 31 2019 compared to 8365 units and 3152873 respectively as of december 31 2018  the 2 decrease in backlog units is attributable primarily to a higher backlog turnover rate year over year the decrease in backlog dollars was primarily attributable to the decrease in backlog units 

backlog may be impacted by customer cancellations for various reasons that are beyond our control such as failure to obtain mortgage financing inability to sell an existing home job loss or a variety of other reasons in any period a portion of the cancellations that we experience are related to new orders that occurred during the same period and a portion are related to new orders that occurred in prior periods and therefore appeared in the beginning backlog for the current period expressed as the total of all cancellations during the period as a percentage of gross new orders during the period our cancellation rate was 146  145 and 140 in 2019  2018  and 2017  respectively additionally approximately 6 in 2019  5 in 2018 and 6 in 2017  of a reporting quarter’s opening backlog cancelled during the quarter we can provide no assurance that our historical cancellation rates are indicative of the actual cancellation rate that may occur in future years other than those units that are cancelled we expect to settle substantially all of our december 31 2019 backlog during 2020 see “risk factors” in item 1a of this form 10k 

the backlog turnover rate is impacted by various factors including but not limited to changes in new order activity internal production capacity external subcontractor capacity and other external factors over which we do not exercise control 

reportable homebuilding segments 

homebuilding segment profit before tax includes all revenues and income generated from the sale of homes less the cost of homes sold sga expenses and a corporate capital allocation charge determined by corporate management the corporate capital allocation charge eliminates in consolidation and is based on the segment’s average net assets employed the corporate capital allocation charged to the operating segment allows the chief operating decision maker to determine whether the operating segment is providing the desired rate of return after covering our cost of capital 

we record charges on contract land deposits when we determine that it is probable that recovery of the deposit is impaired for segment reporting purposes impairments on contract land deposits are generally charged to the operating segment upon the termination of a lot purchase agreement with the developer or the restructuring of a lot purchase agreement resulting in the forfeiture of the deposit we evaluate our entire net contract land deposit portfolio for impairment each quarter for presentation purposes below the contract land deposit reserve at december 31 2019 and 2018 has been allocated to the reportable segments for the respective years to show contract land deposits on a net basis the net contract land deposit balances below also include approximately 5500 and 3900 at december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively of letters of credit issued as deposits in lieu of cash

mid atlantic 

the mid atlantic segment had an approximate 16400 or 4 increase in segment profit in 2019 compared to 2018 driven primarily by improved margins year over year and reduced marketing costs attributable to a 12 decrease in the average number of active communities year over year segment revenues were relatively flat year over year as the 4 increase in the number of units settled was offset by a 4 decrease in the average settlement price year over year the increase in the number of units settled is attributable primarily to a higher backlog turnover rate year over year the average settlement price in the current year was negatively impacted by a shift in settlements to lower priced products and lower priced markets within the segment the mid atlantic segment’s gross profit margin percentage was essentially flat increasing to 188 in 2019 from 187 in 2018 

segment new orders and the average sales price of new orders each decreased 1 in 2019 compared to 2018 the decrease in new orders was due primarily to a 12 decrease in the average number of active communities year over year offset by a higher community absorption rate year over year the decrease in the average sales price of new orders is attributable to a relative shift in new orders to lower priced products and a shift to markets with lower average sales prices within the segment 

north east 

the north east segment had an approximate 18100 or 26 decrease in segment profit in 2019 compared to 2018 driven primarily by a decrease in segment revenues of approximately 65900 or 11 year over year the decrease in segment revenues was attributable to decreases in the number of units settled and the average settlement price of 6 and 5 respectively due primarily to a 17 lower backlog unit balance and a 5 lower average sales price of units in backlog entering 2019 compared to the backlog entering 2018 additionally the average settlement price was negatively impacted by a shift in settlements to lower priced products the north east segment’s gross profit margin percentage decreased to 195 in 2019 from 198 in 2018 due primarily to higher construction costs offset partially by lower lot costs as a percentage of revenue 

segment new orders increased 4 while the average sales price of new orders decreased 2 in 2019 compared to 2018 new orders increased primarily due to a 7 increase in the average number of active communities in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 coupled with favorable market conditions which led to a higher segment absorption rate year over year the average sales price of new orders was negatively impacted primarily by a relative shift in new orders to lower priced products 

mid east 

the mid east segment had an approximate 1800 or 1 decrease in segment profit in 2019 compared to 2018 segment profit was lower despite an increase in segment revenues of approximately 45300 or 3 year over year segment revenues increased due to a 5 increase in the number of units settled offset partially by a 2 decrease in the average settlement price year over year the increase in the number of units settled is attributable to a higher backlog turnover rate year over year the average settlement price was negatively impacted by a shift in settlements to lower priced products and to lower priced markets within the segment the segment’s gross profit margin percentage decreased slightly to 190 in 2019 from 192 in 2018 

segment new orders increased 7 while the average sales price of new orders decreased 2 in 2019 compared to 2018 new orders increased primarily due to a 12 increase in the average number of active communities in 2019 compared to 2018 the average sales price of new orders was negatively impacted by a relative shift to lower priced products and a shift to markets with lower average sales prices within the segment 

south east 

t he south east segment had an approximate 36800 or 31 increase in segment profit in 2019 compared to 2018 the increase in segment profit was driven primarily by an increase in segment revenues of approximately 228900 or 21 year over year due primarily to a 20 increase in the number of units settled the increase in settlements was primarily attributable to a 7 higher backlog unit balance entering 2019 compared to the backlog unit balance entering 2018 coupled with a 19 increase in new orders for the first six months of 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 the south east segment’s gross profit margin percentage increased to 200 in 2019 from 197 in 2018 primarily due to lower lumber costs offset partially by higher lot costs as a percentage of revenue year over year 

segment new orders and the average sales price of new orders increased 26 and 2 respectively in 2019 compared to 2018 new orders increased primarily due to an 11 increase in the average number of active communities and by favorable market conditions which led to a higher segment absorption rate year over year the average sales price of new orders was favorably impacted by a relative shift to markets within the segment with higher average sales prices 

homebuilding segment reconciliations to consolidated homebuilding operations 

in addition to the corporate capital allocation and contract land deposit impairments discussed above the other reconciling items between homebuilding segment profit and homebuilding consolidated profit before tax include unallocated corporate overhead which includes all management incentive compensation equitybased compensation expense consolidation adjustments and external corporate interest expense our overhead functions such as accounting treasury and human resources are centrally performed and the costs are not allocated to our operating segments consolidation adjustments consist of such items to convert the reportable segments’ results which are predominantly maintained on a cash basis to a full accrual basis for external financial statement presentation purposes and are not allocated to our operating segments external corporate interest expense is primarily comprised of interest charges on our 395 senior notes due 2022 the “senior notes” and is not charged to the operating segments because the charges are included in the corporate capital allocation discussed above 



  



  

 

mortgage banking segment 

we conduct our mortgage banking activity through nvrm a wholly owned subsidiary nvrm focuses almost exclusively on serving the homebuilding segment customer base the following table summarizes the results of our mortgage banking operations and certain statistical data for each of the last three years 



loan closing volume in 2019 increased by approximately 335300 or 7 from 2018  the increase was primarily attributable to a 10 increase in the number of loans closed year over year due primarily to the aforementioned increase in the homebuilding segment’s number of settlements in 2019 as compared to 2018 and was partially offset by a 2 decrease in the average loan amount in 2019 as compared to 2018  

segment profit in 2019 increased by approximately 11800 or 13 from 2018  the increase in segment profit was primarily attributable to an increase in mortgage banking fees mortgage banking fees increased by approximately 8500 or 5 resulting from the aforementioned increase in loan closing volume 

mortgage banking – other 

we sell all of the loans we originate into the secondary mortgage market insofar as we underwrite our originated loans to the standards and specifications of the ultimate investor we have no further financial obligations from the issuance of loans except in certain limited instances where repurchases or early payment default occur those underwriting standards are typically equal to or more stringent than the underwriting standards required by fnma gnma fhlmc va and fha because we sell all of our loans and do not service them there is often a substantial delay between the time that a loan goes into default and the time that the investor requests us to reimburse them for losses incurred because of the default we believe that all of the loans that we originate are underwritten to the standards and specifications of the ultimate investor to whom we sell our originated loans we employ a quality control department to ensure that our underwriting controls are effective and further assess the underwriting function as part of our assessment of internal controls over financial reporting 

we maintain a reserve for losses on mortgage loans originated that reflects our judgment of the present loss exposure from the loans that we have originated and sold at december 31 2019  we had a repurchase reserve of approximately 18500  

nvrm is dependent on our homebuilding operation’s customers for business if new orders and selling prices of the homebuilding segment decline nvrm’s operations will also be adversely affected in addition nvrm’s operating results may be adversely affected in future periods due to tightening and volatility of the credit markets changes in investor funding times increased regulation of mortgage lending practices and increased competition in the mortgage market 

seasonality 

we generally have higher new order activity in the first half of the year and higher home settlements revenues and net income in the second half of the year

our consolidated effective tax rate in 2019  2018 and 2017 was 1436  1694 and 3653  respectively the lower effective tax rate in 2019 compared to 2018 is attributable primarily to the retroactive reinstatement of certain expired energy tax credits under the further consolidated appropriations act which resulted in the recognition of a tax benefit of approximately 15100 in 2019 related to homes settled in 2018 and 2019 the lower effective tax rate in 2018 compared to 2017 resulted primarily from the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act the act in december 2017 which had the following impacts on comparability between periods 

 excluding the charge related to the net deferred tax asset remeasurement our effective tax rate in 2017 would have been 2913 

additionally our effective tax rates in 2019 2018 and 2017 were favorably impacted by the recognition of an income tax benefit related to excess tax benefits from stock option exercises of 101466 77478 and 58681 respectively we expect continued rate volatility in future years attributable to the recognition of excess tax benefits from equity plan activity and distributions from the deferred compensation plans 

the act eliminated the performancebased compensation exception from section 162m the act included a grandfathering provision for compensation pursuant to a written binding contract which was in effect on november 2 2017 and which was not modified in any material respect after such date we believe that our outstanding equity grants and amounts in the deferred compensation plans as of december 31 2017 are in compliance with the grandfathering provision of the act and thus will remain deductible to the extent they are considered performancebased compensation

senior notes 

our homebuilding segment funds its operations from cash flows provided by operating activities a shortterm unsecured working capital revolving credit facility and capital raised in the public debt and equity markets on september 10 2012 we completed an offering for 600000 aggregate principal amount of 395 senior notes due 2022 under a shelf registration statement filed on september 5 2012 with the sec the senior notes were issued at a discount to yield 397 and have been reflected net of the unamortized discount in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet the senior notes mature on september 15 2022 and bear interest at 395 payable semiannually in arrears on march 15 and september 15 

the senior notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with any of our existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness will rank senior in right of payment to any of our future indebtedness that is by its terms expressly subordinated to the senior notes and will be effectively subordinated to any of our existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness the indenture governing the senior notes does not contain any financial covenants however it does contain among other items and subject to certain exceptions covenants that restrict our ability to create incur assume or guarantee secured debt enter into sale and leaseback transactions and conditions related to mergers andor the sale of assets we were in compliance with all covenants under the senior notes at december 31 2019  

credit agreement 

on july 15 2016 we entered into an unsecured credit agreement the “credit agreement” with bank of america na as administrative agent swing line lender and lc issuer merrill lynch pierce fenner  smith incorporated as sole lead arranger and sole book runner and the other lenders party thereto which provides for aggregate revolving loan commitments of 200000 the “facility” proceeds of the borrowings under the facility will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes under the credit agreement we may request increases of up to 300000 to the facility in the form of revolving loan commitments or term loans to the extent that new or existing lenders agree to provide additional revolving loan or term loan commitments 

the credit agreement provides for a 100000 sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit of which there was approximately 9700 outstanding at december 31 2019  and a 25000 sublimit for a swing line commitment borrowings under the credit agreement generally bear interest for base rate loans at a base rate equal to the highest of i a federal funds rate plus onehalf of one percent ii bank of america’s publicly announced “prime rate” and iii the eurodollar rate plus one percent plus the applicable rate which is based on our debt rating or for eurodollar rate loans at the eurodollar rate equal to libor plus the applicable rate 

the credit agreement contains various representations and affirmative and negative covenants that are generally customary for credit facilities of this type such covenants include among others the following financial maintenance covenants i minimum consolidated tangible net worth ii minimum interest coverage ratio or minimum liquidity and iii a maximum leverage ratio the negative covenants include among others certain limitations on liens investments and fundamental changes the credit agreement termination date is july 15 2021 we were in compliance with all covenants under the credit agreement at december 31 2019  there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement as of december 31 2019  

repurchase agreement 

our mortgage banking subsidiary nvrm provides for its mortgage origination and other operating activities using cash generated from operations borrowings from its parent company nvr as well as a revolving mortgage repurchase facility which is nonrecourse to nvr on july 24 2019 nvrm entered into the eleventh amendment the “amendment” to its amended and restated master repurchase agreement dated august 2 2011 with us bank national association as amended by the amendment and ten earlier amendments the “repurchase agreement” the repurchase agreement provides borrowing capacity up to 150000 subject to certain sublimits the purpose of the repurchase agreement is to finance the origination of mortgage loans by nvrm the repurchase agreement expires on july 22 2020 advances under the repurchase agreement carry a pricing rate based on the libor rate plus the libor margin as determined under the repurchase agreement provided that the pricing rate shall not be less than 185 there are several restrictions on purchased loans including that they cannot be sold to others they cannot be pledged to anyone other than the agent and they cannot support any other borrowing or repurchase agreement 

the repurchase agreement contains various affirmative and negative covenants the negative covenants include among others certain limitations on transactions involving acquisitions mergers the incurrence of debt sale of assets and creation of liens upon any of its mortgage notes additional covenants include i a tangible net worth requirement ii a minimum liquidity requirement iii a minimum net income requirement and iv a maximum leverage ratio requirement nvrm was in compliance with all covenants under the repurchase agreement at december 31 2019  at december 31 2019  there was no debt outstanding under the repurchase agreement and there were no borrowing base limitations 

equity repurchases 

in addition to funding growth in our homebuilding and mortgage banking operations we historically have used a substantial portion of our excess liquidity to repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock in open market and privately negotiated transactions this ongoing repurchase activity is conducted pursuant to publicly announced board authorizations and is typically executed in accordance with the safeharbor provisions of rule 10b18 promulgated under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended in addition the board resolutions authorizing us to repurchase shares of our common stock specifically prohibit us from purchasing shares from our officers directors profit sharing plan trust or employee stock ownership plan trust the repurchase program assists us in accomplishing our primary objective creating increases in shareholder value see “market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities” in item 5 of this form 10k for disclosure of amounts repurchased during the fourth quarter of 2019  for the year ended december 31 2019  we repurchased 220965 shares of our common stock at an aggregate purchase price of 698417  as of december 31 2019  we had 317141 available under board approved repurchase authorizations 

cash flows 

for the year ended december 31 2019  cash restricted cash and cash equivalents increased by 428556  net cash provided by operating activities was 866535  due primarily to cash provided by earnings in 2019 and net proceeds of 91178 from mortgage loan activity cash was primarily used to fund the increase in inventory of 94178 attributable to an increase in units under construction at december 31 2019 compared to december 31 2018 net cash used in investing activities in 2019 of 13284 was attributable primarily to cash used for purchases of property plant and equipment of 22699  offset partially by the receipt of capital distributions from our unconsolidated jvs totaling 8247  net cash used in financing activities of 424695  resulted primarily from our repurchase of 220965 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of 698417 under our ongoing common stock repurchase program as discussed above offset partially by 274028 in proceeds from stock option exercises 

for the year ended december 31 2018 cash and cash equivalents increased by 42691 net cash provided by operating activities was 723126 due primarily to cash provided by earnings and net proceeds of 17384 from mortgage loan activity cash was primarily used to fund the increase in contract land deposits of 30863 and the decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of 30713 net cash used in investing activities in 2018 of 8177 was attributable primarily to cash used for purchases of property plant and equipment of 19665 offset partially by the receipt of capital distributions from our unconsolidated jvs totaling 

10515 net cash used in financing activities of 672258 resulted primarily from our repurchase of 300815 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of 846134 offset partially by 174110 in proceeds from stock option exercises 

at december 31 2019 and 2018  the homebuilding segment had restricted cash of 17943 and 16982  respectively restricted cash in each year was attributable to customer deposits for certain home sales 

we believe that our current cash holdings cash generated from operations and cash available under our shortterm unsecured credit agreement revolving mortgage repurchase facility and the public debt and equity markets will be sufficient to satisfy near and long term cash requirements for working capital and debt service in both our homebuilding and mortgage banking operations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

lot acquisition strategy 

we generally do not engage in land development instead we typically acquire finished building lots at market prices from various land developers under lot purchase agreements that require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the agreement the deposits required under the lot purchase agreements are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percentage typically ranging up to 10 of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots 

we believe that our lot acquisition strategy reduces the financial requirements and risks associated with direct land ownership and land development we may at our option choose for any reason and at any time not to perform under these lot purchase agreements by delivering notice of our intent not to acquire the finished lots under contract our sole legal obligation and economic loss for failure to perform under these purchase agreements is limited to the amount of the deposit pursuant to the liquidated damage provision contained in the lot purchase agreements we do not have any financial guarantees or completion obligations and we typically do not guarantee lot purchases on a specific performance basis under these lot purchase agreements 

at december 31 2019  we controlled approximately 104900 lots through lot purchase agreements jvs and land under development with an aggregate purchase price of approximately 10000000 these lots are controlled by making or committing to make deposits of approximately 656500 in the form of cash and letters of credit our entire risk of loss pertaining to the aggregate purchase price contractual commitment resulting from our nonperformance under the contracts is limited to 439500 in deposits paid and 5500 in letters of credit issued as of december 31 2019  plus approximately 211500 related to deposits to be paid subsequent to december 31 2019 assuming that contractual development milestones are met by the developers and we exercise our option as of december 31 2019  we had recorded an impairment valuation allowance of approximately 27600 related to certain cash deposits currently outstanding additionally as of december 31 2019  we had funding commitments totaling 4300 to two of our jvs and approximately 6100 under a joint development agreement related to our land under development a portion of which we expect will be offset by development credits of approximately 2800  

in addition we have certain properties under contract with land owners that are expected to yield approximately 7000 lots which are not included in our number of total lots controlled above some of these properties may require rezoning or other approvals to achieve the expected yield these properties are controlled with cash deposits and letters of credit of approximately 1900 and 100  respectively as of december 31 2019  of which approximately 900 is refundable if we do not perform under the contract and the remainder is at risk of loss we generally expect to assign the raw land contracts to a land developer and simultaneously enter into a lot purchase agreement with the assignee if the project is determined to be feasible please refer to note 1 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of the contract land deposits and note 3 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of our lot acquisition strategy in relation to our accounting for variable interest entities 

bonds and letters of credit 

we enter into bond or letter of credit arrangements with local municipalities government agencies or land developers to collateralize our obligations under various contracts we had approximately 40600 of contingent obligations under such agreements as of december 31 2019  inclusive of the 5500 of lot acquisition deposits in the form of letters of credit discussed above we believe we will fulfill our obligations under the related contracts and do not anticipate any material losses under these bonds or letters of credit 

mortgage commitments and forward sales 

in the normal course of business nvrm enters into contractual commitments to extend credit to our homebuyers with fixed expiration dates the commitments become effective when the borrowers “lockin” a specified interest rate within time frames established by us all mortgagors are evaluated for credit worthiness prior to the extension of the commitment market risk arises if interest rates move adversely between the time of the “lockin” of rates by the borrower and the sale date of the loan to a brokerdealer to mitigate the effect of the interest rate risk inherent in providing rate lock commitments to borrowers we enter into optional or mandatory delivery forward sale contracts to sell whole loans and mortgagebacked securities to brokerdealers the forward sale contracts lock in an interest rate and price for the sale of loans similar to the specific rate lock commitments we do not engage in speculative or trading derivative activities both the rate lock commitments to borrowers and the forward sale contracts to brokerdealers are undesignated derivatives and accordingly are marked to fair value through earnings at december 31 2019  we had 

contractual commitments to extend credit to borrowers aggregating 581065 and open forward delivery contracts aggregating 986041  which hedge both the rate lock commitments and closed loans held for sale see note 15 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of our fair value accounting 

contractual obligations 

our fixed noncancelable obligations as of december 31 2019  were as follows 



  

 

critical accounting policies 

general 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods we continually evaluate the estimates we use to prepare the consolidated financial statements and update those estimates as necessary in general our estimates are based on historical experience on information from third party professionals and other various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances actual results could differ materially from those estimates made by management 

homebuilding inventory 

the carrying value of inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market value cost of lots and completed and uncompleted housing units represent the accumulated actual cost of the units field construction supervisors’ salaries and related direct overhead expenses are included in inventory costs interest costs are not capitalized into inventory with the exception of land under development and joint venture investments as applicable see below upon settlement the cost of the unit is expensed on a specific identification basis cost of building materials is determined on a firstin firstout basis 

sold inventory is evaluated for impairment based on the contractual selling price compared to the total estimated cost to construct unsold inventory is evaluated for impairment by analyzing recent comparable sale prices within the applicable community compared to the costs incurred to date plus the expected costs to complete any calculated impairments are recorded immediately in cost of sales 

contract land deposits and land under development 

contract land deposits 

we purchase finished lots under lot purchase agreements that require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the contract the deposits are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percentage of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots 

we maintain an allowance for losses on contract land deposits that reflects our judgment of the present loss exposure in the existing contract land deposit portfolio at the end of the reporting period to analyze contract land deposit impairments we conduct a 

loss contingency analysis each quarter in addition to considering market and economic conditions we assess contract land deposit impairments on a communitybycommunity basis pursuant to the purchase contract terms analyzing as applicable current sales absorption levels recent sales’ direct profit the dollar differential between the contractual purchase price and the current market price for lots a developer’s performance a developer’s financial ability or willingness to reduce lot prices to current market prices if necessary and the contract’s default status by either us or the developer along with an analysis of the expected outcome of any such default 

our analysis is focused on whether we can sell houses at an acceptable margin and sales pace in a particular community in the current market with which we are faced because we do not own the finished lots on which we had placed a contract land deposit if the above analysis leads to a determination that we cannot sell homes at an acceptable margin and sales pace at the current contractual lot price we then determine whether we will elect to default under the contract forfeit our deposit and terminate the contract or whether we will attempt to restructure the lot purchase contract which may require us to forfeit the deposit to obtain contract concessions from a developer we also assess whether an impairment is present due to collectability issues resulting from a developer’s nonperformance because of financial or other conditions 

although we consider the allowance for losses on contract land deposits reflected on the december 31 2019 consolidated balance sheet to be adequate see note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included herein there can be no assurance that this allowance will prove to be adequate over time to cover losses due to unanticipated adverse changes in the economy or other events adversely affecting specific markets or the homebuilding industry 

land under development 

on a limited basis we directly acquire raw parcels of land already zoned for its intended use to develop into finished lots land under development includes the land acquisition costs direct improvement costs capitalized interest where applicable and real estate taxes 

land under development including the land under development held by our unconsolidated jvs and the related joint venture investments is reviewed for potential writedowns when impairment indicators are present in addition to considering market and economic conditions we assess land under development impairments on a communitybycommunity basis analyzing as applicable current sales absorption levels recent sales’ direct profit and the dollar differential between the projected fullydeveloped cost of the lots and the current market price for lots if indicators of impairment are present for a community we perform an analysis to determine if the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts and if so impairment charges are required to be recorded in an amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of such assets our determination of fair value is primarily based on discounting the estimated future cash flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams 

at december 31 2019  we had approximately 69200 in land under development in five separate communities in addition at december 31 2019  we had an aggregate investment totaling approximately 26700 in five separate jvs that controlled land under development none of the communities classified as land under development nor any of the undeveloped land held by the jvs had any indicators of impairment at december 31 2019  as such we do not believe that any of the land under development is impaired at this time however there can be no assurance that we will not incur impairment charges in the future due to unanticipated adverse changes in the economy or other events adversely affecting specific markets or the homebuilding industry 

warrantyproduct liability accruals 

we establish warranty and product liability reserves to provide for estimated future expenses as a result of construction and product defects product recalls and litigation incidental to our homebuilding business liability estimates are determined based on our judgment considering such factors as historical experience the likely current cost of corrective action manufacturers’ and subcontractors’ participation in sharing the cost of corrective action consultations with third party experts such as engineers and discussions with our general counsel and outside counsel retained to handle specific product liability cases although we consider the warranty and product liability accrual reflected on the december 31 2019 consolidated balance sheet to be adequate see note 14 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included herein there can be no assurance that this accrual will prove to be adequate over time to cover losses due to increased costs for material and labor the inability or refusal of manufacturers or subcontractors to financially participate in corrective action unanticipated adverse legal settlements or other unanticipated changes to the assumptions used to estimate the warranty and product liability accrual 

equitybased compensation expense 

we recognize equitybased compensation expense within our income statement for all sharebased payment arrangements which include nonqualified stock options to purchase shares of nvr common stock options and restricted share units rsus compensation expense is based on the grantdate fair value of the options and rsus granted and is recognized on a straightline basis over the requisite service period for the entire award from the date of grant through the period of the last separately vesting portion of the grant options and rsus which are subject to a performance condition are treated as a separate award from the “serviceonly” options and rsus and compensation expense is recognized when it becomes probable that the stated performance target will be achieved we calculate the fair value of our options which are nonpublicly traded using the blackscholes option 

pricing model the grant date fair value of the rsus is the closing price of our common stock on the day immediately preceding the date of grant the reversal of compensation expense previously recognized for grants forfeited is recorded in the period in which the forfeiture occurs 

as noted above we calculate the fair value of our options which are nonpublicly traded using the blackscholes optionpricing model while the blackscholes model is a widely accepted method to calculate the fair value of options its results are dependent on input variables two of which expected term and expected volatility are significantly dependent on management’s judgment we have concluded that our historical exercise experience is the best estimate of future exercise patterns to determine an option’s expected term to estimate expected volatility we analyze the historical volatility of our common stock over a period equal to the option’s expected term changes in management’s judgment of the expected term and the expected volatility could have a material effect on the grantdate fair value calculated and expensed within the income statement 

in addition when recognizing equitybased compensation cost related to “performance condition” option and rsu grants we are required to make a determination as to whether the performance conditions will be met prior to the completion of the actual performance period the performance metric is based on our return on capital performance during a specified three year period based on the date of option grant while we currently believe that this performance condition will be satisfied at the target level and are recognizing compensation expense related to such options and rsus accordingly our future expected activity levels could cause us to make a different determination resulting in a change to the compensation expense to be recognized related to performance condition option and rsu grants that would otherwise have been recognized to date 

although we believe that the compensation costs recognized in 2019 are representative of the cumulative ratable amortization of the grantdate fair value of unvested options and rsus outstanding changes to the estimated input values such as expected term and expected volatility and changes to the determination of whether performance condition grants will vest could produce widely different expense valuations and recognition 

mortgage repurchase reserve 

we originate several different loan products to our customers to finance the purchase of their home we sell all of the loans we originate into the secondary mortgage market on a servicing released basis typically within 30 days from closing all of the loans that we originate are underwritten to the standards and specifications of the ultimate investor those underwriting standards are typically equal to or more stringent than the underwriting standards required by fnma gnma fhlmc va and fha insofar as we underwrite our originated loans to those standards we bear no increased concentration of credit risk from the issuance of loans except in certain limited instances where repurchases or early payment default occur we employ a quality control department to ensure that our underwriting controls are effectively operating and further assess the underwriting function as part of our assessment of internal controls over financial reporting we maintain a reserve for losses on mortgage loans originated that reflects our judgment of the present loss exposure in the loans that we have originated and sold the reserve is calculated based on an analysis of historical experience and exposure although we consider the mortgage repurchase reserve reflected on the december 31 2019 consolidated balance sheet to be adequate see note 16 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included herein there can be no assurance that this reserve will prove to be adequate over time to cover losses due to unanticipated changes to the assumptions used to estimate the mortgage repurchase reserve 

impact of inflation changing prices and economic conditions 

see “risk factors” included in item 1a of this form 10k for a description of the impact of inflation changing prices and economic conditions on our business and our financial results see also the discussion of the current business environment in the overview section above 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

dollars in thousands 

market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates our market risk arises from interest rate risk inherent in our financial instruments and debt obligations interest rate risk results from the possibility that changes in interest rates will cause unfavorable changes in net income or in the value of interest ratesensitive assets liabilities and commitments lower interest rates tend to increase demand for mortgage loans for home purchasers while higher interest rates make it more difficult for potential borrowers to purchase residential properties and to qualify for mortgage loans we have no market rate sensitive instruments held for speculative or trading purposes 

our homebuilding segment is exposed to interest rate risk as it relates to its debt obligations in september 2012 we issued 600000 of senior notes the senior notes mature on september 15 2022 and bear interest at 395 payable semiannually in arrears on march 15 and september 15 changes to interest rates generally affect the fair value of fixedrate debt instruments but not earnings or cash flows we generally have no obligation to prepay the senior notes prior to maturity and therefore interest rate fluctuations should not have a significant impact on our fixedrate debt 

in july 2016 we entered into a credit agreement which provides for aggregate revolving loan commitments of 200000 under the credit agreement we may request increases of up to 300000 to the facility in the form of revolving loan commitments or term loans to the extent that new or existing lenders agree to provide additional revolving loan or term loan commitments the credit agreement provides for a 100000 sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit of which there was approximately 9700 outstanding at december 31 2019  and a 25000 sublimit for a swing line commitment borrowings under the credit agreement generally bear interest for base rate loans at a base rate equal to the highest of i a federal funds rate plus onehalf of one percent ii bank of america’s publicly announced “prime rate” and iii the eurodollar rate plus one percent plus the applicable rate which is based on our debt rating or for eurodollar rate loans at the eurodollar rate equal to libor plus the applicable rate at december 31 2019  there was no debt outstanding under the facility 

our mortgage banking segment is exposed to interest rate risk as it relates to its lending activities the mortgage banking segment originates mortgage loans which are sold through either optional or mandatory forward delivery contracts into the secondary markets all of the mortgage banking segment’s loan portfolio is held for sale and subject to forward sale commitments nvrm also sells all of its mortgages held for sale on a servicing released basis 

nvrm has available a mortgage repurchase agreement which as of december 31 2019 provided for loan repurchases up to 150000 the repurchase agreement is used to fund nvrm’s mortgage origination activities advances under the repurchase agreement carry a pricing rate based on the libor rate plus the libor margin as determined under the repurchase agreement provided that the pricing rate shall not be less than 185 at december 31 2019  there was no debt outstanding under the repurchase agreement 

the following table represents the contractual balances of our onbalance sheet financial instruments at the expected maturity dates as well as the fair values of those onbalance sheet financial instruments at december 31 2019  the expected maturity categories take into consideration the actual and anticipated amortization of principal and do not take into consideration the reinvestment of cash or the refinancing of existing indebtedness because we sell all of the mortgage loans we originate into the secondary markets we have made the assumption that the portfolio of mortgage loans held for sale will mature in the first year

we are one of the largest homebuilders in the united states we operate in multiple locations in fourteen states which are primarily in the eastern part of the country and in washington dc during 2018 approximately 23 and 8 of our home settlements occurred in the washington dc and baltimore md metropolitan areas respectively which accounted for approximately 30 and 10 respectively of our 2018 homebuilding revenues our homebuilding operations include the construction and sale of singlefamily detached homes townhomes and condominium buildings under three trade names ryan homes nvhomes and heartland homes our ryan homes product is marketed primarily to firsttime and firsttime moveup buyers ryan homes operates in thirtytwo metropolitan areas located in maryland virginia washington dc west virginia pennsylvania new york north carolina south carolina florida ohio new jersey delaware indiana illinois and tennessee our nvhomes and heartland homes products are marketed primarily to moveup and luxury buyers nvhomes operates in delaware and the washington dc baltimore md and philadelphia pa metropolitan areas heartland homes operates in the pittsburgh pa metropolitan area 

we generally do not engage in land development see discussion below of our land development activities instead we typically acquire finished building lots at market prices from various third party land developers pursuant to fixed price finished lot purchase agreements “lot purchase agreements” that require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the lot purchase agreements the deposits required under the lot purchase agreements are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and typically range up to 10 of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots 

we believe that our lot acquisition strategy avoids the financial requirements and risks associated with direct land ownership and land development we may at our option choose for any reason and at any time not to perform under these lot purchase agreements by delivering notice of our intent not to acquire the finished lots under contract our sole legal obligation and economic loss for failure to perform under these lot purchase agreements is limited to the amount of the deposit pursuant to the liquidated damage provision contained within the lot purchase agreements we do not have any financial guarantees or completion obligations and we typically do not guarantee lot purchases on a specific performance basis under these lot purchase agreements none of the creditors of any of the development entities with which we have entered these lot purchase agreements have recourse to our general credit we generally seek to maintain control over a supply of lots believed to be suitable to meet our fiveyear business plan 

in addition to constructing homes primarily on a presold basis and utilizing what we believe is a conservative lot acquisition strategy we focus on obtaining and maintaining a leading market position in each market we serve this strategy allows us to gain valuable efficiencies and competitive advantages in our markets which we believe contributes to minimizing the adverse effects of regional economic cycles and provides growth opportunities within these markets our continued success is contingent upon our ability to control an adequate supply of finished lots on which to build as a result in certain specific strategic circumstances we deviate from our historical lot acquisition strategy and engage in joint venture arrangements with land developers or directly acquire raw ground already zoned for its intended use for development once we acquire control of raw ground we determine whether to sell the raw parcel to a developer and enter into a lot purchase agreement with the developer to purchase the finished lots or hire a developer to develop the land on our behalf while joint venture arrangements and direct land development activity are not our preferred method of acquiring finished building lots we may enter into additional transactions in the future on a limited basis where there exists a compelling strategic or prudent financial reason to do so we expect however to continue to acquire substantially all of our finished lot inventory using lot purchase agreements with forfeitable deposits see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 of this form 10k for additional discussion of lots controlled in addition see notes 3 4 and 5 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information regarding lot purchase agreements joint ventures and land under development respectively 

in addition to building and selling homes we provide a number of mortgagerelated services through our mortgage banking operations through operations in each of our homebuilding markets nvrm originates mortgage loans almost exclusively for our homebuyers nvrm generates revenues primarily from origination fees gains on sales of loans and title fees nvrm sells all of the mortgage loans it closes into the secondary markets on a servicing released basis 

segment information for our homebuilding and mortgage banking businesses is included in note 2 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

homebuilding 

products 

we offer singlefamily detached homes townhomes and condominium buildings with many different basic home designs these home designs have a variety of elevations and numerous other options our homes combine traditional transitional cottage or urban exterior designs with contemporary interior designs and amenities generally include two to four bedrooms and range from approximately 1000 to 9500 finished square feet during 2018 the prices at which we settled homes ranged from approximately 130000 to 15 million and averaged 379700 during 2017 our average price of homes settled was 386900 

markets 

our four reportable homebuilding segments operate in the following geographic regions 



backlog 

backlog which represents homes sold but not yet settled with the customer totaled 8365 units and approximately 32 billion at december 31 2018 compared to 8531 units and approximately 33 billion at december 31 2017 backlog may be impacted by customer cancellations for various reasons that are beyond our control such as the customer’s failure to obtain mortgage financing inability to sell an existing home job loss or a variety of other reasons in any period a portion of the cancellations that we experience are related to new sales that occurred during the same period and a portion are related to sales that occurred in prior periods and therefore appeared in the opening backlog for the current period expressed as the total of all cancellations during the period as a percentage of gross sales during the period our cancellation rate was approximately 15 in 2018 14 in 2017 and 15 in 2016 additionally approximately 5 in 2018 and 6 in each of 2017 and 2016 of a reporting quarter’s opening backlog balance cancelled during the quarter we can provide no assurance that our historical cancellation rates are indicative of the actual cancellation rate that may occur in future periods other than those units that are cancelled we expect to settle substantially all of our december 31 2018 backlog during 2019 see “risk factors” in item 1a and “seasonality” in item 7 of this form 10k 

further discussion of settlements new orders and backlog activity by our homebuilding reportable segment for each of the last three years can be found in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 of this form 10k 

construction 

we utilize independent subcontractors under fixed price contracts to perform construction work on our homes we use many independent subcontractors in our various markets and we are not dependent on any single subcontractor or on a small number of subcontractors 

sales and marketing 

our preferred marketing method is for customers to visit a furnished model home featuring many builtin options and a landscaped lot the garages of these model homes are usually converted into temporary sales centers where alternative facades and floor plans are displayed and designs for other models are available for review sales representatives are compensated predominantly on a commission basis 

regulation 

we and our subcontractors must comply with various federal state and local zoning building environmental advertising and consumer credit statutes rules and regulations as well as other regulations and requirements in connection with our construction and sales activities all of these regulations have increased the cost to produce and market our products and in some instances have delayed our developers’ ability to deliver finished lots to us counties and cities in which we build homes have at times declared moratoriums on the issuance of building permits and imposed other restrictions in the areas in which sewage treatment facilities and other public facilities do not reach minimum standards in addition our homebuilding operations are regulated in certain areas by restrictive zoning and density requirements that limit the number of homes that can be built within the boundaries of a particular area to date restrictive zoning laws and the imposition of moratoriums have not had a material adverse effect on our construction activities 

competition and market factors 

the housing industry is highly competitive we compete with numerous homebuilders of varying size ranging from local to national in scope some of which have greater financial resources than we do we also face competition from the home resale market 

our homebuilding operations compete primarily on the basis of price location design quality service and reputation historically we have been one of the market leaders in each of the markets where we build homes 

the housing industry is cyclical and is affected by consumer confidence levels prevailing economic conditions and interest rates other factors that affect the housing industry and the demand for new homes include the availability and the cost of land labor and materials changes in consumer preferences demographic trends and the availability of mortgage finance programs see “risk factors” in item 1a of this form 10k for additional information regarding these risks 

we are dependent upon building material suppliers for a continuous flow of raw materials whenever possible we utilize standard products available from multiple sources in the past such raw materials have been generally available to us in adequate supply 

mortgage banking 

we provide a number of mortgage related services to our homebuilding customers through our mortgage banking operations our mortgage banking operations also include separate subsidiaries that broker title insurance and perform title searches in connection with mortgage loan closings for which they receive commissions and fees because nvrm originates mortgage loans almost exclusively for our homebuilding customers nvrm is dependent on our homebuilding segment in 2018 nvrm closed approximately 15100 loans with an aggregate principal amount of approximately 48 billion as compared to approximately 13100 loans with an aggregate principal amount of approximately 42 billion in 2017 

nvrm sells all of the mortgage loans it closes to investors in the secondary markets on a servicing released basis typically within 30 days from the loan closing nvrm is an approved sellerservicer for fannie mae “fnma” and freddie mac fhlmc mortgage loans and an approved sellerissuer of ginnie mae “gnma” department of veterans affairs “va” and federal housing administration “fha” mortgage loans 

regulation 

nvrm is subject to the rules and regulations of fnma gnma fhlmc va and fha these rules and regulations restrict certain activities of nvrm nvrm is currently eligible and expects to remain eligible to participate in such programs in addition nvrm is subject to regulation at the state and federal level including regulations issued by the consumer financial protection bureau the “cfpb” with respect to specific origination selling and servicing practices 

competition and market factors 

nvrm’s main competition comes from national regional and local mortgage bankers mortgage brokers credit unions and banks in each of these markets nvrm competes primarily on the basis of customer service variety of products offered interest rates offered prices of ancillary services and relative financing availability and costs 

pipeline 

nvrm’s mortgage loans in process that had not closed had an aggregate principal balance of approximately 22 billion as of both december 31 2018 and 2017 nvrm’s cancellation rate was approximately 32 31 and 34 in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively we can provide no assurance that our historical loan cancellation rates are indicative of the actual loan cancellation rate that may occur in future periods see “risk factors” in item 1a in this form 10k for additional information about factors that could increase our cancellation rate 

employees 

at december 31 2018 we employed approximately 5600 fulltime persons none of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement and we have never experienced a work stoppage we believe that our employee relations are good

 item 1a risk factors 

our business is affected by the risks generally incident to the residential construction business including but not limited to 

 all of these risks are discussed in detail below 

an economic downturn or decline in economic conditions could adversely affect our business and our results of operations 

demand for new homes is sensitive to economic changes driven by conditions such as employment levels job growth consumer confidence and interest rates if the housing industry suffers a downturn our sales may decline which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

interest rate movements inflation and other economic factors can negatively impact our business 

high rates of inflation generally affect the homebuilding industry adversely because of their adverse impact on interest rates high interest rates not only increase the cost of borrowed funds to homebuilders but also have a significant adverse effect on housing demand and on the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective purchasers we are also subject to potential volatility in the price of commodities that impact costs of materials used in our homebuilding business increases in prevailing interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

our financial results also are affected by the risks generally incident to our mortgage banking business including interest rate levels the impact of government regulation on mortgage loan originations and servicing and the need to issue forward commitments to fund and sell mortgage loans our homebuilding customers account for almost all of our mortgage banking business the volume of our continuing homebuilding operations therefore affects our mortgage banking business 

our mortgage banking business also is affected by interest rate fluctuations we also may experience marketing losses resulting from daily increases in interest rates to the extent we are unable to match interest rates and amounts on loans we have committed to originate with forward commitments from third parties to purchase such loans increases in interest rates may have a material adverse effect on our mortgage banking revenue profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

our operations may also be adversely affected by other economic factors within our markets such as negative changes in employment levels job growth wage growth consumer confidence and household formation and availability of mortgage financing one or all of which could result in reduced demand or price depression from current levels such negative trends could have a material adverse effect on homebuilding operations 

these factors and thus the homebuilding and mortgage banking businesses have at times in the past been cyclical in nature any downturn in the national economy or the local economies of the markets in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations in particular during 2018  approximately 23 and 8 of our home settlements occurred in the washington dc and baltimore md metropolitan areas respectively which accounted for approximately 30  and 10  respectively of our 2018  homebuilding revenues thus we are dependent to a significant extent on the economy and demand for housing in those areas 

because almost all of our customers require mortgage financing the availability of suitable mortgage financing could impair the affordability of our homes lower demand for our products and limit our ability to fully deliver our backlog 

our business and earnings depend on the ability of our potential customers to obtain mortgages for the purchase of our homes in addition many of our potential customers must sell their existing homes in order to buy a home from us the tightening of credit standards and the availability of suitable mortgage financing could prevent customers from buying our homes and could prevent buyers of our customers’ homes from obtaining mortgages they need to complete that purchase either of which could result in potential customers’ inability to buy a home from us if potential customers or the buyers of our customers’ current homes are not able to obtain suitable financing the result could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

if our ability to sell mortgages to investors is impaired we may be required to fund these commitments ourselves or we may not be able to originate loans at all 

our mortgage banking business sells all of the loans it originates into the secondary market usually within 30 days from the date of closing and has up to 150 million available under a repurchase agreement to fund mortgage closings see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – liquidity and capital resources” in item 7 of this form 10k for more information about the repurchase agreement in the event that disruptions to the secondary markets tighten or eliminate the available liquidity within the secondary markets for mortgage loans or the underwriting requirements by our secondary market investors continue to become more stringent our ability to sell future mortgages could decline and we could be required among other things to fund our commitments to our buyers with our own financial resources which is limited or require our home buyers to find another source of financing the result of such secondary market disruption could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

if the market value of our inventory or controlled lot position declines our profit could decrease and we may incur losses 

inventory risk can be substantial for homebuilders the market value of building lots and housing inventories can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing market conditions in addition inventory carrying costs can be significant and can result in losses in a poorly performing community or market we must continuously seek and make acquisitions of lots for expansion into new markets as well as for replacement and expansion within our current markets which we generally accomplish by entering into lot purchase agreements and paying forfeitable deposits under the lot purchase agreements to developers for the contractual right to acquire the lots in the event of adverse changes in economic market or community conditions we may cease further building activities in certain communities or restructure existing lot purchase agreements resulting in forfeiture of some or all of any remaining land contract deposit paid to the developer we may also have significant impairments of land under development the forfeiture of land contract deposits or inventory impairments may result in a loss that could have a material adverse effect on our profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

if the underwriting quality of our mortgage originations is found to be deficient our profit could decrease and we may incur losses 

we originate several different loan products to our customers to finance the purchase of their home we sell all of the loans we originate into the secondary mortgage market generally within 30 days from the date of closing all of the loans that we originate are underwritten to the standards and specifications of the ultimate investor insofar as we underwrite our originated loans to those standards we bear no increased concentration of credit risk from the issuance of loans except in certain limited instances where early payment default occurs in the event that a substantial number of the loans that we have originated fall into default and the investors to whom we sold the loans determine that we did not underwrite the loans in accordance with their requirements we could be required to repurchase the loans from the investor or indemnify the investor for any losses incurred any resulting losses could have a material adverse effect on our profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

we may be subject to claims on mortgage loans sold to third parties 

our mortgage banking operations may be responsible for losses associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to investors in the event of errors or omissions relating to certain representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements including representations as to underwriting standards the type of collateral the existence of private mortgage insurance and the validity of certain borrower representations in connection with the loan the resolution of claims related to alleged breaches of these representations and warranties and repurchase claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition cash flows and results of operations and could result in losses that exceed existing estimates and accruals because of the uncertainties inherent in 

estimating these matters there can be no assurance that any amounts reserved will be adequate or that any potential inadequacies will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our inability to secure and control an adequate inventory of lots could adversely impact our operations 

the results of our homebuilding operations depend upon our continuing ability to control an adequate number of homebuilding lots in desirable locations there can be no assurance that an adequate supply of building lots will continue to be available to us on terms similar to those available in the past or that we will not be required to devote a greater amount of capital to controlling building lots than we have historically an insufficient supply of building lots in one or more of our markets an inability of our developers to deliver finished lots in a timely fashion due to their inability to secure financing to fund development activities or for other reasons or our inability to purchase or finance building lots on reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

volatility in the credit and capital markets may impact our ability to access necessary financing 

if we require working capital greater than that provided by our operations and our credit facility we may be required to seek to increase the amount available under the facility or seek alternative financing which might not be available on terms that are favorable or acceptable if we are required to seek financing to fund our working capital requirements volatility in credit or capital markets may restrict our flexibility to access financing if we are at any time unsuccessful in obtaining sufficient capital to fund our planned homebuilding expenditures we may experience a substantial delay in the completion of homes then under construction or we may be unable to control or purchase finished building lots any delay could result in cost increases and could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

our mortgage banking operations depend in part on the availability cost and other terms of mortgage financing facilities and may be adversely affected by any shortage or increased cost of such financing additional or replacement financing might not be available on terms that are favorable or acceptable our mortgage banking operations are also dependent upon the securitization market for mortgagebacked securities and could be materially adversely affected by any fluctuation or downturn in such market 

our current indebtedness may impact our future operations 

our existing indebtedness contains restrictive covenants and any future indebtedness may also contain such covenants these covenants include or could include restrictions on our ability to create incur assume or guarantee secured debt enter into sale and leaseback transactions and conditions related to mergers andor the sale of assets substantial losses by us or other action or inaction by us or our subsidiaries could result in the violation of one or more of these covenants which could result in decreased liquidity or a default on our current or future indebtedness thereby having a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

government regulations and environmental matters could negatively affect our operations 

we are subject to various local state and federal statutes ordinances rules and regulations concerning zoning building design construction and similar matters including local regulations that impose restrictive zoning and density requirements in order to limit the number of homes that can eventually be built within the boundaries of a particular area these regulations may further increase the cost to produce and market our products in addition we have from time to time been subject to and may also be subject in the future to periodic delays in our homebuilding projects due to building moratoriums in the areas in which we operate or delays in receiving the necessary governmental approvals changes in regulations that restrict homebuilding activities in one or more of our principal markets could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

in addition new housing developments are often subject to various assessments or impact fees for schools parks streets highways and other public improvements the cost of these assessments is subject to substantial change and could cause increases in the construction cost of our homes which in turn could reduce our profitability 

we are also subject to a variety of local state and federal statutes ordinances rules and regulations concerning the protection of health and the environment we are subject to a variety of environmental conditions that can affect our business and our homebuilding projects the particular environmental laws that apply to any given homebuilding site vary greatly according to the location and environmental condition of the site and the present and former uses of the site and adjoining properties environmental laws and conditions may result in delays cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs or prohibit or severely restrict homebuilding activity in certain environmentally sensitive regions or areas thereby adversely affecting our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

increased regulation of the mortgage industry could harm our future sales and earnings 

the mortgage industry remains under intense scrutiny and continues to face increasing regulation at the federal state and local level potential changes to federal laws and regulations could have the effect of limiting the activities of fnma and fhlmc the entities that provide liquidity to the secondary mortgage market which could lead to increases in mortgage interest rates tighter 

underwriting requirements and fee restrictions and the increasingly complex regulatory environment may negatively impact our mortgage loan origination business in the form of lower demand decreased revenue and increased operating costs 

we are an approved sellerservicer of fnma and fhlmc mortgage loans and an approved sellerissuer of gnma va and fha mortgage loans and are subject to all of those agencies’ rules and regulations any significant impairment of our eligibility to sellservice these loans could have a material adverse impact on our mortgage operations in addition we are subject to regulation at the state and federal level with respect to specific origination selling and servicing practices including the real estate settlement and protection act adverse changes in governmental regulation may have a negative impact on our mortgage loan origination business 

we face competition in our homebuilding and mortgage banking operations 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive we compete with numerous homebuilders of varying size ranging from local to national in scope some of whom have greater financial resources than we do we face competition 

 our homebuilding operations compete primarily on the basis of price location design quality service and reputation 

the mortgage banking industry is also competitive our main competition comes from national regional and local mortgage bankers credit unions banks and mortgage brokers in each of these markets our mortgage banking operations compete primarily on the basis of customer service variety of products offered interest rates offered prices of ancillary services and relative financing availability and costs 

we might not be able to continue to compete successfully in our homebuilding or mortgage banking operations an inability to effectively compete may have an adverse impact on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

a shortage of building materials or labor or increases in materials or labor costs may adversely impact our operations 

the homebuilding business has from time to time experienced building material and labor shortages including fluctuating lumber prices and supply in addition strong construction market conditions could restrict the labor force available to our subcontractors and us in one or more of our markets significant increases in costs resulting from these shortages or delays in construction of homes could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

we rely on subcontractors to construct our homes the failure of our subcontractors to properly construct our homes may be costly 

we engage subcontractors to perform the actual construction of our homes despite our quality control efforts we may discover that our subcontractors have engaged in improper construction practices the occurrence of such events could require us to repair the homes in accordance with our standards and as required by law the cost of satisfying our legal obligations in these instances may be significant and we may be unable to recover the cost of repair from subcontractors suppliers and insurers 

product liability litigation and warranty claims may adversely impact our operations 

construction defect and home warranty claims are common and can represent a substantial risk for the homebuilding industry the cost of insuring against construction defect and product liability claims as well as the claims themselves can be high in addition insurance companies limit coverage offered to protect against these claims further restrictions on coverage availability or significant increases in premium costs or claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

we are subject to litigation proceedings that could harm our business if an unfavorable ruling were to occur 

from time to time we are involved in litigation and other legal proceedings relating to claims arising from our operations in the normal course of business as described in but not limited to item 3 “legal proceedings” of this form 10k we are currently subject to certain legal proceedings litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings may occur these or other litigation or legal proceedings could materially affect our ability to conduct our business in the manner that we expect or otherwise adversely affect us should an unfavorable ruling occur 

the loss of key personnel could adversely impact our business 

we rely on our key personnel to effectively operate and manage our business specifically our future success depends heavily on the performance of our senior management team our business may be adversely affected if we are unable to retain key personnel or attract qualified personnel to manage our business 

our failure to maintain the security of our electronic and other confidential information could expose us to liability and materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

privacy security and compliance concerns have continued to increase as technology has evolved as part of our normal business activities we collect and store certain confidential information including personal information of homebuyersborrowers and information about employees vendors and suppliers this information is entitled to protection under a number of federal and state laws we may share some of this information with vendors who assist us with certain aspects of our business particularly our mortgage and title businesses we have implemented systems and processes intended to secure our information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive confidential and personal data including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies additionally we have increased our monitoring capabilities to enhance early detection and rapid response to potential security anomalies these security measures may not be sufficient for all possible occurrences and may be vulnerable to hacking employee error malfeasance system error faulty password management or other irregularities further development and maintenance of these measures are costly and require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become increasingly sophisticated our failure to maintain the security of the data we are required to protect including via the penetration of our network security and the misappropriation of confidential and personal information could result in business disruption damage to our reputation financial obligations to third parties fines penalties regulatory proceedings and private litigation with potentially large costs and also in deterioration in customers’ confidence in us and other competitive disadvantages and thus could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

weatherrelated and other events beyond our control may adversely impact our operations 

extreme weather or other events such as significant snowfalls hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes forest fires floods terrorist attacks or war may affect our markets our operations and our profitability these events may impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or subcontractors and our housing inventories causing us material increases in costs or delays in construction of homes which could have a material adverse effect upon our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows

our lot acquisition strategy is predicated upon avoiding the financial requirements and risks associated with direct land ownership and development we generally do not engage in land development see discussion below of our land development activities instead we typically acquire finished lots at market prices from various third party land developers pursuant to lot purchase agreements these lot purchase agreements require deposits typically ranging up to 10 of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots in the form of cash or letters of credit that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the lot purchase agreement this strategy has allowed us to maximize inventory turnover which we believe enables us to minimize market risk and to operate with less capital thereby enhancing rates of return on equity and total capital 

in addition to constructing homes primarily on a presold basis and utilizing what we believe is a conservative lot acquisition strategy we focus on obtaining and maintaining a leading market position in each market we serve this strategy allows us to gain valuable efficiencies and competitive advantages in our markets which we believe contributes to minimizing the adverse effects of regional economic cycles and provides growth opportunities within these markets our continued success is contingent upon our ability to control an adequate supply of finished lots on which to build 

in limited specific strategic circumstances we deviate from our historical lot acquisition strategy and engage in joint venture arrangements with land developers or directly acquire raw ground already zoned for its intended use for development once we acquire control of raw ground we determine whether to sell the raw parcel to a developer and enter into a lot purchase agreement with the developer to purchase the finished lots or to hire a developer to develop the land on our behalf while joint venture arrangements and direct land development activity are not our preferred method of acquiring finished building lots we may enter into additional transactions in the future on a limited basis where there exists a compelling strategic or prudent financial reason to do so we expect however to continue to acquire substantially all of our finished lot inventory using lot purchase agreements with forfeitable deposits 

as of december 31 2018  we controlled lots as described below 

lot purchase agreements 

we controlled approximately 95750  lots under lot purchase agreements with third parties through deposits in cash and letters of credit totaling approximately 420900  and 3800  respectively included in the number of controlled lots are approximately 4250 lots for which we have recorded a contract land deposit impairment reserve of approximately 29200 as of december 31 2018  

joint venture limited liability corporations “jvs” 

we had an aggregate investment totaling approximately 29400  in six  jvs expected to produce approximately 6800  lots of the lots to be produced by the jvs approximately 3450  lots were controlled by us and approximately 3350  lots were either under contract with unrelated parties or currently not under contract 

land under development 

we directly owned three separate raw land parcels zoned for their intended use with a current cost basis including development costs of approximately 38900  that we intend to develop into approximately 500  finished lots we had additional funding commitments of approximately 7300  under a joint development agreement related to one parcel a portion of which we expect will be offset by development credits of approximately 4600  

see notes 3 4 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information regarding lot purchase agreements jvs and land under development respectively 

raw land purchase agreements 

in addition to the lots we currently control as discussed above we have certain properties under contract with land owners that are expected to yield approximately 7500  lots some of these properties may require rezoning or other approvals to achieve the expected yield these properties are controlled with cash deposits and letters of credit totaling approximately 4500  and 150  respectively as of december 31 2018  of which approximately 1700  is refundable if we do not perform under the contract we generally expect to assign the raw land contracts to a land developer and simultaneously enter into a lot purchase agreement with the assignee if the project is determined to be feasible 

current business environment and key financial results 

during 2018  general market conditions were favorably impacted by low unemployment and improved consumer confidence leading to strong demand for new homes in the first half of 2018 however during the second half of the year demand for new homes softened due to affordability issues in part attributable to rising interest rates and some market uncertainty we expect to experience pricing and sales pressure in future quarters due to higher interest rates and a competitive market environment which includes rising new home inventory levels 

our consolidated revenues for the year ended december 31 2018  totaled 7163674  an increase of 14 from 6305840  in 2017  our net income for 2018  was 797197  or 19480  per diluted share increases of 48 and 54 compared to 2017  net income and diluted earnings per share respectively our homebuilding gross profit margin percentage decreased to 187 in 2018  from 192 in 2017  new orders net of cancellations “new orders” during 2018  were 18281 an increase of 4 from 2017  while our average new order sales price decreased 2 to 3763 in 2018  our backlog of homes sold but not yet settled with the customer as of december 31 2018  decreased on a unit basis by 2 to 8365 units and decreased on a dollar basis by 4 to 3152873 when compared to december 31 2017  

we believe that the strength in demand for new homes is dependent upon sustained economic growth driven by favorable unemployment levels and continued improvements in wage growth and household formation we expect to continue to face gross profit margin pressure which will be impacted by modest pricing power and our ability to manage land and construction costs we also expect to face pressure on mortgage banking profit due to the competitive pricing pressures in the mortgage market we believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities that may arise from future economic and homebuilding market volatility due to the strength of our balance sheet 

homebuilding operations 

the following table summarizes the results of our consolidated homebuilding operations and certain operating activity for each of the last three years 



consolidated homebuilding 

2018  versus 2017 

homebuilding revenues increased 13  in 2018  compared to 2017  as a result of a 16  increase in the number of units settled offset by a 2 decrease in the average settlement price year over year the increase in the number of units settled was primarily attributable to a 24 higher backlog unit balance entering 2018  compared to the backlog unit balance entering 2017  offset partially by a lower backlog turnover rate year over year the decrease in the average settlement price was attributable to a 2 lower average 

price of units in backlog entering 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 and to a 2 decrease in the average sales price of new orders in the first six months of 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 

gross profit margin percentage in 2018  decreased to 187  from 192  in 2017  due primarily to higher lot and certain material costs   

the number of new orders increased 4  while the average sales price of new orders decreased 2  in 2018  when compared to 2017  new orders increased primarily due to more favorable market conditions in the first half of 2018  compared to the same period in 2017  which led to higher community absorption rates year over year new home demand began to soften in the second half of 2018 due to affordability issues in part attributable to rising mortgage interest rates which led to lower sales in each of our reporting segments in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 and an overall decrease in new orders of 11 quarter over quarter the decrease in the average sales price of new orders was attributable to a relative shift in new orders to lower price product and lower price markets 

selling general and administrative sga expenses in 2018  increased by 9  compared to 2017  primarily due to an approximate 28600 increase in equitybased compensation due to the equity grants in the second quarter of 2018 as further discussed in note 12 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and an increase in personnel costs sga expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to 61  in 2018  from 64  in 2017  primarily due to the 13  increase in revenues 

backlog units and dollars were 8365  units and 3152873 respectively as of december 31 2018  compared to 8531  units and 3277888 respectively as of december 31 2017 the 2  decrease in backlog units and dollars was primarily attributable to a 4 decrease in new orders and a 2 decrease in the average new order sales price for the sixmonth period ended december 31 2018  compared to the same period in 2017  

backlog may be impacted by customer cancellations for various reasons that are beyond our control such as failure to obtain mortgage financing inability to sell an existing home job loss or a variety of other reasons in any period a portion of the cancellations that we experience are related to new orders that occurred during the same period and a portion are related to new orders that occurred in prior periods and therefore appeared in the beginning backlog for the current period expressed as the total of all cancellations during the period as a percentage of gross new orders during the period our cancellation rate was approximately 15  in 2018  approximately 14  in 2017  and approximately 15  in 2016  additionally approximately 5 in 2018  and 6 in each 2017  and 2016  of a reporting quarter’s opening backlog cancelled during the quarter we can provide no assurance that our historical cancellation rates are indicative of the actual cancellation rate that may occur in future years other than those units that are cancelled we expect to settle substantially all of our december 31 2018  backlog during 2019 see “risk factors” in item 1a of this form 10k 

the backlog turnover rate is impacted by various factors including but not limited to changes in new order activity internal production capacity external subcontractor capacity and other external factors over which we do not exercise control 

2017 versus 2016 

homebuilding revenues increased 8 in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily as a result of a 7 increase in the number of units settled year over year the increase in the number of units settled was primarily attributable to an 11 higher backlog unit balance entering 2017 compared to the backlog unit balance entering 2016 offset partially by a lower backlog turnover rate year over year 

gross profit margin percentage in 2017 increased to 192 from 175 in 2016 due primarily to modest improvement in pricing moderating construction costs and the increase in the number of units settled which allowed us to better leverage certain operating costs 

the number of new orders increased 13 while the average sales price of new orders decreased 1 in 2017 when compared to 2016 new orders increased in each of our market segments due to more favorable market conditions in 2017 compared to 2016 which led to higher community absorption rates year over year 

sga expenses in 2017 increased by 3 compared to 2016 but as a percentage of revenue decreased to 64 in 2017 from 67 in 2016 sga expenses as a percentage of revenue were favorably impacted by the 8 increase in revenues 

backlog units and dollars were 8531 units and 3277888 respectively as of december 31 2017 compared to 6884 units and 2704277 respectively as of december 31 2016 the 24 increase in backlog units was primarily attributable to a 19 increase in new orders for the sixmonth period ended december 31 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 backlog dollars were favorably impacted by the increase in backlog units 

reportable homebuilding segments 

homebuilding profit before tax includes all revenues and income generated from the sale of homes less the cost of homes sold sga expenses and a corporate capital allocation charge determined by corporate management the corporate capital allocation charge eliminates in consolidation and is based on the segment’s average net assets employed the corporate capital allocation charged to the operating segment allows the chief operating decision maker to determine whether the operating segment’s results are providing the desired rate of return after covering our cost of capital 

we record charges on contract land deposits when we determine that it is probable that recovery of the deposit is impaired for segment reporting purposes impairments on contract land deposits are generally charged to the operating segment upon the termination of a lot purchase agreement with the developer or the restructuring of a lot purchase agreement resulting in the forfeiture of the deposit for presentation purposes below the contract land deposit reserve at december 31 2018 and 2017 has been allocated to the reportable segments for the respective years to show contract land deposits on a net basis the net contract land deposit balances below also include approximately 3900 and 2000 at december 31 2018 and 2017 respectively of letters of credit issued as deposits in lieu of cash

homebuilding segment reconciliations to consolidated homebuilding operations 

in addition to the corporate capital allocation and contract land deposit impairments discussed above the other reconciling items between homebuilding segment profit and homebuilding consolidated profit before tax include unallocated corporate overhead which includes all management incentive compensation equitybased compensation expense consolidation adjustments and external corporate interest expense our overhead functions such as accounting treasury and human resources are centrally performed and the costs are not allocated to our operating segments consolidation adjustments consist of such items to convert the reportable segments’ results which are predominantly maintained on a cash basis to a full accrual basis for external financial statement presentation purposes and are not allocated to our operating segments external corporate interest expense is primarily comprised of interest charges on our 395 senior notes due 2022 the “senior notes” and is not charged to the operating segments because the charges are included in the corporate capital allocation discussed above 



  



  

 

mortgage banking segment 

we conduct our mortgage banking activity through nvrm a wholly owned subsidiary nvrm focuses almost exclusively on serving the homebuilding segment customer base the following table summarizes the results of our mortgage banking operations and certain statistical data for each of the last three years 



2018  versus 2017 

loan closing volume in 2018  increased by approximately 599900 or 14 from 2017  the increase was primarily attributable to a 15 increase in the number of loans closed year over year due primarily to the aforementioned increase in the homebuilding segment’s number of settlements in 2018  as compared to 2017  

segment profit in 2018  increased by approximately 19500 or 26 from 2017  the increase in segment profit was primarily attributable to an increase in mortgage banking fees partially offset by an increase in general and administrative expenses mortgage banking fees increased by approximately 29100 or 22 resulting from the aforementioned increase in loan closing volume and an increase in secondary marketing gains on sales of loans general and administrative expenses increased by approximately 13900 due primarily to an increase in compensation costs as a result of an increase in average headcount compared to 2017  

2017  versus 2016 

loan closing volume in 2017 increased by approximately 276900 or 7 from 2016 the increase was primarily attributable to a 6 increase in the number of loans closed year over year due primarily to an increase in the homebuilding segment’s number of settlements in 2017 as compared to 2016 

segment profit in 2017 increased by approximately 10200 or 16 from 2016 the increase in segment profit was primarily attributable to an increase in mortgage banking fees partially offset by an increase in general and administrative expenses mortgage banking fees increased by approximately 17000 or 15 resulting from an increase in loan closing volume and an increase in secondary marketing gains on sales of loans general and administrative expenses increased by approximately 7400 due primarily to an increase in compensation costs as a result of an increase in average headcount compared to 2016 

mortgage banking – other 

we sell all of the loans we originate into the secondary mortgage market insofar as we underwrite our originated loans to the standards and specifications of the ultimate investor we have no further financial obligations from the issuance of loans except in certain limited instances where early payment default occurs those underwriting standards are typically equal to or more stringent than the underwriting standards required by fnma fhlmc va and fha because we sell all of our loans and do not service them there is often a substantial delay between the time that a loan goes into default and the time that the investor requests us to reimburse them for losses incurred because of the default we believe that all of the loans that we originate are underwritten to the standards and 

specifications of the ultimate investor to whom we sell our originated loans we employ a quality control department to ensure that our underwriting controls are effective and further assess the underwriting function as part of our assessment of internal controls over financial reporting 

we maintain a reserve for losses on mortgage loans originated that reflects our judgment of the present loss exposure from the loans that we have originated and sold the reserve is calculated based on an analysis of historical experience and exposure at december 31 2018  we had a repurchase reserve of approximately 15600  although we consider the repurchase reserve reflected on the december 31 2018  consolidated balance sheet to be adequate there can be no assurance that this reserve will prove to be adequate to cover losses on loans previously originated 

nvrm is dependent on our homebuilding operation’s customers for business if new orders and selling prices of the homebuilding segment decline nvrm’s operations will also be adversely affected in addition nvrm’s operating results may be adversely affected in future periods due to tightening and volatility of the credit markets changes in investor funding times increased regulation of mortgage lending practices and increased competition in the mortgage market 

seasonality 

we generally have higher new order activity in the first half of the year and higher home settlements revenues and net income in the second half of the year 

effective tax rate 

our consolidated effective tax rate in 2018  2017  and 2016  was 1694  3653  and 3573  respectively the lower effective tax rate in 2018  resulted primarily from the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act the act in december 2017 which had the following impacts on comparability between periods 

 excluding the charge related to the net deferred tax asset remeasurement our effective tax rate in 2017 would have been 2913 

additionally our effective tax rates in 2018 and 2017 were favorably impacted by the recognition of an income tax benefit related to excess tax benefits from stock option exercises of 77478 and 58681 respectively excess tax benefits in 2016 were recorded to additional paidincapital within shareholders equity on the consolidated balance sheet we expect continued rate volatility in future years attributable to the recognition of excess tax benefits from equity plan activity and distributions from the deferred compensation plans 

the act eliminated the performancebased compensation exception from section 162m the act included a grandfathering provision for compensation pursuant to a written binding contract which was in effect on november 2 2017 and which was not modified in any material respect after such date we believe that our outstanding equity grants and amounts in the deferred compensation plans as of december 31 2017 are in compliance with the grandfathering provision of the act and thus will remain deductible to the extent they are considered performancebased compensation

the repurchase agreement contains various affirmative and negative covenants the negative covenants include among others certain limitations on transactions involving acquisitions mergers the incurrence of debt sale of assets and creation of liens upon any of its mortgage notes additional covenants include i a tangible net worth requirement ii a minimum liquidity requirement iii a minimum net income requirement and iv a maximum leverage ratio requirement we were in compliance with all covenants under the repurchase agreement at december 31 2018  at december 31 2018  there was no debt outstanding under the repurchase agreement and there were no borrowing base limitations 

equity repurchases 

in addition to funding growth in our homebuilding and mortgage banking operations we historically have used a substantial portion of our excess liquidity to repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock in open market and privately negotiated transactions this ongoing repurchase activity is conducted pursuant to publicly announced board authorizations and is typically executed in accordance with the safeharbor provisions of rule 10b18 promulgated under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended in addition the board resolutions authorizing us to repurchase shares of our common stock specifically prohibit us from purchasing shares from our officers directors profit sharing plan trust or employee stock ownership plan trust the repurchase program assists us in accomplishing our primary objective creating increases in shareholder value see “market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities” in item 5 of this form 10k for disclosure of amounts repurchased during the fourth quarter of 2018  for the year ended december 31 2018  we repurchased 300815 shares of our common stock at an aggregate purchase price of 846134  as of december 31 2018  we had 415558 available under board approved repurchase authorizations 

cash flows 

as a result of our adoption of asu 201615 and asu 201618 in 2018 we have retrospectively adjusted the presentation of our prior year statements of cash flows to conform with current year presentation asu 201615 resulted in the reclassification of a portion of the distributions received from our unconsolidated joint ventures between operating and investing activities asu 201618 requires that the statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash cash equivalents and restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents as a result our beginningofperiod and endofperiod cash balances presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows were retrospectively adjusted to include restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents see note 1 for further discussion of the impact of the adoption of asu 201615 and asu 201618 

for the year ended december 31 2018  cash and cash equivalents increased by 42691  net cash provided by operating activities was 723126  due primarily to cash provided by earnings in 2018  and net proceeds of 17384  from mortgage loan activity cash was primarily used to fund the increase in contract land deposits of 30863 and the decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of 30713 net cash used in investing activities in 2018  of 8177  was attributable primarily to cash used for purchases of property plant and equipment of 19665  offset partially by the receipt of capital distributions from our unconsolidated jvs totaling 10515  net cash used in financing activities of 672258  was primarily impacted by our repurchase of 300815 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of 846134  under our ongoing common stock repurchase program as discussed above offset partially by 174110  in proceeds from stock option exercises 

for the year ended december 31 2017 cash and cash equivalents increased by 273520 net cash provided by operating activities was 570354 due primarily to cash provided by earnings in 2017 and net proceeds of 104848 from mortgage loan activity cash was primarily used to fund the increase in homebuilding inventory of 154099 which is attributable to an increase in the number of homes under construction at december 31 2017 compared to december 31 2016 net cash used in investing activities in 2017 of 15193 was attributable to cash used for purchases of property plant and equipment of 20269 and investments in unconsolidated jvs of 3800 offset partially by the receipt of capital distributions from our unconsolidated jvs totaling 8029 net cash used in financing activities of 281641 was primarily impacted by our repurchase of 166520 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of 422166 under our ongoing common stock repurchase program as discussed above offset partially by 140525 in proceeds from stock option exercises 

for the year ended december 31 2016 cash and cash equivalents decreased by 34757 net cash provided by operating activities was 392988 cash provided by earnings in 2016 was used to fund the increase in homebuilding inventory of 85194 as a result of an increase in units under construction at december 31 2016 compared to december 31 2015 and the increase of 32280 in contract land deposits cash was favorably impacted by an increase of 58532 in accounts payable and accrued expenses associated with the increase in homebuilding inventory and net proceeds of 49981 from mortgage loan activity net cash used in investing activities in 2016 of 10350 primarily included cash used for purchases of property plant and equipment of 22369 offset partially by the receipt of capital distributions from our unconsolidated jvs totaling 11672 net cash used in financing activities of 417395 was primarily impacted by our repurchase of 280288 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of 455351 under our ongoing common stock repurchase program as discussed above offset partially by 38106 in proceeds from stock option exercises 

at december 31 2018  and 2017  the homebuilding segment had restricted cash of 16982  and 19438  respectively restricted cash in each year was attributable to customer deposits for certain home sales 

we believe that our current cash holdings cash generated from operations and cash available under our shortterm unsecured credit agreement revolving mortgage repurchase facility and the public debt and equity markets will be sufficient to satisfy near and long term cash requirements for working capital and debt service in both our homebuilding and mortgage banking operations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

lot acquisition strategy 

we generally do not engage in land development instead we typically acquire finished building lots at market prices from various land developers under lot purchase agreements that require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the agreement the deposits required under the lot purchase agreements are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percentage typically ranging up to 10 of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots 

we believe that our lot acquisition strategy reduces the financial requirements and risks associated with direct land ownership and land development we may at our option choose for any reason and at any time not to perform under these lot purchase agreements by delivering notice of our intent not to acquire the finished lots under contract our sole legal obligation and economic loss for failure to perform under these purchase agreements is limited to the amount of the deposit pursuant to the liquidated damage provision contained in the lot purchase agreements we do not have any financial guarantees or completion obligations and we typically do not guarantee lot purchases on a specific performance basis under these lot purchase agreements 

at december 31 2018  we controlled approximately 99700  lots through lot purchase agreements jvs and land under development with an aggregate purchase price of approximately 9400000 these lots are controlled by making or committing to make deposits of approximately 618300 in the form of cash and letters of credit our entire risk of loss pertaining to the aggregate purchase price contractual commitment resulting from our nonperformance under the contracts is limited to 420900  in deposits paid and 3800  in letters of credit issued as of december 31 2018  plus approximately 193600 related to deposits to be paid subsequent to december 31 2018  assuming that contractual development milestones are met by the developers and we exercise our option and approximately 1500 in specific performance obligations see contractual obligations  section below as of december 31 2018  we had recorded an impairment valuation allowance of approximately 29200  related to certain cash deposits currently outstanding additionally as of december 31 2018  we had funding commitments totaling 5000  to three of our jvs and approximately 7300  under a joint development agreement related to our land under development a portion of which we expect will be offset by development credits of approximately 4600  

in addition we have certain properties under contract with land owners that are expected to yield approximately 7500  lots which are not included in our number of total lots controlled above some of these properties may require rezoning or other approvals to achieve the expected yield these properties are controlled with cash deposits and letters of credit of approximately 4500  and 150  respectively as of december 31 2018  of which approximately 1700  is refundable if we do not perform under the contract and the remainder is at risk of loss we generally expect to assign the raw land contracts to a land developer and simultaneously enter into a lot purchase agreement with the assignee if the project is determined to be feasible please refer to note 1 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of the contract land deposits and note 3 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of our lot acquisition strategy in relation to our accounting for variable interest entities 

bonds and letters of credit 

we enter into bond or letter of credit arrangements with local municipalities government agencies or land developers to collateralize our obligations under various contracts we had approximately 37600 of contingent obligations under such agreements as of december 31 2018  inclusive of the 3800  of lot acquisition deposits in the form of letters of credit discussed above we believe we will fulfill our obligations under the related contracts and do not anticipate any material losses under these bonds or letters of credit 

mortgage commitments and forward sales 

in the normal course of business nvrm enters into contractual commitments to extend credit to buyers of singlefamily homes with fixed expiration dates the commitments become effective when the borrowers “lockin” a specified interest rate within time frames established by us all mortgagors are evaluated for credit worthiness prior to the extension of the commitment market risk arises if interest rates move adversely between the time of the “lockin” of rates by the borrower and the sale date of the loan to a brokerdealer to mitigate the effect of the interest rate risk inherent in providing rate lock commitments to borrowers we enter into optional or mandatory delivery forward sale contracts to sell whole loans and mortgagebacked securities to brokerdealers the forward sale contracts lock in an interest rate and price for the sale of loans similar to the specific rate lock commitments we do not engage in speculative or trading derivative activities both the rate lock commitments to borrowers and the forward sale contracts to brokerdealers are undesignated derivatives and accordingly are marked to fair value through earnings at december 31 2018  we had contractual commitments to extend credit to borrowers aggregating 682152  and open forward delivery contracts aggregating 1089923  which hedge both the rate lock commitments and closed loans held for sale see note 14 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of our fair value accounting 

contractual obligations 

our fixed noncancelable obligations as of december 31 2018  were as follows 



  



development milestones that must be met we are unable to accurately estimate the portion of the deposit obligation that will be made within one year and that portion that will be made within one to three years 

 

critical accounting policies 

general 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods we continually evaluate the estimates we use to prepare the consolidated financial statements and update those estimates as necessary in general our estimates are based on historical experience on information from third party professionals and other various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances actual results could differ materially from those estimates made by management 

homebuilding inventory 

the carrying value of inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market value cost of lots and completed and uncompleted housing units represent the accumulated actual cost of the units field construction supervisors’ salaries and related direct overhead expenses are included in inventory costs interest costs are not capitalized into inventory with the exception of land under development and joint venture investments as applicable see below upon settlement the cost of the unit is expensed on a specific identification basis cost of building materials is determined on a firstin firstout basis 

sold inventory is evaluated for impairment based on the contractual selling price compared to the total estimated cost to construct unsold inventory is evaluated for impairment by analyzing recent comparable sale prices within the applicable community compared to the costs incurred to date plus the expected costs to complete any calculated impairments are recorded immediately in cost of sales 

contract land deposits and land under development 

contract land deposits 

we purchase finished lots under lot purchase agreements that require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the contract the deposits are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percentage of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots 

we maintain an allowance for losses on contract land deposits that reflects our judgment of the present loss exposure in the existing contract land deposit portfolio at the end of the reporting period to analyze contract land deposit impairments we conduct a loss contingency analysis each quarter in addition to considering market and economic conditions we assess contract land deposit impairments on a communitybycommunity basis pursuant to the purchase contract terms analyzing as applicable current sales absorption levels recent sales’ direct profit the dollar differential between the contractual purchase price and the current market price for lots a developer’s financial stability a developer’s financial ability or willingness to reduce lot prices to current market prices if necessary and the contract’s default status by either us or the developer along with an analysis of the expected outcome of any such default 

our analysis is focused on whether we can sell houses at an acceptable margin and sales pace in a particular community in the current market with which we are faced because we do not own the finished lots on which we had placed a contract land deposit if the above analysis leads to a determination that we cannot sell homes at an acceptable margin and sales pace at the current contractual lot price we then determine whether we will elect to default under the contract forfeit our deposit and terminate the contract or whether we will attempt to restructure the lot purchase contract which may require us to forfeit the deposit to obtain contract concessions from a developer we also assess whether an impairment is present due to collectability issues resulting from a developer’s nonperformance because of financial or other conditions 

although we consider the allowance for losses on contract land deposits reflected on the december 31 2018  consolidated balance sheet to be adequate see note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included herein there can be no assurance that this allowance will prove to be adequate over time to cover losses due to unanticipated adverse changes in the economy or other events adversely affecting specific markets or the homebuilding industry 

land under development 

on a limited basis we directly acquire raw parcels of land already zoned for its intended use to develop into finished lots land under development includes the land acquisition costs direct improvement costs capitalized interest where applicable and real estate taxes 

land under development including the land under development held by our unconsolidated jvs and the related joint venture investments is reviewed for potential writedowns when impairment indicators are present in addition to considering market and economic conditions we assess land under development impairments on a communitybycommunity basis analyzing as applicable current sales absorption levels recent sales’ direct profit and the dollar differential between the projected fullydeveloped cost of the lots and the current market price for lots if indicators of impairment are present for a community we perform an analysis to determine if the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts and if so impairment charges are required to be recorded in an amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of such assets our determination of fair value is primarily based on discounting the estimated future cash flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams 

at december 31 2018  we had approximately 38900  in land under development in three  separate communities in addition at december 31 2018  we had an aggregate investment totaling approximately 29400  in six  separate jvs that controlled land under development during 2018  the company recognized an impairment of approximately 7400  including approximately 760  of capitalized interest related to one of our jvs none of the communities classified as land under development nor any of the undeveloped land held by the jvs had any indicators of impairment at december 31 2018  as such we do not believe that any of the land under development is impaired at this time however there can be no assurance that we will not incur impairment charges in the future due to unanticipated adverse changes in the economy or other events adversely affecting specific markets or the homebuilding industry 

warrantyproduct liability accruals 

we establish warranty and product liability reserves to provide for estimated future expenses as a result of construction and product defects product recalls and litigation incidental to our homebuilding business liability estimates are determined based on our judgment considering such factors as historical experience the likely current cost of corrective action manufacturers’ and subcontractors’ participation in sharing the cost of corrective action consultations with third party experts such as engineers and discussions with our general counsel and outside counsel retained to handle specific product liability cases although we consider the warranty and product liability accrual reflected on the december 31 2018  consolidated balance sheet to be adequate see note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included herein there can be no assurance that this accrual will prove to be adequate over time to cover losses due to increased costs for material and labor the inability or refusal of manufacturers or subcontractors to financially participate in corrective action unanticipated adverse legal settlements or other unanticipated changes to the assumptions used to estimate the warranty and product liability accrual 

equitybased compensation expense 

we recognize equitybased compensation expense within our income statement for all sharebased payment arrangements which includes nonqualified stock options to purchase shares of nvr common stock options and restricted share units rsus compensation expense is based on the grantdate fair value of the options and rsus granted and is recognized on a straightline basis over the requisite service period for the entire award from the date of grant through the period of the last separately vesting portion of the grant options and rsus which are subject to a performance condition are treated as a separate award from the “serviceonly” options and rsus and compensation expense is recognized when it becomes probable that the stated performance target will be achieved we calculate the fair value of our options which are nonpublicly traded using the blackscholes optionpricing model the grant date fair value of the rsus is the closing price of our common stock on the day immediately preceding the date of grant the reversal of compensation expense previously recognized for grants forfeited is recorded in the period in which the forfeiture occurs 

as noted above we calculate the fair value of our options which are nonpublicly traded using the blackscholes optionpricing model while the blackscholes model is a widely accepted method to calculate the fair value of options its results are dependent on input variables two of which expected term and expected volatility are significantly dependent on management’s judgment we have concluded that our historical exercise experience is the best estimate of future exercise patterns to determine an option’s expected term to estimate expected volatility we analyze the historical volatility of our common stock over a period equal to the option’s expected term changes in management’s judgment of the expected term and the expected volatility could have a material effect on the grantdate fair value calculated and expensed within the income statement 

in addition when recognizing equitybased compensation cost related to “performance condition” option and rsu grants we are required to make a determination as to whether the performance conditions will be met prior to the completion of the actual performance period the performance metric is based on our return on capital performance during a specified three year period based on the date of option grant while we currently believe that this performance condition will be satisfied at the target level and are recognizing compensation expense related to such options and rsus accordingly our future expected activity levels could cause us to make a different determination resulting in a change to the compensation expense to be recognized related to performance condition option and rsu grants that would otherwise have been recognized to date 

although we believe that the compensation costs recognized in 2018  are representative of the cumulative ratable amortization of the grantdate fair value of unvested options and rsus outstanding changes to the estimated input values such as expected term 

and expected volatility and changes to the determination of whether performance condition grants will vest could produce widely different expense valuations and recognition 

mortgage repurchase reserve 

we originate several different loan products to our customers to finance the purchase of their home we sell all of the loans we originate into the secondary mortgage market on a servicing released basis typically within 30 days from closing all of the loans that we originate are underwritten to the standards and specifications of the ultimate investor those underwriting standards are typically equal to or more stringent than the underwriting standards required by fnma fhlmc va and fha insofar as we underwrite our originated loans to those standards we bear no increased concentration of credit risk from the issuance of loans except in certain limited instances where early payment default occurs we employ a quality control department to ensure that our underwriting controls are effectively operating and further assess the underwriting function as part of our assessment of internal controls over financial reporting we maintain a reserve for losses on mortgage loans originated that reflects our judgment of the present loss exposure in the loans that we have originated and sold the reserve is calculated based on an analysis of historical experience and exposure although we consider the mortgage repurchase reserve reflected on the december 31 2018  consolidated balance sheet to be adequate see note 15 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included herein there can be no assurance that this reserve will prove to be adequate over time to cover losses due to unanticipated changes to the assumptions used to estimate the mortgage repurchase reserve 

impact of inflation changing prices and economic conditions 

see “risk factors” included in item 1a of this form 10k for a description of the impact of inflation changing prices and economic conditions on our business and our financial results see also the discussion of the current business environment in the overview  section above 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

dollars in thousands 

market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates our market risk arises from interest rate risk inherent in our financial instruments and debt obligations interest rate risk results from the possibility that changes in interest rates will cause unfavorable changes in net income or in the value of interest ratesensitive assets liabilities and commitments lower interest rates tend to increase demand for mortgage loans for home purchasers while higher interest rates make it more difficult for potential borrowers to purchase residential properties and to qualify for mortgage loans we have no market rate sensitive instruments held for speculative or trading purposes 

our homebuilding segment is exposed to interest rate risk as it relates to its debt obligations in september 2012 we issued 600000 of senior notes the senior notes mature on september 15 2022 and bear interest at 395 payable semiannually in arrears on march 15 and september 15 changes to interest rates generally affect the fair value of fixedrate debt instruments but not earnings or cash flows we generally have no obligation to prepay the senior notes prior to maturity and therefore interest rate fluctuations should not have a significant impact on our fixedrate debt 

in july 2016 we entered into a credit agreement which provides for aggregate revolving loan commitments of 200000 under the credit agreement we may request increases of up to 300000 to the facility in the form of revolving loan commitments or term loans to the extent that new or existing lenders agree to provide additional revolving loan or term loan commitments the credit agreement provides for a 100000 sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit of which there was approximately 9000  outstanding at december 31 2018  and a 25000 sublimit for a swing line commitment borrowings under the credit agreement generally bear interest for base rate loans at a base rate equal to the highest of i a federal funds rate plus onehalf of one percent ii bank of america’s publicly announced “prime rate” and iii the eurodollar rate plus one percent plus the applicable rate which is based on our debt rating or for eurodollar rate loans at the eurodollar rate equal to libor plus the applicable rate at december 31 2018  there was no debt outstanding under the facility 

our mortgage banking segment is exposed to interest rate risk as it relates to its lending activities the mortgage banking segment originates mortgage loans which are sold through either optional or mandatory forward delivery contracts into the secondary markets all of the mortgage banking segment’s loan portfolio is held for sale and subject to forward sale commitments nvrm also sells all of its mortgages held for sale on a servicing released basis 

nvrm has available a mortgage repurchase agreement which as of december 31 2018  provided for loan repurchases up to 150000 the repurchase agreement is used to fund nvrm’s mortgage origination activities advances under the repurchase agreement carry a pricing rate based on the libor rate plus the libor margin as determined under the repurchase agreement provided that the pricing rate shall not be less than 195 at december 31 2018  there was no debt outstanding under the repurchase agreement 

the following table represents the contractual balances of our onbalance sheet financial instruments at the expected maturity dates as well as the fair values of those onbalance sheet financial instruments at december 31 2018  the expected maturity categories take into consideration the actual and anticipated amortization of principal and do not take into consideration the reinvestment of cash or the refinancing of existing indebtedness because we sell all of the mortgage loans we originate into the secondary markets we have made the assumption that the portfolio of mortgage loans held for sale will mature in the first year

 item 1 business 

general 

nvr inc a virginia corporation was formed in 1980 as nvhomes inc our primary business is the construction and sale of singlefamily detached homes townhomes and condominium buildings all of which are primarily constructed on a presold basis to more fully serve customers of our homebuilding operations we also operate a mortgage banking and title services business we conduct our homebuilding activities directly our mortgage banking operations are operated primarily through a wholly owned subsidiary nvr mortgage finance inc “nvrm” unless the context otherwise requires references to “nvr” “we” “us” or “our” include nvr inc and its consolidated subsidiaries 

we are one of the largest homebuilders in the united states we operate in multiple locations in fourteen states which are primarily in the eastern part of the country and in washington dc during 2017 approximately 23 and 9 of our home settlements occurred in the washington dc and baltimore md metropolitan areas respectively which accounted for approximately 30 and 11 respectively of our 2017 homebuilding revenues our homebuilding operations include the construction and sale of singlefamily detached homes townhomes and condominium buildings under three trade names ryan homes nvhomes and heartland homes our ryan homes product is marketed primarily to firsttime and firsttime moveup buyers ryan homes operates in twentynine metropolitan areas located in maryland virginia washington dc west virginia pennsylvania new york north carolina south carolina florida ohio new jersey delaware indiana illinois and tennessee our nvhomes and heartland homes products are marketed primarily to moveup and luxury buyers nvhomes operates in delaware and the washington dc baltimore md philadelphia pa and raleigh nc metropolitan areas heartland homes operates in the pittsburgh pa metropolitan area 

we generally do not engage in land development see discussion below of our land development activities instead we typically acquire finished building lots at market prices from various third party land developers pursuant to fixed price finished lot purchase agreements “lot purchase agreements” that require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the lot purchase agreements the deposits required under the lot purchase agreements are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and typically range up to 10 of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots 

we believe that our lot acquisition strategy avoids the financial requirements and risks associated with direct land ownership and land development we may at our option choose for any reason and at any time not to perform under these lot purchase agreements by delivering notice of our intent not to acquire the finished lots under contract our sole legal obligation and economic loss for failure to perform under these lot purchase agreements is limited to the amount of the deposit pursuant to the liquidated damage provision contained within the lot purchase agreements we do not have any financial guarantees or completion obligations and we typically do not guarantee lot purchases on a specific performance basis under these lot purchase agreements none of the creditors of any of the development entities with which we have entered these lot purchase agreements have recourse to our general credit we generally seek to maintain control over a supply of lots believed to be suitable to meet our fiveyear business plan 

in addition to constructing homes primarily on a presold basis and utilizing what we believe is a conservative lot acquisition strategy we focus on obtaining and maintaining a leading market position in each market we serve this strategy allows us to gain valuable efficiencies and competitive advantages in our markets which we believe contributes to minimizing the adverse effects of regional economic cycles and provides growth opportunities within these markets our continued success is contingent upon our ability to control an adequate supply of finished lots on which to build as a result in certain specific strategic circumstances we deviate from our historical lot acquisition strategy and engage in joint venture arrangements with land developers or directly acquire raw ground already zoned for its intended use for development once we acquire control of raw ground we determine whether to sell the raw parcel to a developer and enter into a lot purchase agreement with the developer to purchase the finished lots or hire a developer to develop the land on our behalf while joint venture arrangements and direct land development activity are not our preferred method of acquiring finished building lots we may enter into additional transactions in the future on a limited basis where there exists a compelling strategic or prudent financial reason to do so we expect however to continue to acquire substantially all of our finished lot inventory using lot purchase agreements with forfeitable deposits see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 of this form 10k for additional discussion of lots controlled in addition see notes 3 4 and 5 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information regarding lot purchase agreements joint ventures and land under development respectively 

in addition to building and selling homes we provide a number of mortgagerelated services through our mortgage banking operations through operations in each of our homebuilding markets nvrm originates mortgage loans almost exclusively for our homebuyers nvrm generates revenues primarily from origination fees gains on sales of loans and title fees nvrm sells all of the mortgage loans it closes into the secondary markets on a servicing released basis 

segment information for our homebuilding and mortgage banking businesses is included in note 2 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

current business environment 

during 2017 we continued to experience improving new home demand as a result of favorable market conditions including low mortgage interest rates low unemployment and improved consumer confidence however new home prices continued to be constrained due to the competitive market environment we believe that a continuation of the housing market recovery is dependent upon sustained economic growth driven by continued improvements in job and wage growth and household formation for additional information and analysis of recent trends in our operations and financial condition see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 of this form 10k 

homebuilding 

products 

we offer singlefamily detached homes townhomes and condominium buildings with many different basic home designs these home designs have a variety of elevations and numerous other options our homes combine traditional transitional cottage or urban exterior designs with contemporary interior designs and amenities generally include two to four bedrooms and range from approximately 1000 to 9500 finished square feet during 2017 the prices at which we settled homes ranged from approximately 130000 to 20 million and averaged approximately 386900 during 2016 our average price of homes settled was approximately 381200 

markets 

our four reportable homebuilding segments operate in the following geographic regions 



backlog 

backlog which represents homes sold but not yet settled with the customer totaled 8531 units and approximately 33 billion at december 31 2017 compared to 6884 units and approximately 27 billion at december 31 2016 backlog may be impacted by customer cancellations for various reasons that are beyond our control such as the customer’s failure to obtain mortgage financing inability to sell an existing home job loss or a variety of other reasons in any period a portion of the cancellations that we experience are related to new sales that occurred during the same period and a portion are related to sales that occurred in prior periods and therefore appeared in the opening backlog for the current period expressed as the total of all cancellations during the period as a percentage of gross sales during the period our cancellation rate was approximately 14 in 2017 and 15 in both 2016 and 2015 additionally during each of 2017 2016 and 2015 approximately 6 of a reporting quarter’s opening backlog balance cancelled during the quarter we can provide no assurance that our historical cancellation rates are indicative of the actual cancellation rate that may occur in future periods other than those units that are cancelled we expect to settle substantially all of our december 31 2017 backlog during 2018 see “risk factors” in item 1a and “seasonality” in item 7 of this form 10k 

further discussion of settlements new orders and backlog activity by our homebuilding reportable segment for each of the last three years can be found in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 of this form 10k 

construction 

we utilize independent subcontractors under fixed price contracts to perform construction work on our homes we use several independent subcontractors in our various markets and we are not dependent on any single subcontractor or on a small number of subcontractors 

sales and marketing 

our preferred marketing method is for customers to visit a furnished model home featuring many builtin options and a landscaped lot the garages of these model homes are usually converted into temporary sales centers where alternative facades and floor plans are displayed and designs for other models are available for review sales representatives are compensated predominantly on a commission basis 

regulation 

we and our subcontractors must comply with various federal state and local zoning building environmental advertising and consumer credit statutes rules and regulations as well as other regulations and requirements in connection with our construction and sales activities all of these regulations have increased the cost to produce and market our products and in some instances have delayed our developers’ ability to deliver finished lots to us counties and cities in which we build homes have at times declared moratoriums on the issuance of building permits and imposed other restrictions in the areas in which sewage treatment facilities and 

other public facilities do not reach minimum standards in addition our homebuilding operations are regulated in certain areas by restrictive zoning and density requirements that limit the number of homes that can be built within the boundaries of a particular area to date restrictive zoning laws and the imposition of moratoriums have not had a material adverse effect on our construction activities 

competition and market factors 

the housing industry is highly competitive we compete with numerous homebuilders of varying size ranging from local to national in scope some of which have greater financial resources than we do we also face competition from the home resale market our homebuilding operations compete primarily on the basis of price location design quality service and reputation historically we have been one of the market leaders in each of the markets where we build homes 

the housing industry is cyclical and is affected by consumer confidence levels prevailing economic conditions and interest rates other factors that affect the housing industry and the demand for new homes include the availability and the cost of land labor and materials changes in consumer preferences demographic trends and the availability of mortgage finance programs see “risk factors” in item 1a of this form 10k for additional information regarding these risks 

we are dependent upon building material suppliers for a continuous flow of raw materials whenever possible we utilize standard products available from multiple sources in the past such raw materials have been generally available to us in adequate supply 

mortgage banking 

we provide a number of mortgage related services to our homebuilding customers through our mortgage banking operations our mortgage banking operations also include separate subsidiaries that broker title insurance and perform title searches in connection with mortgage loan closings for which they receive commissions and fees because nvrm originates mortgage loans almost exclusively for our homebuilding customers nvrm is dependent on our homebuilding segment in 2017 nvrm closed approximately 13100 loans with an aggregate principal amount of approximately 42 billion as compared to approximately 12300 loans with an aggregate principal amount of approximately 40 billion in 2016 

nvrm sells all of the mortgage loans it closes to investors in the secondary markets on a servicing released basis typically within 30 days from the loan closing nvrm is an approved sellerservicer for fannie mae “fnma” and freddie mac fhlmc mortgage loans and an approved sellerissuer of ginnie mae “gnma” department of veterans affairs “va” and federal housing administration “fha” mortgage loans 

regulation 

nvrm is subject to the rules and regulations of fnma gnma fhlmc va and fha these rules and regulations restrict certain activities of nvrm nvrm is currently eligible and expects to remain eligible to participate in such programs in addition nvrm is subject to regulation at the state and federal level including regulations issued by the consumer financial protection bureau the “cfpb” with respect to specific origination selling and servicing practices 

competition and market factors 

nvrm’s main competition comes from national regional and local mortgage bankers mortgage brokers credit unions and banks in each of these markets nvrm competes primarily on the basis of customer service variety of products offered interest rates offered prices of ancillary services and relative financing availability and costs 

pipeline 

nvrm’s mortgage loans in process that had not closed at december 31 2017 and 2016 had an aggregate principal balance of approximately 22 billion and 18 billion respectively nvrm’s cancellation rate was approximately 31 34 and 29 in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively we can provide no assurance that our historical loan cancellation rates are indicative of the actual loan cancellation rate that may occur in future periods see “risk factors” in item 1a in this form 10k for additional information about factors that could increase our cancellation rate 

employees 

at december 31 2017 we employed approximately 5200 fulltime persons none of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement and we have never experienced a work stoppage we believe that our employee relations are good

 item 1a risk factors 

our business is affected by the risks generally incident to the residential construction business including but not limited to 

 all of these risks are discussed in detail below 

an economic downturn or decline in economic conditions could adversely affect our business and our results of operations 

demand for new homes is sensitive to economic changes driven by conditions such as employment levels job growth consumer confidence and interest rates if the housing industry suffers a downturn our sales may decline which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

interest rate movements inflation and other economic factors can negatively impact our business 

high rates of inflation generally affect the homebuilding industry adversely because of their adverse impact on interest rates high interest rates not only increase the cost of borrowed funds to homebuilders but also have a significant adverse effect on housing demand and on the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective purchasers we are also subject to potential volatility in the price of commodities that impact costs of materials used in our homebuilding business increases in prevailing interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

our financial results also are affected by the risks generally incident to our mortgage banking business including interest rate levels the impact of government regulation on mortgage loan originations and servicing and the need to issue forward commitments to fund and sell mortgage loans our homebuilding customers account for almost all of our mortgage banking business the volume of our continuing homebuilding operations therefore affects our mortgage banking business 

our mortgage banking business also is affected by interest rate fluctuations we also may experience marketing losses resulting from daily increases in interest rates to the extent we are unable to match interest rates and amounts on loans we have committed to originate with forward commitments from third parties to purchase such loans increases in interest rates may have a material adverse effect on our mortgage banking revenue profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

our operations may also be adversely affected by other economic factors within our markets such as negative changes in employment levels job growth wage growth consumer confidence and household formation and availability of mortgage financing one or all of which could result in reduced demand or price depression from current levels such negative trends could have a material adverse effect on homebuilding operations 

these factors and thus the homebuilding and mortgage banking businesses have at times in the past been cyclical in nature any downturn in the national economy or the local economies of the markets in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations in particular during 2017 approximately 23 and 9 of our home settlements occurred in the washington dc and baltimore md metropolitan areas respectively which accounted for approximately 30 and 11 respectively of our 2017 homebuilding revenues thus we are dependent to a significant extent on the economy and demand for housing in those areas 

because almost all of our customers require mortgage financing the availability of suitable mortgage financing could impair the affordability of our homes lower demand for our products and limit our ability to fully deliver our backlog 

our business and earnings depend on the ability of our potential customers to obtain mortgages for the purchase of our homes in addition many of our potential customers must sell their existing homes in order to buy a home from us the tightening of credit standards and the availability of suitable mortgage financing could prevent customers from buying our homes and could prevent buyers of our customers’ homes from obtaining mortgages they need to complete that purchase either of which could result in potential customers’ inability to buy a home from us if potential customers or the buyers of our customers’ current homes are not able to obtain suitable financing the result could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

if our ability to sell mortgages to investors is impaired we may be required to fund these commitments ourselves or we may not be able to originate loans at all 

our mortgage banking business sells all of the loans it originates into the secondary market usually within 30 days from the date of closing and has up to 150 million available under a repurchase agreement to fund mortgage closings see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – liquidity and capital resources” in item 7 of this form 10k for more information about the repurchase agreement in the event that disruptions to the secondary markets tighten or eliminate the available liquidity within the secondary markets for mortgage loans or the underwriting requirements by our secondary market investors continue to become more stringent our ability to sell future mortgages could decline and we could be required among other things to fund our commitments to our buyers with our own financial resources which is limited or require our home buyers to find another source of financing the result of such secondary market disruption could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

if the market value of our inventory or controlled lot position declines our profit could decrease and we may incur losses 

inventory risk can be substantial for homebuilders the market value of building lots and housing inventories can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing market conditions in addition inventory carrying costs can be significant and can result in losses in a poorly performing project or market we must continuously seek and make acquisitions of lots for expansion into new markets as well as for replacement and expansion within our current markets which we generally accomplish by entering into lot purchase agreements and paying forfeitable deposits under the lot purchase agreements to developers for the contractual right to acquire the lots in the event of adverse changes in economic market or project conditions we may cease further building activities in certain communities or restructure existing lot purchase agreements resulting in forfeiture of some or all of any remaining land contract deposit paid to the developer we may also have significant impairments of land under development the forfeiture of land contract deposits or inventory impairments may result in a loss that could have a material adverse effect on our profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

if the underwriting quality of our mortgage originations is found to be deficient our profit could decrease and we may incur losses 

we originate several different loan products to our customers to finance the purchase of their home we sell all of the loans we originate into the secondary mortgage market generally within 30 days from the date of closing all of the loans that we originate are underwritten to the standards and specifications of the ultimate investor insofar as we underwrite our originated loans to those standards we bear no increased concentration of credit risk from the issuance of loans except in certain limited instances where early payment default occurs in the event that a substantial number of the loans that we have originated fall into default and the investors to whom we sold the loans determine that we did not underwrite the loans in accordance with their requirements we could be required to repurchase the loans from the investor or indemnify the investor for any losses incurred any resulting losses could have a material adverse effect on our profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

we may be subject to claims on mortgage loans sold to third parties 

our mortgage banking operations may be responsible for losses associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to investors in the event of errors or omissions relating to certain representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements including representations as to underwriting standards the type of collateral the existence of primary mortgage insurance and the validity of certain borrower representations in connection with the loan the resolution of claims related to alleged breaches of these representations and warranties and repurchase claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition cash flows and results of operations and could result in losses that exceed existing estimates and accruals because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating these matters there can be no assurance that any amounts reserved will be adequate or that any potential inadequacies will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our inability to secure and control an adequate inventory of lots could adversely impact our operations 

the results of our homebuilding operations depend upon our continuing ability to control an adequate number of homebuilding lots in desirable locations there can be no assurance that an adequate supply of building lots will continue to be available to us on terms similar to those available in the past or that we will not be required to devote a greater amount of capital to controlling building lots than we have historically an insufficient supply of building lots in one or more of our markets an inability of our developers to deliver finished lots in a timely fashion due to their inability to secure financing to fund development activities or for other reasons or our inability to purchase or finance building lots on reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

volatility in the credit and capital markets may impact our ability to access necessary financing 

if we require working capital greater than that provided by our operations and our credit facility we may be required to seek to increase the amount available under the facility or seek alternative financing which might not be available on terms that are favorable or acceptable if we are required to seek financing to fund our working capital requirements volatility in credit or capital markets may restrict our flexibility to access financing if we are at any time unsuccessful in obtaining sufficient capital to fund our planned homebuilding expenditures we may experience a substantial delay in the completion of homes then under construction or we may be unable to control or purchase finished building lots any delay could result in cost increases and could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

our mortgage banking operations depend in part on the availability cost and other terms of mortgage financing facilities and may be adversely affected by any shortage or increased cost of such financing additional or replacement financing might not be available on terms that are favorable or acceptable our mortgage banking operations are also dependent upon the securitization market for mortgagebacked securities and could be materially adversely affected by any fluctuation or downturn in such market 

our current indebtedness may impact our future operations 

our existing indebtedness contains restrictive covenants and any future indebtedness may also contain such covenants these covenants include or could include restrictions on our ability to create incur assume or guarantee secured debt enter into sale and leaseback transactions and conditions related to mergers andor the sale of assets substantial losses by us or other action or inaction by us or our subsidiaries could result in the violation of one or more of these covenants which could result in decreased liquidity or a default on our current or future indebtedness thereby having a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

government regulations and environmental matters could negatively affect our operations 

we are subject to various local state and federal statutes ordinances rules and regulations concerning zoning building design construction and similar matters including local regulations that impose restrictive zoning and density requirements in order to limit the number of homes that can eventually be built within the boundaries of a particular area these regulations may further increase the cost to produce and market our products in addition we have from time to time been subject to and may also be subject in the future to periodic delays in our homebuilding projects due to building moratoriums in the areas in which we operate or delays in receiving the necessary governmental approvals changes in regulations that restrict homebuilding activities in one or more of our principal markets could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

in addition new housing developments are often subject to various assessments or impact fees for schools parks streets highways and other public improvements the cost of these assessments is subject to substantial change and could cause increases in the construction cost of our homes which in turn could reduce our profitability 

we are also subject to a variety of local state and federal statutes ordinances rules and regulations concerning the protection of health and the environment we are subject to a variety of environmental conditions that can affect our business and our homebuilding projects the particular environmental laws that apply to any given homebuilding site vary greatly according to the location and environmental condition of the site and the present and former uses of the site and adjoining properties environmental laws and conditions may result in delays cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs or prohibit or severely restrict 

homebuilding activity in certain environmentally sensitive regions or areas thereby adversely affecting our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

increased regulation of the mortgage industry could harm our future sales and earnings 

the mortgage industry remains under intense scrutiny and continues to face increasing regulation at the federal state and local level potential changes to federal laws and regulations could have the effect of limiting the activities of fnma and fhlmc the entities that provide liquidity to the secondary mortgage market which could lead to increases in mortgage interest rates tighter underwriting requirements and fee restrictions and the increasingly complex regulatory environment may negatively impact our mortgage loan origination business in the form of lower demand decreased revenue and increased operating costs 

we are an approved sellerservicer of fnma and fhlmc mortgage loans and an approved sellerissuer of gnma va and fha mortgage loans and are subject to all of those agencies’ rules and regulations any significant impairment of our eligibility to sellservice these loans could have a material adverse impact on our mortgage operations in addition we are subject to regulation at the state and federal level with respect to specific origination selling and servicing practices including the real estate settlement and protection act adverse changes in governmental regulation may have a negative impact on our mortgage loan origination business 

we face competition in our homebuilding and mortgage banking operations 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive we compete with numerous homebuilders of varying size ranging from local to national in scope some of whom have greater financial resources than we do we face competition 

 our homebuilding operations compete primarily on the basis of price location design quality service and reputation 

the mortgage banking industry is also competitive our main competition comes from national regional and local mortgage bankers credit unions banks and mortgage brokers in each of these markets our mortgage banking operations compete primarily on the basis of customer service variety of products offered interest rates offered prices of ancillary services and relative financing availability and costs 

we might not be able to continue to compete successfully in our homebuilding or mortgage banking operations an inability to effectively compete may have an adverse impact on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

a shortage of building materials or labor or increases in materials or labor costs may adversely impact our operations 

the homebuilding business has from time to time experienced building material and labor shortages including fluctuating lumber prices and supply in addition strong construction market conditions could restrict the labor force available to our subcontractors and us in one or more of our markets significant increases in costs resulting from these shortages or delays in construction of homes could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

we rely on subcontractors to construct our homes the failure of our subcontractors to properly construct our homes may be costly 

we engage subcontractors to perform the actual construction of our homes despite our quality control efforts we may discover that our subcontractors have engaged in improper construction practices the occurrence of such events could require us to repair the homes in accordance with our standards and as required by law the cost of satisfying our legal obligations in these instances may be significant and we may be unable to recover the cost of repair from subcontractors suppliers and insurers 

product liability litigation and warranty claims may adversely impact our operations 

construction defect and home warranty claims are common and can represent a substantial risk for the homebuilding industry the cost of insuring against construction defect and product liability claims as well as the claims themselves can be high in addition insurance companies limit coverage offered to protect against these claims further restrictions on coverage availability or significant increases in premium costs or claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

we are subject to litigation proceedings that could harm our business if an unfavorable ruling were to occur 

from time to time we are involved in litigation and other legal proceedings relating to claims arising from our operations in the normal course of business as described in but not limited to item 3 “legal proceedings” of this form 10k we are currently subject to certain legal proceedings litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings may occur these or other litigation or legal proceedings could materially affect our ability to conduct our business in the manner that we expect or otherwise adversely affect us should an unfavorable ruling occur 

our failure to maintain the security of our electronic and other confidential information could expose us to liability and materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

privacy security and compliance concerns have continued to increase as technology has evolved as part of our normal business activities we collect and store certain confidential information including personal information of homebuyersborrowers and information about employees vendors and suppliers this information is entitled to protection under a number of federal and state laws we may share some of this information with vendors who assist us with certain aspects of our business particularly our mortgage and title businesses we have implemented systems and processes intended to secure our information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive confidential and personal data including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies additionally we have increased our monitoring capabilities to enhance early detection and rapid response to potential security anomalies these security measures may not be sufficient for all possible occurrences and may be vulnerable to hacking employee error malfeasance system error faulty password management or other irregularities further development and maintenance of these measures are costly and require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become increasingly sophisticated our failure to maintain the security of the data we are required to protect including via the penetration of our network security and the misappropriation of confidential and personal information could result in business disruption damage to our reputation financial obligations to third parties fines penalties regulatory proceedings and private litigation with potentially large costs and also in deterioration in customers’ confidence in us and other competitive disadvantages and thus could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

weatherrelated and other events beyond our control may adversely impact our operations 

extreme weather or other events such as significant snowfalls hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes forest fires floods terrorist attacks or war may affect our markets our operations and our profitability these events may impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or subcontractors and our housing inventories causing us material increases in costs or delays in construction of homes which could have a material adverse effect upon our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows

overview 

business 

our primary business is the construction and sale of singlefamily detached homes townhomes and condominium buildings all of which are primarily constructed on a presold basis to fully serve customers of our homebuilding operations we also operate a mortgage banking and title services business we primarily conduct our operations in mature markets additionally we generally grow our business through market share gains in our existing markets and by expanding into markets contiguous to our current active markets our four homebuilding reportable segments consist of the following regions 

  

our lot acquisition strategy is predicated upon avoiding the financial requirements and risks associated with direct land ownership and development we generally do not engage in land development see discussion below of our land development activities instead we typically acquire finished lots at market prices from various third party land developers pursuant to lot purchase agreements these lot purchase agreements require deposits typically ranging up to 10 of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots in the form of cash or letters of credit that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the lot purchase agreement this strategy has allowed us to maximize inventory turnover which we believe enables us to minimize market risk and to operate with less capital thereby enhancing rates of return on equity and total capital 

in addition to constructing homes primarily on a presold basis and utilizing what we believe is a conservative lot acquisition strategy we focus on obtaining and maintaining a leading market position in each market we serve this strategy allows us to gain valuable efficiencies and competitive advantages in our markets which we believe contributes to minimizing the adverse effects of regional economic cycles and provides growth opportunities within these markets our continued success is contingent upon our ability to control an adequate supply of finished lots on which to build 

in certain specific strategic circumstances we deviate from our historical lot acquisition strategy and engage in joint venture arrangements with land developers or directly acquire raw ground already zoned for its intended use for development once we acquire control of raw ground we determine whether to sell the raw parcel to a developer and enter into a lot purchase agreement with the developer to purchase the finished lots or to hire a developer to develop the land on our behalf while joint venture arrangements and direct land development activity are not our preferred method of acquiring finished building lots we may enter into additional transactions in the future on a limited basis where there exists a compelling strategic or prudent financial reason to do so we expect however to continue to acquire substantially all of our finished lot inventory using lot purchase agreements with forfeitable deposits 

as of december 31 2017 we controlled lots as described below 

lot purchase agreements 

we controlled approximately 84300  lots under lot purchase agreements with third parties through deposits in cash and letters of credit totaling approximately 393900  and 1900  respectively included in the number of controlled lots are approximately 4600 lots for which we have recorded a contract land deposit impairment reserve of approximately 30000 as of december 31 2017 

joint venture limited liability corporations “jvs” 

we had an aggregate investment totaling approximately 45500  in six  jvs expected to produce approximately 7300  lots of the lots to be produced by the jvs approximately 3900  lots were controlled by us and approximately 3400  lots were either under contract with unrelated parties or currently not under contract 

land under development 

we directly owned four separate raw land parcels zoned for their intended use with a current cost basis including development costs of approximately 34200 that we intend to develop into approximately 500  finished lots we had additional funding commitments of approximately 7900  under a joint development agreement related to one parcel a portion of which we expect will be offset by development credits of approximately 4700  

see notes 3 4 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information regarding lot purchase agreements jvs and land under development respectively 

raw land purchase agreements 

in addition to the lots we currently control as discussed above we have certain properties under contract with land owners that are expected to yield approximately 10700  lots some of these properties may require rezoning or other approvals to achieve the expected yield these properties are controlled with cash deposits and letters of credit totaling approximately 6600  and 100 respectively as of december 31 2017 of which approximately 5800  is refundable if we do not perform under the contract we generally expect to assign the raw land contracts to a land developer and simultaneously enter into a lot purchase agreement with the assignee if the project is determined to be feasible 

current business environment and key financial results 

during 2017 we continued to experience improving new home demand as a result of favorable market conditions including low mortgage interest rates low unemployment and improved consumer confidence however new home prices continued to be constrained due to the competitive market environment 

our consolidated revenues for the year ended december 31 2017 totaled 6305840 an increase of 8 from 5822544 in 2016 our net income for 2017 was 537521 or 12677 per diluted share increases of 26 and 22 compared to 2016 net income and diluted earnings per share respectively our homebuilding gross profit margin percentage increased to 192 in 2017 from 175 in 2016 new orders net of cancellations “new orders” during 2017 increased 13 from 2016 while our average new order sales price decreased 1 to 3832 in 2017 our backlog of homes sold but not yet settled with the customer as of december 31 2017 increased on a unit basis by 24 to 8531 units and increased on a dollar basis by 21 to 3277888 when compared to december 31 2016 

we believe that a continuation of the housing market recovery is dependent upon sustained economic growth driven by continued improvements in job and wage growth and household formation we expect to continue to face gross profit margin pressure which will be impacted by modest pricing power and our ability to manage land and construction costs we also expect to face pressure on mortgage banking profit due to the competitive pricing pressures in the mortgage market we believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities that may arise from future economic and homebuilding market volatility due to the strength of our balance sheet 

homebuilding operations 

the following table summarizes the results of our consolidated homebuilding operations and certain operating activity for each of the last three years 



consolidated homebuilding 

2017 versus 2016 

homebuilding revenues increased 8 in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily as a result of a 7 increase in the number of units settled year over year the increase in the number of units settled was primarily attributable to an 11 higher backlog unit balance entering 2017 compared to the backlog unit balance entering 2016 offset partially by a lower backlog turnover rate year over year 

gross profit margin percentage in 2017 increased to 192 from 175 in 2016 due primarily to modest improvement in pricing moderating construction costs and the increase in the number of units settled which allowed us to better leverage certain operating costs 

the number of new orders increased 13 while the average sales price of new orders decreased 1 in 2017 when compared to 2016 new orders increased in each of our market segments due to more favorable market conditions in 2017 compared to 2016 which led to higher community absorption rates year over year 

selling general and administrative sga expenses in 2017 increased by 3 compared to 2016 but as a percentage of revenue decreased to 64 in 2017 from 67 in 2016 sga expenses as a percentage of revenue were favorably impacted by the 8 increase in revenues 

backlog units and dollars were 8531 units and 3277888 respectively as of december 31 2017 compared to 6884 units and 2704277 respectively as of december 31 2016 the 24 increase in backlog units was primarily attributable to a 19 increase in new orders for the sixmonth period ended december 31 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 backlog dollars were favorably impacted by the increase in backlog units 

backlog may be impacted by customer cancellations for various reasons that are beyond our control such as failure to obtain mortgage financing inability to sell an existing home job loss or a variety of other reasons in any period a portion of the cancellations that we experience are related to new sales that occurred during the same period and a portion are related to sales that occurred in prior periods and therefore appeared in the beginning backlog for the current period expressed as the total of all cancellations during the period as a percentage of gross sales during the period our cancellation rate was approximately 14 in 2017 and approximately 15 in both 2016 and 2015 additionally during each of 2017 2016 and 2015 approximately 6 of a reporting quarter’s opening backlog cancelled during the quarter we can provide no assurance that our historical cancellation rates are indicative of the actual cancellation rate that may occur in future years other than those units that are cancelled we expect to settle substantially all of our december 31 2017 backlog during 2018 see “risk factors” in item 1a of this form 10k 

the backlog turnover rate is impacted by various factors including but not limited to changes in new order activity internal production capacity external subcontractor capacity and other external factors over which we do not exercise control 

2016 versus 2015 

homebuilding revenues increased 13 in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily as a result of a 12 increase in the number of units settled year over year the increase in the number of units settled was attributable to a 14 higher backlog unit balance entering 2016 compared to backlog entering 2015 in addition the number of units settled was favorably impacted by a 10 increase in new orders for the first six months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 

the number of new orders and the average sales price of new orders increased 11 and 2 respectively in 2016 compared to 2015 new orders and the average sales price of new orders increased in each of our market segments due to more favorable market conditions in 2016 compared to 2015 which led to a higher sales absorption rate year over year additionally new orders were favorably impacted by a 3 increase in the average number of active communities year over year 

gross profit margin percentage in 2016 decreased to 175 from 187 in 2015 due to higher construction and selling related costs year over year 

sga expenses in 2016 increased approximately 11300 or 3 compared to 2015 but as a percentage of revenue decreased to 67 from 73 year over year sga expenses increased primarily due to an approximate 10500 increase in marketing costs attributable to the 3 increase in the number of active communities year over year and higher spending levels 

backlog units and dollars were 6884 units and 2704277 respectively as of december 31 2016 compared to 6229 units and 2375182 respectively as of december 31 2015 the 11 increase in backlog units was primarily attributable to a 12 increase in new orders for the six month period ended december 31 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 the 14 increase in backlog dollars was attributable to the increase in backlog units coupled with a 3 increase in the average new order sales price for the six month period ended december 31 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 

reportable homebuilding segments 

homebuilding profit before tax includes all revenues and income generated from the sale of homes less the cost of homes sold sga expenses and a corporate capital allocation charge determined by corporate management the corporate capital allocation charge eliminates in consolidation and is based on the segment’s average net assets employed the corporate capital allocation charged to the operating segment allows the chief operating decision maker to determine whether the operating segment’s results are providing the desired rate of return after covering our cost of capital 

we record charges on contract land deposits when we determine that it is probable that recovery of the deposit is impaired for segment reporting purposes impairments on contract land deposits are generally charged to the operating segment upon the determination to terminate a lot purchase agreement with the developer or to restructure a lot purchase agreement resulting in the forfeiture of the deposit for presentation purposes below the contract land deposit reserve at december 31 2017 and 2016 has been allocated to the reportable segments for the respective years to show contract land deposits on a net basis the net contract land 

deposit balances below also include approximately 2000 and 2400 at december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively of letters of credit issued as deposits in lieu of cash

homebuilding segment reconciliations to consolidated homebuilding operations 

in addition to the corporate capital allocation and contract land deposit impairments discussed above the other reconciling items between homebuilding segment profit and homebuilding consolidated profit before tax include unallocated corporate overhead which includes all management incentive compensation equitybased compensation expense consolidation adjustments and external corporate interest expense our overhead functions such as accounting treasury and human resources are centrally performed and the costs are not allocated to our operating segments consolidation adjustments consist of such items to convert the reportable segments’ results which are predominantly maintained on a cash basis to a full accrual basis for external financial statement presentation 

purposes and are not allocated to our operating segments external corporate interest expense is primarily comprised of interest charges on our 395 senior notes due 2022 the “senior notes” and is not charged to the operating segments because the charges are included in the corporate capital allocation discussed above 



  



  

 

mortgage banking segment 

we conduct our mortgage banking activity through nvrm a wholly owned subsidiary nvrm focuses almost exclusively on serving the homebuilding segment customer base the following table summarizes the results of our mortgage banking operations and certain statistical data for each of the last three years 



2017 versus 2016 

loan closing volume in 2017 increased by approximately 276900 or 7 from 2016 the increase was primarily attributable to a 6 increase in the number of loans closed year over year due primarily to the aforementioned increase in the homebuilding segment’s number of settlements in 2017 as compared to 2016 

segment profit in 2017 increased by approximately 10200 or 16 from 2016 the increase in segment profit was primarily attributable to an increase in mortgage banking fees partially offset by an increase in general and administrative expenses mortgage banking fees increased by approximately 17000 or 15 resulting from the aforementioned increase in loan closing volume and an increase in secondary marketing gains on sales of loans general and administrative expenses increased by approximately 7400 due primarily to an increase in compensation costs as a result of an increase in average headcount compared to 2016 

2016 versus 2015 

loan closing volume in 2016 increased by approximately 460200 or 13 from 2015 the increase was primarily attributable to a 13 increase in the number of loans closed year over year due primarily to the aforementioned increase in the homebuilding segment’s number of settlements in 2016 as compared to 2015 

segment profit in 2016 increased by approximately 12500 or 24 from 2015 the increase in segment profit was primarily attributable to an increase in mortgage banking fees partially offset by an increase in general and administrative expenses mortgage banking fees increased by approximately 19500 or 21 resulting from the aforementioned increase in loan closing volume and an increase in secondary marketing gains on sales of loans general and administrative expenses increased by approximately 8200 due primarily to an increase in compensation costs as a result of an increase in average headcount compared to 2015 

mortgage banking – other 

we sell all of the loans we originate into the secondary mortgage market insofar as we underwrite our originated loans to the standards and specifications of the ultimate investor we have no further financial obligations from the issuance of loans except in certain limited instances where early payment default occurs those underwriting standards are typically equal to or more stringent than the underwriting standards required by fnma fhlmc va and fha because we sell all of our loans and do not service them there is often a substantial delay between the time that a loan goes into default and the time that the investor requests us to reimburse them for losses incurred because of the default we believe that all of the loans that we originate are underwritten to the standards and specifications of the ultimate investor to whom we sell our originated loans we employ a quality control department to ensure that 

our underwriting controls are effective and further assess the underwriting function as part of our assessment of internal controls over financial reporting 

we maintain a reserve for losses on mortgage loans originated that reflects our judgment of the present loss exposure from the loans that we have originated and sold the reserve is calculated based on an analysis of historical experience and exposure at december 31 2017 we had a repurchase reserve of approximately 14000 although we consider the repurchase reserve reflected on the december 31 2017 consolidated balance sheet to be adequate there can be no assurance that this reserve will prove to be adequate to cover losses on loans previously originated 

nvrm is dependent on our homebuilding operation’s customers for business if new orders and selling prices of the homebuilding segment decline nvrm’s operations will also be adversely affected in addition nvrm’s operating results may be adversely affected in future periods due to tightening and volatility of the credit markets changes in investor funding times increased regulation of mortgage lending practices and increased competition in the mortgage market 

seasonality 

we generally have higher new order activity in the first half of the year and higher home settlements revenues and net income in the second half of the year 

effective tax rate 

our consolidated effective tax rate in 2017  2016  and 2015  was 3653  3573  and 3652  respectively the effective tax rate in 2017 was impacted by the following items 

 excluding the charge related to the the net deferred tax asset remeasurement our effective tax rate in 2017 would have been 2913 

our effective tax rate in 2018 excluding any excess tax benefit from stock option exercises will be favorably impacted by the change in the federal statutory tax rate from 35 in 2017 to 21 in 2018 we expect continued rate volatility in future years attributable to the recognition of excess tax benefits from equity plan activity and distributions from the deferred compensation plans 

the act eliminates the performancebased compensation exception from section 162m the act includes a grandfathering provision for compensation pursuant to a written binding contract which was in effect on november 2 2017 and which was not modified in any material respect after such date we believe that our outstanding equity grants and amounts in the deferred compensation plans as of december 31 2017 are in compliance with the grandfathering provision of the act and thus will remain deductible to the extent they are considered performancebased compensation 

recent accounting pronouncements pending adoption 

in may 2014 fasb issued asu 20149 revenue from contracts with customers  which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers the standard will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in gaap when it becomes effective the standard is effective for us as of january 1 2018 we will adopt the standard using the cumulative effect transition method we have determined that the adoption of this standard will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 

in february 2016 fasb issued asu 20162 leases topic 842  which requires lessees to recognize most leases onbalance sheet with a liability equal to the present value of lease payments over the lease term and a rightofuse asset for the right to use the underlying asset over the lease term lessees will recognize expenses on their income statements in a manner similar to current gaap the standard also requires additional disclosures of key information about leasing arrangements the standard is effective for us as of january 1 2019 we believe that the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on both assets and liabilities presented on the balance sheet and are further evaluating the impact of its adoption 

in june 2016 fasb issued asu 201613 financial instruments – credit losses topic 326  which significantly changes the way impairment of financial assets is recognized the standard will require immediate recognition of estimated credit losses expected to occur over the remaining life of many financial assets which will generally result in earlier recognition of allowances for credit losses on loans and other financial instruments the standard’s provisions will be applied as a cumulativeeffect adjustment to beginning retained earnings as of the effective date the standard is effective for us as of january 1 2020 early adoption is permitted for annual and interim periods beginning january 1 2019 we are currently evaluating the effect that the standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 

in august 2016 fasb issued asu 201615 classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments  the objective of the standard is to address the diversity in practice of how certain cash receipts and payments are presented on the statement of cash flows the standard requires that the guidance be applied retrospectively in the first interim and annual periods in which an entity adopts the guidance the standard is effective for us as of january 1 2018 we expect the standard to affect the presentation of distributions from joint ventures in our consolidated statements of cash flows 

in november 2016 fasb issued asu 201618 statement of cash flows topic 230 restricted cash  the amendments in the standard require that the statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash cash equivalents and restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents as a result restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginningofperiod and endofperiod total cash amounts shown on the statement of cash flows the standard is effective for us as of january 1 2018 we do not believe that the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on our consolidated statements of cash flows and related disclosures 

in january 2017 fasb issued asu 20174 intangibles – goodwill and other topic 350 simplifying the test for goodwill impairment  the standard’s objective is to simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating the second step from the goodwill impairment test under the amendments in the standard an entity would perform its annual or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value an impairment charge would then be recognized not to exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit the standard is effective for us on january 1 2020 and early adoption is permitted we do not believe that the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 

  in may 2017 fasb issued asu 201709 compensation – stock compensation topic 718 scope of modification accounting the amendments in the standard clarify when changes in a sharebased payment award must be accounted for as a modification and will allow entities to make certain changes to sharebased payment awards without accounting for them as modifications under the new guidance entities will only apply modification accounting if there are substantive changes made to sharebased payment awards if a change made to a sharebased payment award does not affect the fair value vesting conditions and classification as either an equity or liability instrument modification accounting will not need to be applied the standard is effective for us on january 1 2018 we do not believe that the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures

credit agreement 

on july 15 2016 we entered into an unsecured credit agreement the “credit agreement” with bank of america na as administrative agent swing line lender and lc issuer merrill lynch pierce fenner  smith incorporated as sole lead arranger and sole book runner and the other lenders party thereto which provides for aggregate revolving loan commitments of 200000 the “facility” proceeds of the borrowings under the facility will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes under the credit agreement we may request increases of up to 300000 to the facility in the form of revolving loan commitments or term loans to the extent that new or existing lenders agree to provide additional revolving loan or term loan commitments the credit agreement provides for a 100000 sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit of which there was approximately 7300 outstanding at december 31 2017 and a 25000 sublimit for a swing line commitment borrowings under the credit agreement generally bear interest for base rate loans at a base rate equal to the highest of i a federal funds rate plus onehalf of one percent ii bank of america’s publicly announced “prime rate” and iii the eurodollar rate plus one percent plus the applicable rate which is based on our debt rating or for eurodollar rate loans at the eurodollar rate equal to libor plus the applicable rate

repurchase agreement 

our mortgage banking subsidiary nvrm provides for its mortgage origination and other operating activities using cash generated from operations borrowings from its parent company nvr as well as a revolving mortgage repurchase facility which is nonrecourse to nvr on july 26 2017 nvrm entered into the ninth amendment the “amendment” to its amended and restated master repurchase agreement dated august 2 2011 with us bank national association as amended by the amendment and eight earlier amendments the “repurchase agreement” the repurchase agreement provides borrowing capacity up to 150000 subject to certain sublimits and provides for an incremental commitment pursuant to which we may from time to time request increases in the total commitment available under the repurchase agreement by up to 50000 in the aggregate the purpose of the repurchase agreement is to finance the origination of mortgage loans by nvrm the repurchase agreement expires on july 25 2018 advances under the repurchase agreement carry a pricing rate based on the libor rate plus the libor margin as determined under the repurchase agreement provided that the pricing rate shall not be less than 2125 there are several restrictions on purchased loans including that they cannot be sold to others they cannot be pledged to anyone other than the agent and they cannot support any other borrowing or repurchase agreement

equity repurchases 

in addition to funding growth in our homebuilding and mortgage banking operations we historically have used a substantial portion of our excess liquidity to repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock in open market and privately negotiated transactions this ongoing repurchase activity is conducted pursuant to publicly announced board authorizations and is typically executed in accordance with the safeharbor provisions of rule 10b18 promulgated under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended in addition the board resolutions authorizing us to repurchase shares of our common stock specifically prohibit us from purchasing shares from our officers directors profit sharing plan trust or employee stock ownership plan trust the repurchase program assists us in accomplishing our primary objective creating increases in shareholder value see “market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities” in item 5 of this form 10k for disclosure of amounts repurchased during the fourth quarter of 2017 for the year ended december 31 2017 we repurchased 166520 shares of our common stock at an aggregate purchase price of 422166 as of december 31 2017 we had 361693 available under board approved repurchase authorizations 

cash flows 

for the year ended december 31 2017 cash and cash equivalents increased by 271244 net cash provided by operating activities was 568904 due primarily to cash provided by earnings in 2017 and net proceeds of 104848 from mortgage loan activity cash was primarily used to fund the increase in homebuilding inventory of 154099 which is attributable to an increase in the number of homes under construction at december 31 2017 compared to december 31 2016 net cash used in investing activities in 2017 of 16019 was attributable to cash used for purchases of property plant and equipment of 20269 and investments in unconsolidated jvs of 3800 offset partially by the receipt of capital distributions from our unconsolidated jvs totaling 7203 net cash used in financing activities of 281641 was primarily impacted by our repurchase of 166520 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of 422166 under our ongoing common stock repurchase program as discussed above offset partially by 140525 in proceeds from stock option exercises 

as a result of our adoption of asu 201609 in 2017 we have retrospectively adjusted the prior year cash flow presentation of excess tax benefits from stock option exercises to conform with current year presentation see note 1 for further discussion of the impact of the adoption of asu 201609 

for the year ended december 31 2016 cash and cash equivalents decreased by 28697 net cash provided by operating activities was 398126 cash provided by earnings in 2016 was used to fund the increase in homebuilding inventory of 85194 as a result of an increase in units under construction at december 31 2016 compared to december 31 2015 and the increase of 32280 in contract land deposits cash was favorably impacted by an increase of 58532 in accounts payable and accrued expenses associated with the increase in homebuilding inventory and net proceeds of 49981 from mortgage loan activity net cash used in investing 

activities in 2016 of 9428 primarily included cash used for purchases of property plant and equipment of 22369 offset partially by the receipt of capital distributions from our unconsolidated jvs totaling 12594 net cash used in financing activities of 417395 was primarily impacted by our repurchase of 280288 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of 455351 under our ongoing common stock repurchase program as discussed above offset partially by 38106 in proceeds from stock option exercises 

for the year ended december 31 2015 cash and cash equivalents decreased by 120103 net cash provided by operating activities was 226702 cash provided by earnings in 2015 was used to fund the increase in homebuilding inventory of 134803 as a result of an increase in units under construction at december 31 2015 compared to december 31 2014 and the increase of 37561 in contract land deposits cash was favorably impacted by an increase of 55404 in accounts payable and accrued expenses associated with the increase in homebuilding inventory net cash used in investing activities in 2015 of 1022 included cash used for purchases of property plant and equipment of 18277 and investments in our unconsolidated jvs totaling 1917 these were partially offset by the receipt of capital distributions from our unconsolidated jvs totaling 18489 net cash used in financing activities was 345783 due primarily to our repurchase of 289687 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of 431367 offset partially by 85948 in proceeds from stock option exercises 

at december 31 2017 and 2016 the homebuilding segment had restricted cash of 19438 and 17561 respectively restricted cash in each year was attributable to customer deposits for certain home sales 

we believe that our current cash holdings cash generated from operations and cash available under our shortterm unsecured credit agreement revolving mortgage repurchase facility and the public debt and equity markets will be sufficient to satisfy near and long term cash requirements for working capital and debt service in both our homebuilding and mortgage banking operations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

lot acquisition strategy 

we generally do not engage in land development instead we typically acquire finished building lots at market prices from various land developers under lot purchase agreements that require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the agreement the deposits required under the lot purchase agreements are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percentage typically ranging up to 10 of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots 

we believe that our lot acquisition strategy reduces the financial requirements and risks associated with direct land ownership and land development we may at our option choose for any reason and at any time not to perform under these lot purchase agreements by delivering notice of our intent not to acquire the finished lots under contract our sole legal obligation and economic loss for failure to perform under these purchase agreements is limited to the amount of the deposit pursuant to the liquidated damage provision contained in the lot purchase agreements we do not have any financial guarantees or completion obligations and we typically do not guarantee lot purchases on a specific performance basis under these lot purchase agreements 

at december 31 2017 we controlled approximately 88700 lots through lot purchase agreements jvs and land under development with an aggregate purchase price of approximately 8400000 these lots are controlled by making or committing to make deposits of approximately 533700 in the form of cash and letters of credit our entire risk of loss pertaining to the aggregate purchase price contractual commitment resulting from our nonperformance under the contracts is limited to 393900 in deposits paid and 1900 in letters of credit issued as of december 31 2017 plus approximately 137900 related to deposits to be paid subsequent to december 31 2017 assuming that contractual development milestones are met by the developers and we exercise our option and approximately 1500 in specific performance obligations see contractual obligations  section below as of december 31 2017 we had recorded an impairment valuation allowance of approximately 30000 related to certain cash deposits currently outstanding additionally as of december 31 2017 we had funding commitments totaling 5300  to three of our jvs and approximately 7900 under a joint development agreement related to our land under development a portion of which we expect will be offset by development credits of approximately 4700 

in addition we have certain properties under contract with land owners that are expected to yield approximately 10700 lots which are not included in our number of total lots controlled above some of these properties may require rezoning or other approvals to achieve the expected yield these properties are controlled with cash deposits and letters of credit of approximately 6600 and 100 respectively as of december 31 2017 of which approximately 5800 is refundable if we do not perform under the contract and the remainder is at risk of loss we generally expect to assign the raw land contracts to a land developer and simultaneously enter into a lot purchase agreement with the assignee if the project is determined to be feasible please refer to note 1 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of the contract land deposits and note 3 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of our lot acquisition strategy in relation to our accounting for variable interest entities 

bonds and letters of credit 

we enter into bond or letter of credit arrangements with local municipalities government agencies or land developers to collateralize our obligations under various contracts we had approximately 44300 of contingent obligations under such agreements as of december 31 2017 inclusive of the 2000 of lot acquisition deposits in the form of letters of credit discussed above we believe we will fulfill our obligations under the related contracts and do not anticipate any material losses under these bonds or letters of credit 

mortgage commitments and forward sales 

in the normal course of business nvrm enters into contractual commitments to extend credit to buyers of singlefamily homes with fixed expiration dates the commitments become effective when the borrowers “lockin” a specified interest rate within time frames established by us all mortgagors are evaluated for credit worthiness prior to the extension of the commitment market risk arises if interest rates move adversely between the time of the “lockin” of rates by the borrower and the sale date of the loan to a brokerdealer to mitigate the effect of the interest rate risk inherent in providing rate lock commitments to borrowers we enter into optional or mandatory delivery forward sale contracts to sell whole loans and mortgagebacked securities to brokerdealers the forward sale contracts lock in an interest rate and price for the sale of loans similar to the specific rate lock commitments we do not engage in speculative or trading derivative activities both the rate lock commitments to borrowers and the forward sale contracts to brokerdealers are undesignated derivatives and accordingly are marked to fair value through earnings at december 31 2017 we had contractual commitments to extend credit to borrowers aggregating 490184 and open forward delivery contracts aggregating 705405 which hedge both the rate lock commitments and closed loans held for sale see note 14 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of our fair value accounting 

contractual obligations 

our fixed noncancelable obligations as of december 31 2017 were as follows 



  

 

critical accounting policies 

general 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods we continually evaluate the estimates we use to prepare the consolidated financial statements and update those estimates as necessary in general our estimates are based on historical experience on information from third party professionals and other various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances actual results could differ materially from those estimates made by management 

homebuilding inventory 

the carrying value of inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market value cost of lots and completed and uncompleted housing units represent the accumulated actual cost of the units field construction supervisors’ salaries and related direct overhead expenses are included in inventory costs interest costs are not capitalized into inventory with the exception of land under development upon settlement the cost of the unit is expensed on a specific identification basis cost of building materials is determined on a firstin firstout basis 

sold inventory is evaluated for impairment based on the contractual selling price compared to the total estimated cost to construct unsold inventory is evaluated for impairment by analyzing recent comparable sale prices within the applicable community compared to the costs incurred to date plus the expected costs to complete any calculated impairments are recorded immediately in cost of sales 

land under development and contract land deposits 

land under development 

on a limited basis we directly acquire raw parcels of land already zoned for its intended use to develop into finished lots land under development includes the land acquisition costs direct improvement costs capitalized interest where applicable and real estate taxes 

land under development including the land under development held by our unconsolidated jvs and the related joint venture investments is reviewed for potential writedowns when impairment indicators are present in addition to considering market and economic conditions we assess land under development impairments on a communitybycommunity basis analyzing as applicable current sales absorption levels recent sales’ direct profit and the dollar differential between the projected fullydeveloped cost of the lots and the current market price for lots if indicators of impairment are present for a community we perform an analysis to determine if the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts and if they are impairment charges are required to be recorded in an amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets our determination of fair value is primarily based on discounting the estimated future cash flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams 

at december 31 2017 we had approximately 34200  in land under development in four  separate communities in addition at december 31 2017 we had an aggregate investment totaling approximately 45500  in six  separate jvs that controlled land under development none of the communities classified as land under development nor any of the undeveloped land held by the jvs had any indicators of impairment at december 31 2017 as such we do not believe that any of the land under development is impaired at this time however there can be no assurance that we will not incur impairment charges in the future due to unanticipated adverse changes in the economy or other events adversely affecting specific markets or the homebuilding industry 

contract land deposits 

we purchase finished lots under lot purchase agreements that require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the contract the deposits are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percentage of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots 

we maintain an allowance for losses on contract land deposits that reflects our judgment of the present loss exposure in the existing contract land deposit portfolio at the end of the reporting period to analyze contract land deposit impairments we utilize a loss contingency analysis that is conducted each quarter in addition to considering market and economic conditions we assess contract land deposit impairments on a communitybycommunity basis pursuant to the purchase contract terms analyzing as applicable current sales absorption levels recent sales’ direct profit the dollar differential between the contractual purchase price and the current market price for lots a developer’s financial stability a developer’s financial ability or willingness to reduce lot prices to current market prices and the contract’s default status by either us or the developer along with an analysis of the expected outcome of any such default 

our analysis is focused on whether we can sell houses at an acceptable margin and sales pace in a particular community in the current market with which we are faced because we do not own the finished lots on which we had placed a contract land deposit if the above analysis leads to a determination that we cannot sell homes at an acceptable margin and sales pace at the current contractual lot price we then determine whether we will elect to default under the contract forfeit our deposit and terminate the contract or whether we will attempt to restructure the lot purchase contract which may require us to forfeit the deposit to obtain contract concessions from a developer we also assess whether an impairment is present due to collectability issues resulting from a developer’s nonperformance because of financial or other conditions 

although we consider the allowance for losses on contract land deposits reflected on the december 31 2017 consolidated balance sheet to be adequate see note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included herein there can be no assurance that this allowance will prove to be adequate over time to cover losses due to unanticipated adverse changes in the economy or other events adversely affecting specific markets or the homebuilding industry 

warrantyproduct liability accruals 

warranty and product liability accruals are established to provide for estimated future costs as a result of construction and product defects product recalls and litigation incidental to our business liability estimates are determined based on our judgment considering such factors as historical experience the likely current cost of corrective action manufacturers’ and subcontractors’ participation in sharing the cost of corrective action consultations with third party experts such as engineers and evaluations by our general counsel and outside counsel retained to handle specific product liability cases although we consider the warranty and product liability accrual reflected on the december 31 2017 consolidated balance sheet to be adequate see note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included herein there can be no assurance that this accrual will prove to be adequate over time to cover losses due to increased costs for material and labor the inability or refusal of manufacturers or subcontractors to financially participate in corrective action unanticipated adverse legal settlements or other unanticipated changes to the assumptions used to estimate the warranty and product liability accrual 

equitybased compensation expense 

compensation costs related to our equitybased compensation plans are recognized within our income statement the costs recognized are based on the grantdate fair value compensation cost for equitybased grants is recognized on a straightline basis over the requisite service period for the entire award from the date of grant through the period of the last separately vesting portion of the grant for the recognition of equitybased compensation expense stock options which are subject to a performance condition are treated as a separate award from the “serviceonly” stock options and compensation expense is recognized when it becomes probable that the stated performance target will be achieved the reversal of compensation cost previously recognized for grants forfeited is recorded in the period in which the forfeiture occurs 

we calculate the fair value of our nonpublicly traded employee stock options using the blackscholes optionpricing model while the blackscholes model is a widely accepted method to calculate the fair value of options its results are dependent on input variables two of which expected term and expected volatility are significantly dependent on management’s judgment we have concluded that our historical exercise experience is the best estimate of future exercise patterns to determine a stock option’s expected term to estimate expected volatility we analyze the historical volatility of our common stock over a period equal to the stock option’s expected term changes in management’s judgment of the expected term and the expected volatility could have a material effect on the grantdate fair value calculated and expensed within the income statement 

in addition when recognizing stock based compensation cost related to “performance condition” stock option grants we are required to make a determination as to whether the performance conditions will be met prior to the completion of the actual performance period the performance metric is based on our return on capital performance during a specified three year period based on the date of stock option grant while we currently believe that this performance condition will be satisfied at the target level and are recognizing compensation expense related to such stock options accordingly our future expected activity levels could cause us to make a different determination resulting in a change to the compensation expense to be recognized related to performance condition stock option grants that would otherwise have been recognized to date 

although we believe that the compensation costs recognized in 2017 are representative of the cumulative ratable amortization of the grantdate fair value of unvested stock options outstanding changes to the estimated input values such as expected term and expected volatility and changes to the determination of whether performance condition grants will vest could produce widely different expense valuations and recognition 

mortgage repurchase reserve 

we originate several different loan products to our customers to finance the purchase of their home we sell all of the loans we originate into the secondary mortgage market generally within 30 days from origination all of the loans that we originate are underwritten to the standards and specifications of the ultimate investor insofar as we underwrite our originated loans to those standards we bear no increased concentration of credit risk from the issuance of loans except in certain limited instances where early payment default occurs those underwriting standards are typically equal to or more stringent than the underwriting standards required by fnma fhlmc va and fha we employ a quality control department to ensure that our underwriting controls are effectively operating and further assess the underwriting function as part of our assessment of internal controls over financial reporting we maintain a reserve for losses on mortgage loans originated that reflects our judgment of the present loss exposure in the loans that we have originated and sold the allowance is calculated based on an analysis of historical experience and exposure although we consider the reserve for loan losses reflected on the december 31 2017 consolidated balance sheet to be adequate see note 15 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included herein there can be no assurance that this reserve will prove to be adequate over time to cover losses due to unanticipated changes to the assumptions used to estimate the mortgage repurchase reserve 

impact of inflation changing prices and economic conditions 

see “risk factors” included in item 1a of this form 10k for a description of the impact of inflation changing prices and economic conditions on our business and our financial results see also the discussion of the current business environment in the overview  section above 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

dollars in thousands 

market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates our market risk arises from interest rate risk inherent in our financial instruments and debt obligations interest rate risk results from the possibility that changes in interest rates will cause unfavorable changes in net income or in the value of interest ratesensitive assets liabilities and commitments lower interest rates tend to increase demand for mortgage loans for home purchasers while higher interest rates make it more difficult for potential borrowers to purchase residential properties and to qualify for mortgage loans we have no market rate sensitive instruments held for speculative or trading purposes 

our homebuilding segment is exposed to interest rate risk as it relates to its debt obligations in september 2012 we issued 600000 of senior notes the senior notes mature on september 15 2022 and bear interest at 395 payable semiannually in arrears on march 15 and september 15 changes to interest rates generally affect the fair value of fixedrate debt instruments but not earnings or cash flows we generally have no obligation to prepay the senior notes prior to maturity and therefore interest rate fluctuations should not have a significant impact on our fixedrate debt 

in july 2016 we entered into a credit agreement which provides for aggregate revolving loan commitments of 200000 under the credit agreement we may request increases of up to 300000 to the facility in the form of revolving loan commitments or term loans to the extent that new or existing lenders agree to provide additional revolving loan or term loan commitments the credit agreement provides for a 100000 sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit of which there was approximately 7300 outstanding at december 31 2017 and a 25000 sublimit for a swing line commitment borrowings under the credit agreement generally bear interest for base rate loans at a base rate equal to the highest of i a federal funds rate plus onehalf of one percent ii bank of america’s publicly announced “prime rate” and iii the eurodollar rate plus one percent plus the applicable rate which is based on our debt rating or for eurodollar rate loans at the eurodollar rate equal to libor plus the applicable rate at december 31 2017 there was no debt outstanding under the facility 

our mortgage banking segment is exposed to interest rate risk as it relates to its lending activities the mortgage banking segment originates mortgage loans which are sold through either optional or mandatory forward delivery contracts into the secondary markets all of the mortgage banking segment’s loan portfolio is held for sale and subject to forward sale commitments nvrm also sells all of its mortgages held for sale on a servicing released basis 

nvrm has available a mortgage repurchase agreement which as of december 31 2017 provided for loan repurchases up to 150000 with an incremental commitment pursuant to which nvrm may from time to time request increases in the total commitment available under the agreement by up to 50000 in the aggregate the repurchase agreement is used to fund nvrm’s mortgage origination activities advances under the repurchase agreement carry a pricing rate based on the libor rate plus the libor margin as determined under the repurchase agreement provided that the pricing rate shall not be less than 2125 at december 31 2017 there was no debt outstanding under the repurchase agreement 

the following table represents the contractual balances of our onbalance sheet financial instruments at the expected maturity dates as well as the fair values of those onbalance sheet financial instruments at december 31 2017 the expected maturity categories take into consideration the actual and anticipated amortization of principal and do not take into consideration the reinvestment of cash or the refinancing of existing indebtedness because we sell all of the mortgage loans we originate into the secondary markets we have made the assumption that the portfolio of mortgage loans held for sale will mature in the first year

general

nvr inc a virginia corporation was formed in 1980 as nvhomes inc our primary business is the construction and sale of singlefamily detached homes townhomes and condominium buildings all of which are primarily constructed on a presold basis to more fully serve customers of our homebuilding operations we also operate a mortgage banking and title services business we conduct our homebuilding activities directly our mortgage banking operations are operated primarily through a wholly owned subsidiary nvr mortgage finance inc “nvrm” unless the context otherwise requires references to “nvr” “we” “us” or “our” include nvr inc and its consolidated subsidiaries 

we are one of the largest homebuilders in the united states we operate in multiple locations in fourteen states and washington dc primarily in the eastern part of the united states during 2016 approximately 23 and 11 of our home settlements occurred in the washington dc and baltimore md metropolitan areas respectively which accounted for approximately 30 and 13 respectively of our 2016 homebuilding revenues our homebuilding operations include the construction and sale of singlefamily detached homes townhomes and condominium buildings under three trade names ryan homes nvhomes and heartland homes our ryan homes product is marketed primarily to firsttime and firsttime moveup buyers ryan homes operates in twentynine metropolitan areas located in maryland virginia washington dc west virginia pennsylvania new york north carolina south carolina florida ohio new jersey delaware indiana illinois and tennessee our nvhomes and heartland homes products are marketed primarily to moveup and upscale buyers nvhomes operates in delaware and the washington dc baltimore md philadelphia pa and raleigh nc metropolitan areas heartland homes operates in the pittsburgh pa metropolitan area in 2016 our average price of a settled unit was approximately 381200

we generally do not engage in land development see discussion below of our land development activities instead we typically acquire finished building lots at market prices from various third party land developers pursuant to fixed price finished lot purchase agreements “lot purchase agreements” that require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the lot purchase agreements the deposits required under the lot purchase agreements are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percentage typically ranging up to 10 of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots 

we believe that our lot acquisition strategy avoids the financial requirements and risks associated with direct land ownership and land development we may at our option choose for any reason and at any time not to perform under these lot purchase agreements by delivering notice of our intent not to acquire the finished lots under contract our sole legal obligation and economic loss for failure to perform under these lot purchase agreements is limited to the amount of the deposit pursuant to the liquidated damage provision contained within the lot purchase agreements we do not have any financial guarantees or completion obligations and we typically do not guarantee lot purchases on a specific performance basis under these lot purchase agreements none of the creditors of any of the development entities with which we have entered these lot purchase agreements have recourse to our general credit we generally seek to maintain control over a supply of lots believed to be suitable to meet our fiveyear business plan 

in addition to constructing homes primarily on a presold basis and utilizing what we believe is a conservative lot acquisition strategy we focus on obtaining and maintaining a leading market position in each market we serve this strategy allows us to gain valuable efficiencies and competitive advantages in our markets which we believe contributes to minimizing the adverse effects of regional economic cycles and provides growth opportunities within these markets our continued success is contingent upon our ability to control an adequate supply of finished lots on which to build as a result in certain specific strategic circumstances we deviate from our historical lot acquisition strategy and engage in joint venture arrangements with land developers or directly acquire raw ground already zoned for its intended use for development once we acquire control of raw ground we determine whether to sell the raw parcel to a developer and enter into a lot purchase agreement with the developer to purchase the finished lots or hire a developer to develop the land on our behalf while joint venture arrangements and direct land development activity are not our preferred method of acquiring finished building lots we may enter into additional transactions in the future on a limited basis where there exists a compelling strategic or prudent financial reason to do so we expect however to continue to acquire substantially all of our finished lot inventory using lot purchase agreements with forfeitable deposits see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 of this form 10k for additional discussion of lots controlled in addition see notes 3 4 and 5 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information regarding lot purchase agreements jvs and land under development respectively 

in addition to building and selling homes we provide a number of mortgagerelated services through our mortgage banking operations through operations in each of our homebuilding markets nvrm originates mortgage loans almost exclusively for our homebuyers nvrm generates revenues primarily from origination fees gains on sales of loans and title fees nvrm sells all of the mortgage loans it closes into the secondary markets on a servicing released basis 

 

segment information for our homebuilding and mortgage banking businesses is included in note 2 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

current business environment

the housing market in 2016 continued the trend experienced in 2015 of steady new home demand however new home prices continued to be constrained due to the competitive market environment the housing market also continues to face challenges from tight mortgage underwriting standards as well as from higher mortgage interest rates which towards the end of 2016 began to move up from historical lows we believe that a continuation of the housing market recovery is dependent upon a sustained overall economic recovery driven by continued improvement in job and wage growth and household formation for additional information and analysis of recent trends in our operations and financial condition see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 of this form 10k

homebuilding 

products

we offer singlefamily detached homes townhomes and condominium buildings with many different basic home designs these home designs have a variety of elevations and numerous other options our homes combine traditional transitional cottage or urban exterior designs with contemporary interior designs and amenities generally include two to four bedrooms and range from approximately 1000 to 9000 finished square feet during 2016 the prices at which we settled homes ranged from approximately 140000 to 18 million and averaged approximately 381200 during 2015 our average price of homes settled was approximately 379900

markets

our four reportable homebuilding segments operate in the following geographic regions

 



backlog

backlog totaled 6884 units and approximately 27 billion at december 31 2016 compared to backlog of 6229 units and approximately 24 billion at december 31 2015 backlog which represents homes sold but not yet settled with the customer may be impacted by customer cancellations for various reasons that are beyond our control such as the customer’s failure to obtain mortgage financing inability to sell an existing home job loss or a variety of other reasons in any period a portion of the cancellations that we experience are related to new sales that occurred during the same period and a portion are related to sales that occurred in prior periods and therefore appeared in the opening backlog for the current period expressed as the total of all cancellations during the period as a percentage of gross sales during the period our cancellation rate was approximately 16 in 2016 and 15 in both 2015 and 2014 additionally during each of 2016 2015 and 2014 approximately 6 of a reporting quarter’s opening backlog balance cancelled during the quarter we can provide no assurance that our historical cancellation rates are indicative of the actual cancellation rate that may occur in future periods other than those units that are cancelled we expect to settle substantially all of our december 31 2016 backlog during 2017 see “risk factors” in item 1a and “seasonality” in item 7 of this form 10k

further discussion of settlements new orders and backlog activity by our homebuilding reportable segment for each of the last three years can be found in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 of this form 10k

construction

we utilize independent subcontractors under fixed price contracts to perform construction work on our homes we use several independent subcontractors in our various markets and we are not dependent on any single subcontractor or on a small number of subcontractors

sales and marketing

our preferred marketing method is for customers to visit a furnished model home featuring many builtin options and a landscaped lot the garages of these model homes are usually converted into temporary sales centers where alternative facades and floor plans are displayed and designs for other models are available for review sales representatives are compensated predominantly on a commission basis

 

regulation 

we and our subcontractors must comply with various federal state and local zoning building environmental advertising and consumer credit statutes rules and regulations as well as other regulations and requirements in connection with our construction and sales activities all of these regulations have increased the cost to produce and market our products and in some instances have delayed our developers’ ability to deliver finished lots to us counties and cities in which we build homes have at times declared moratoriums on the issuance of building permits and imposed other restrictions in the areas in which sewage treatment facilities and other public facilities do not reach minimum standards in addition our homebuilding operations are regulated in certain areas by restrictive zoning and density requirements that limit the number of homes that can be built within the boundaries of a particular area to date restrictive zoning laws and the imposition of moratoriums have not had a material adverse effect on our construction activities

competition and market factors

the housing industry is highly competitive we compete with numerous homebuilders of varying size ranging from local to national in scope some of which have greater financial resources than we do we also face competition from the home resale market our homebuilding operations compete primarily on the basis of price location design quality service and reputation historically we have been one of the market leaders in each of the markets where we build homes 

the housing industry is cyclical and is affected by consumer confidence levels prevailing economic conditions and interest rates other factors that affect the housing industry and the demand for new homes include the availability and the cost of land labor and materials changes in consumer preferences demographic trends and the availability of mortgage finance programs see “risk factors” in item 1a of this form 10k for additional information regarding these risks

we are dependent upon building material suppliers for a continuous flow of raw materials whenever possible we utilize standard products available from multiple sources in the past such raw materials have been generally available to us in adequate supply

mortgage banking

we provide a number of mortgage related services to our homebuilding customers through our mortgage banking operations our mortgage banking operations also include separate subsidiaries that broker title insurance and perform title searches in connection with mortgage loan closings for which they receive commissions and fees because nvrm originates mortgage loans almost exclusively for our homebuilding customers nvrm is dependent on our homebuilding segment in 2016 nvrm closed approximately 12300 loans with an aggregate principal amount of approximately 40 billion as compared to approximately 10900 loans with an aggregate principal amount of approximately 35 billion in 2015

nvrm sells all of the mortgage loans it closes to investors in the secondary markets on a servicing released basis typically within 30 days from the loan closing nvrm is an approved sellerservicer for fannie mae “fnma” mortgage loans and an approved sellerissuer of ginnie mae “gnma” freddie mac “fhlmc” department of veterans affairs “va” and federal housing administration “fha” mortgage loans

regulation

nvrm is subject to the rules and regulations of fnma gnma fhlmc va and fha these rules and regulations restrict certain activities of nvrm nvrm is currently eligible and expects to remain eligible to participate in such programs in addition nvrm is subject to regulation at the state and federal level including regulations issued by the consumer financial protection bureau the “cfpb” with respect to specific origination selling and servicing practices

competition and market factors

nvrm’s main competition comes from national regional and local mortgage bankers mortgage brokers credit unions and banks in each of these markets nvrm competes primarily on the basis of customer service variety of products offered interest rates offered prices of ancillary services and relative financing availability and costs

pipeline

nvrm’s mortgage loans in process that had not closed at december 31 2016 and 2015 had an aggregate principal balance of approximately 18 billion and 16 billion respectively nvrm’s cancellation rate was approximately 34 29 and 31 in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively we can provide no assurance that our historical loan cancellation rates are indicative of the actual loan cancellation rate that may occur in future periods see “risk factors” in item 1a in this form 10k for additional information about factors that could increase our cancellation rate

 

employees 

at december 31 2016 we employed approximately 4900 fulltime persons none of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement and we have never experienced a work stoppage we believe that our employee relations are good

risk factors

tableend

our business is affected by the risks generally incident to the residential construction business including but not limited to 











all of these risks are discussed in detail below 

 

an economic downturn or decline in economic conditions could adversely affect our business and our results of operations 

demand for new homes is sensitive to economic changes driven by conditions such as employment levels job growth consumer confidence and interest rates if the housing industry suffers a downturn our sales may decline which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

interest rate movements inflation and other economic factors can negatively impact our business 

high rates of inflation generally affect the homebuilding industry adversely because of their adverse impact on interest rates high interest rates not only increase the cost of borrowed funds to homebuilders but also have a significant adverse effect on housing demand and on the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective purchasers we are also subject to potential volatility in the price of commodities that impact costs of materials used in our homebuilding business increases in prevailing interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows

our financial results also are affected by the risks generally incident to our mortgage banking business including interest rate levels the impact of government regulation on mortgage loan originations and servicing and the need to issue forward commitments to fund and sell mortgage loans our homebuilding customers account for almost all of our mortgage banking business the volume of our continuing homebuilding operations therefore affects our mortgage banking business

our mortgage banking business also is affected by interest rate fluctuations we also may experience marketing losses resulting from daily increases in interest rates to the extent we are unable to match interest rates and amounts on loans we have committed to originate with forward commitments from third parties to purchase such loans increases in interest rates may have a material adverse effect on our mortgage banking revenue profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows

our operations may also be adversely affected by other economic factors within our markets such as negative changes in employment levels job growth wage growth consumer confidence and household formation and availability of mortgage financing one or all of which could result in reduced demand or price depression from current levels such negative trends could have a material adverse effect on homebuilding operations

these factors and thus the homebuilding business have at times in the past been cyclical in nature any downturn in the national economy or the local economies of the markets in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations in particular during 2016 approximately 23 and 11 of our home settlements occurred in the washington dc and baltimore md metropolitan areas respectively which accounted for approximately 30 and 13 respectively of our 2016 homebuilding revenues thus we are dependent to a significant extent on the economy and demand for housing in those areas

because almost all of our customers require mortgage financing the availability of suitable mortgage financing could impair the affordability of our homes lower demand for our products and limit our ability to fully deliver our backlog 

our business and earnings depend on the ability of our potential customers to obtain mortgages for the purchase of our homes in addition many of our potential customers must sell their existing homes in order to buy a home from us the tightening of credit standards and the availability of suitable mortgage financing could prevent customers from buying our homes and could prevent buyers of our customers’ homes from obtaining mortgages they need to complete that purchase either of which could result in our potential customers’ inability to buy a home from us if our potential customers or the buyers of our customers’ current homes are not able to obtain suitable financing the result could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

if our ability to sell mortgages to investors is impaired we may be required to fund these commitments ourselves or may not be able to originate loans at all 

our mortgage banking business sells all of the loans it originates into the secondary market usually within 30 days from the date of closing and has up to 150 million available under a repurchase agreement to fund mortgage closings see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – liquidity and capital resources” in item 7 of this form 10k for more information about the repurchase agreement in the event that disruptions to the secondary markets tighten or eliminate the available liquidity within the secondary markets for mortgage loans or the underwriting requirements by our secondary market investors continue to become more stringent our ability to sell future mortgages could decline and we could be required among other things to fund our commitments to our buyers with our own financial resources which is limited or require our home buyers to find another source of financing the result of such secondary market disruption could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

 

if the market value of our inventory or controlled lot position declines our profit cou ld decrease and we may incur losses 

inventory risk can be substantial for homebuilders the market value of building lots and housing inventories can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing market conditions in addition inventory carrying costs can be significant and can result in losses in a poorly performing project or market we must continuously seek and make acquisitions of lots for expansion into new markets as well as for replacement and expansion within our current markets which we generally accomplish by entering into lot purchase agreements and paying forfeitable deposits under the lot purchase agreements to developers for the contractual right to acquire the lots in the event of adverse changes in economic or market conditions we may cease further building activities in certain communities or restructure existing lot purchase agreements resulting in forfeiture of some or all of any remaining land contract deposit paid to the developer we may also have significant impairments of land under development the forfeiture of land contract deposits or inventory impairments may result in a loss that could have a material adverse effect on our profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

if the underwriting quality of our mortgage originations is found to be deficient our profit could decrease and we may incur losses 

we originate several different loan products to our customers to finance the purchase of their home we sell all of the loans we originate into the secondary mortgage market generally within 30 days from the date of closing all of the loans that we originate are underwritten to the standards and specifications of the ultimate investor insofar as we underwrite our originated loans to those standards we bear no increased concentration of credit risk from the issuance of loans except in certain limited instances where early payment default occurs in the event that a substantial number of the loans that we have originated fall into default and the investors to whom we sold the loans determine that we did not underwrite the loans in accordance with their requirements we could be required to repurchase the loans from the investor or indemnify the investor for any losses incurred any resulting losses could have a material adverse effect on our profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows

we may be subject to claims on mortgage loans sold to third parties 

our mortgage banking operations may be responsible for losses associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to investors in the event of errors or omissions relating to certain representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements including representations as to underwriting standards the type of collateral the existence of primary mortgage insurance and the validity of certain borrower representations in connection with the loan the resolution of claims related to alleged breaches of these representations and warranties and repurchase claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition cash flows and results of operations and could result in losses that exceed existing estimates and accruals because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating these matters there can be no assurance that any amounts reserved will be adequate or that any potential inadequacies will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our inability to secure and control an adequate inventory of lots could adversely impact our operations

the results of our homebuilding operations depend upon our continuing ability to control an adequate number of homebuilding lots in desirable locations there can be no assurance that an adequate supply of building lots will continue to be available to us on terms similar to those available in the past or that we will not be required to devote a greater amount of capital to controlling building lots than we have historically an insufficient supply of building lots in one or more of our markets an inability of our developers to deliver finished lots in a timely fashion due to their inability to secure financing to fund development activities or for other reasons or our inability to purchase or finance building lots on reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows

volatility in the credit and capital markets may impact our ability to access necessary financing

if we require working capital greater than that provided by our operations and our credit facility we may be required to seek to increase the amount available under the facility or seek alternative financing which might not be available on terms that are favorable or acceptable if we are required to seek financing to fund our working capital requirements volatility in credit or capital markets may restrict our flexibility to access financing if we are at any time unsuccessful in obtaining sufficient capital to fund our planned homebuilding expenditures we may experience a substantial delay in the completion of homes then under construction or we may be unable to control or purchase finished building lots any delay could result in cost increases and could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

our mortgage banking operations depend in part on the availability cost and other terms of mortgage financing facilities and may be adversely affected by any shortage or increased cost of such financing additional or replacement financing might not be available on terms that are favorable or acceptable our mortgage banking operations are also dependent upon the securitization market for mortgagebacked securities and could be materially adversely affected by any fluctuation or downturn in such market 

 

our current indebtedness ma y impact our future operations 

our existing indebtedness contains restrictive covenants and any future indebtedness may also contain such covenants these covenants include or could include restrictions on our ability to create incur assume or guarantee secured debt enter into sale and leaseback transactions and conditions related to mergers andor the sale of assets substantial losses by us or other action or inaction by us or our subsidiaries could result in the violation of one or more of these covenants which could result in decreased liquidity or a default on our current or future indebtedness thereby having a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows

government regulations and environmental matters could negatively affect our operations 

we are subject to various local state and federal statutes ordinances rules and regulations concerning zoning building design construction and similar matters including local regulations that impose restrictive zoning and density requirements in order to limit the number of homes that can eventually be built within the boundaries of a particular area these regulations may further increase the cost to produce and market our products in addition we have from time to time been subject to and may also be subject in the future to periodic delays in our homebuilding projects due to building moratoriums in the areas in which we operate or delays in receiving the necessary governmental approvals changes in regulations that restrict homebuilding activities in one or more of our principal markets could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

in addition new housing developments are often subject to various assessments or impact fees for schools parks streets highways and other public improvements the cost of these assessments is subject to substantial change and could cause increases in the construction cost of our homes which in turn could reduce our profitability 

we are also subject to a variety of local state and federal statutes ordinances rules and regulations concerning the protection of health and the environment we are subject to a variety of environmental conditions that can affect our business and our homebuilding projects the particular environmental laws that apply to any given homebuilding site vary greatly according to the location and environmental condition of the site and the present and former uses of the site and adjoining properties environmental laws and conditions may result in delays cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs or prohibit or severely restrict homebuilding activity in certain environmentally sensitive regions or areas thereby adversely affecting our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows

increased regulation of the mortgage industry could harm our future sales and earnings 

the mortgage industry remains under intense scrutiny and continues to face increasing regulation at the federal state and local level potential changes to federal laws and regulations could have the effect of limiting the activities of fnma and fhlmc the entities that provide liquidity to the secondary mortgage market which could lead to increases in mortgage interest rates tighter underwriting requirements and fee restrictions and the increasingly complex regulatory environment may negatively impact our mortgage loan origination business in the form of lower demand decreased revenue and increased operating costs 

we are an approved sellerservicer of fnma mortgage loans and an approved sellerissuer of gnma fhlmc va and fha mortgage loans and are subject to all of those agencies’ rules and regulations any significant impairment of our eligibility to sellservice these loans could have a material adverse impact on our mortgage operations in addition we are subject to regulation at the state and federal level with respect to specific origination selling and servicing practices including the real estate settlement and protection act adverse changes in governmental regulation may have a negative impact on our mortgage loan origination business

we face competition in our homebuilding and mortgage banking operations 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive we compete with numerous homebuilders of varying size ranging from local to national in scope some of whom have greater financial resources than we do we face competition 







our homebuilding operations compete primarily on the basis of price location design quality service and reputation 

the mortgage banking industry is also competitive our main competition comes from national regional and local mortgage bankers credit unions banks and mortgage brokers in each of these markets our mortgage banking operations compete primarily on the basis of customer service variety of products offered interest rates offered prices of ancillary services and relative financing availability and costs 

 

we might not be able to continue to compete successfully in our homebuilding or mortgage banking operations an inability to effectively compete may have an adverse impact on our sales profitability stock performance ability t o service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

a shortage of building materials or labor or increases in materials or labor costs may adversely impact our operations 

the homebuilding business has from time to time experienced building material and labor shortages including fluctuating lumber prices and supply in addition strong construction market conditions could restrict the labor force available to our subcontractors and us in one or more of our markets significant increases in costs resulting from these shortages or delays in construction of homes could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

we rely on subcontractors to construct our homes the failure of our subcontractors to properly construct our homes may be costly 

we engage subcontractors to perform the actual construction of our homes despite our quality control efforts we may discover that our subcontractors have engaged in improper construction practices the occurrence of such events could require us to repair the homes in accordance with our standards and as required by law the cost of satisfying our legal obligations in these instances may be significant and we may be unable to recover the cost of repair from subcontractors suppliers and insurers 

product liability litigation and warranty claims may adversely impact our operations 

construction defect and home warranty claims are common and can represent a substantial risk for the homebuilding industry the cost of insuring against construction defect and product liability claims as well as the claims themselves can be high in addition insurance companies limit coverage offered to protect against these claims further restrictions on coverage availability or significant increases in premium costs or claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

we are subject to litigation proceedings that could harm our business if an unfavorable ruling were to occur 

from time to time we may become involved in litigation and other legal proceedings relating to claims arising from our operations in the normal course of business as described in but not limited to item 3 “legal proceedings” of this form 10k we are currently subject to certain legal proceedings litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings may occur these or other litigation or legal proceedings could materially affect our ability to conduct our business in the manner that we expect or otherwise adversely affect us should an unfavorable ruling occur 

our failure to maintain the security of our electronic and other confidential information could expose us to liability and materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

privacy security and compliance concerns have continued to increase as technology has evolved as part of our normal business activities we collect and store certain confidential information including personal information of homebuyersborrowers and information about employees vendors and suppliers this information is entitled to protection under a number of federal and state laws we may share some of this information with vendors who assist us with certain aspects of our business particularly our mortgage and title businesses our failure to maintain the security of the data we are required to protect including via the penetration of our network security and the misappropriation of confidential and personal information could result in business disruption damage to our reputation financial obligations to third parties fines penalties regulatory proceedings and private litigation with potentially large costs and also in deterioration in customers’ confidence in us and other competitive disadvantages and thus could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

weatherrelated and other events beyond our control may adversely impact our operations 

extreme weather or other events such as significant snowfalls hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes forest fires floods terrorist attacks or war may affect our markets our operations and our profitability these events may impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or subcontractors causing us material increases in costs or delays in construction of homes which could have a material adverse effect upon our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows

overview 

business 

our primary business is the construction and sale of singlefamily detached homes townhomes and condominium buildings all of which are primarily constructed on a presold basis to fully serve customers of our homebuilding operations we also operate a mortgage banking and title services business we primarily conduct our operations in mature markets additionally we generally grow our business through market share gains in our existing markets and by expanding into markets contiguous to our current active markets our four homebuilding reportable segments consist of the following regions 

 



our lot acquisition strategy is predicated upon avoiding the financial requirements and risks associated with direct land ownership and development we generally do not engage in land development see discussion below of our land development activities instead we typically acquire finished lots at market prices from various third party land developers pursuant to lot purchase agreements these lot purchase agreements require deposits typically ranging up to 10 of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots in the form of cash or letters of credit that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the lot purchase agreement this strategy has allowed us to maximize inventory turnover which we believe enables us to minimize market risk and to operate with less capital thereby enhancing rates of return on equity and total capital 

in addition to constructing homes primarily on a presold basis and utilizing what we believe is a conservative lot acquisition strategy we focus on obtaining and maintaining a leading market position in each market we serve this strategy allows us to gain valuable efficiencies and competitive advantages in our markets which we believe contributes to minimizing the adverse effects of regional economic cycles and provides growth opportunities within these markets our continued success is contingent upon our ability to control an adequate supply of finished lots on which to build 

in certain specific strategic circumstances we deviate from our historical lot acquisition strategy and engage in joint venture arrangements with land developers or directly acquire raw ground already zoned for its intended use for development once we acquire control of raw ground we determine whether to sell the raw parcel to a developer and enter into a lot purchase agreement with the developer to purchase the finished lots or to hire a developer to develop the land on our behalf while joint venture arrangements and direct land development activity are not our preferred method of acquiring finished building lots we may enter into additional transactions in the future on a limited basis where there exists a compelling strategic or prudent financial reason to do so we expect however to continue to acquire substantially all of our finished lot inventory using lot purchase agreements with forfeitable deposits

as of december 31 2016 we controlled lots as described below

lot purchase agreements

we controlled approximately 73200 lots under lot purchase agreements with third parties through deposits in cash and letters of credit totaling approximately 396200 and 2400 respectively included in the number of controlled lots are approximately 4000 lots for which we have recorded a contract land deposit impairment reserve of approximately 31300 as of december 31 2016 

joint venture limited liability corporations “jvs”

we had an aggregate investment totaling approximately 49400 in six jvs expected to produce approximately 7400 lots of the lots to be produced by the jvs approximately 4200 lots were controlled by us and approximately 3200 lots were either under contract with unrelated parties or currently not under contract

land under development

we directly owned four separate raw land parcels zoned for their intended use with a current cost basis including development costs of approximately 47000 that we intend to develop into approximately 600 finished lots we had additional funding commitments of approximately 12000 under a joint development agreement related to one parcel a portion of which we expect will be offset by development credits of approximately 7100 

see notes 3 4 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information regarding lot purchase agreements jvs and land under development respectively

 

raw land purchase agreements 

in a ddition to the lots we currently control as discussed above we have certain properties under contract with land owners that are expected to yield approximately 9600 lots some of these properties may require rezoning or other approvals to achieve the expected yield these properties are controlled with cash deposits totaling approximately 14900 as of december 31 2016 of which approximately 1400 is refundable if we do not perform under the contract we generally expect to assign the raw land contracts to a land developer and simultaneously enter into a lot purchase agreement with the assignee if the project is determined to be feasible 

current business environment and key financial results 

the housing market in 2016 continued the trend experienced in 2015 of steady new home demand however new home prices continued to be constrained due to the competitive market environment the housing market also faces challenges from tight mortgage underwriting standards as well as from higher mortgage interest rates which towards the end of 2016 began to move up from historical lows 

our consolidated revenues for the year ended december 31 2016 totaled 5822544 an increase of 13 from 5159008 in 2015 our net income for 2016 was 425262 or 10361 per diluted share increases of 11 and 15 compared to 2015 net income and diluted earnings per share respectively diluted earnings per share was favorably impacted by our ongoing share repurchase program our homebuilding gross profit margin percentage decreased to 175 in 2016 from 187 in 2015 new orders net of cancellations “new orders” during 2016 increased 11 from 2015 while our average new order sales price increased 2 to 3864 in 2016 our backlog of homes sold but not yet settled with the customer as of december 31 2016 increased on a unit basis by 11 to 6884 units and increased on a dollar basis by 14 to 2704277 when compared to december 31 2015

we believe that a continuation of the housing market recovery is dependent upon a sustained overall economic recovery driven by continued improvement in job and wage growth and household formation we expect to continue to face gross profit margin and pricing pressures due to higher land and construction costs as well as increased competition associated with the increase in the number of new home communities in our markets we believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities that may arise from future economic and homebuilding market volatility due to the strength of our balance sheet

homebuilding operations 

the following table summarizes the results of our consolidated homebuilding operations and certain operating activity for each of the last three years 

 



 

consolidated homebuilding

2016 versus 2015

homebuilding revenues increased 13 in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily as a result of a 12 increase in the number of units settled year over year the increase in the number of units settled was attributable to a 14 higher backlog unit balance entering 2016 compared to backlog entering 2015 in addition the number of units settled was favorably impacted by a 10 increase in new orders for the first six months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015

the number of new orders and the average sales price of new orders increased 11 and 2 respectively in 2016 compared to 2015 new orders and the average sales price of new orders increased in each of our market segments due to more favorable 

 

market conditions in 2016 compared to 2015 which led to a higher sales absorption rate year over year additionally new orders were favorably impacted by a 3 increase in the average number of active communities year over year 

gross profit margin percentage in 2016 decreased to 175 from 187 in 2015 due to higher construction and selling related costs year over year we expect continued gross margin pressure over the next several quarters due to cost pressures

sga expenses in 2016 increased approximately 11300 or 3 compared to 2015 but as a percentage of revenue decreased to 67 from 73 year over year sga expenses increased primarily due to an approximate 10500 increase in marketing costs attributable to the 3 increase in the number of active communities year over year and higher spending levels 

backlog represents homes sold but not yet settled with the customer backlog units and dollars were 6884 units and 2704277 respectively as of december 31 2016 compared to 6229 units and 2375182 respectively as of december 31 2015 the 11 increase in backlog units was primarily attributable to a 12 increase in new orders for the six month period ended december 31 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 the 14 increase in backlog dollars was attributable to the increase in backlog units coupled with a 3 increase in the average new order sales price for the six month period ended december 31 2016 compared to the same period in 2015

backlog may be impacted by customer cancellations for various reasons that are beyond our control such as failure to obtain mortgage financing inability to sell an existing home job loss or a variety of other reasons in any period a portion of the cancellations that we experience are related to new sales that occurred during the same period and a portion are related to sales that occurred in prior periods and therefore appeared in the beginning backlog for the current period expressed as the total of all cancellations during the period as a percentage of gross sales during the period our cancellation rate was approximately 16 in 2016 and 15 in both 2015 and 2014 additionally during each of 2016 2015 and 2014 approximately 6 of a reporting quarter’s opening backlog cancelled during the quarter we can provide no assurance that our historical cancellation rates are indicative of the actual cancellation rate that may occur in future years other than those units that are cancelled we expect to settle substantially all of our december 31 2016 backlog during 2017 see “risk factors” in item 1a of this form 10k

the backlog turnover rate is impacted by various factors including but not limited to changes in new order activity internal production capacity external subcontractor capacity and other external factors over which we do not exercise control

2015 versus 2014

homebuilding revenues increased 16 in 2015 compared 2014 as a result of a 12 increase in the number of units settled and a 3 increase in the average settlement price year over year units settled and the average settlement prices were higher in each of our market segments year over year the increases in the number of units settled and the average settlement price were attributable to an 11 higher backlog unit balance entering 2015 and a 3 higher average price of homes in backlog entering 2015 compared to backlog entering 2014 in addition the unit and average settlement price increases were favorably impacted by a 15 increase in new orders and a 2 increase in the average sales price of new orders respectively for the first six months of 2015 compared to the same period in 2014

the number of new orders and the average sales price of new orders increased 14 and 1 respectively in 2015 compared to 2014 new orders increased in 2015 despite a 3 decrease in the average number of active communities year over year due to more favorable market conditions in 2015 which led to a higher sales absorption rate in each of our market segments

gross profit margin percentage in 2015 increased to 187 from 184 in 2014 gross profit margin was favorably impacted in 2015 by an approximate 11100 or 22 basis points of revenue recovery of contract land deposits previously determined to be unrecoverable excluding the contract land deposit impairment recovery gross profit margin was flat year over year as higher revenues were offset by higher lot and construction costs year over year 

sga expenses in 2015 increased approximately 12300 or 3 compared to 2014 sga expenses increased primarily due to an approximate 14900 increase in management incentive compensation attributable to the improved operating results in 2015 sga expenses decreased as a percentage of revenue to 73 in 2015 from 82 in 2014 due to improved leveraging of sga expenses

backlog units and dollars increased approximately 14 to 6229 units and 13 to 2375182 respectively as of december 31 2015 compared to 5475 units and 2105635 respectively as of december 31 2014 the increase in backlog units was primarily attributable to a 13 increase in new orders for the six month period ended december 31 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 backlog dollars were favorably impacted by the increase in backlog units

reportable homebuilding segments 

homebuilding profit before tax includes all revenues and income generated from the sale of homes less the cost of homes sold sga expenses and a corporate capital allocation charge determined at the corporate headquarters the corporate capital allocation charge eliminates in consolidation and is based on the segment’s average net assets employed the corporate capital allocation charged to the operating segment allows the chief operating decision maker to determine whether the operating segment’s results are 

 

providing the desired rate of return after covering our cost of capital we record charges on contract land deposits when we determine that it is probable that recovery of the deposit is impaired for segment reporting purposes impairments on contra ct land deposits are generally charged to the operating segment upon the determination to terminate a l ot p urchase a greement with the developer or to restructure a l ot p urchase a greement resulting in the forfeiture of the deposit for presentation purposes below the contract land deposit reserve at december 31 2016 and 2015 has been allocated to the reportable segments for the respective years to show contract land deposits on a net basis the net contract land deposit balances below also include approxim ately  2  4 00 and  3000 at december 31 2016 and 2015  respectively of letters of credit issued as deposits in lieu of cash the following tables summarize certain homebuilding operating activity by reportable segment fo r each of the last three years

homebuilding segment reconciliations to consolidated homebuilding operations 

in addition to the corporate capital allocation and contract land deposit impairments discussed above the other reconciling items between homebuilding segment profit and homebuilding consolidated profit before tax include unallocated corporate overhead which includes all management incentive compensation equitybased compensation expense consolidation adjustments and external corporate interest expense our overhead functions such as accounting treasury and human resources are centrally performed and the costs are not allocated to our operating segments consolidation adjustments consist of such items to convert the reportable segments’ results which are predominantly maintained on a cash basis to a full accrual basis for external financial statement presentation purposes and are not allocated to our operating segments external corporate interest expense is primarily comprised of interest charges on our 395 senior notes due 2022 the “senior notes” and is not charged to the operating segments because the charges are included in the corporate capital allocation discussed above 

 



 



 





 

  



mortgage banking segment

we conduct our mortgage banking activity through nvrm a wholly owned subsidiary nvrm focuses almost exclusively on serving the homebuilding segment customer base the following table summarizes the results of our mortgage banking operations and certain statistical data for each of the last three years

 



2016 versus 2015 

loan closing volume in 2016 increased by approximately 460200 or 13 from 2015 the increase was primarily attributable to a 13 increase in the number of loans closed year over year due primarily to the aforementioned increase in the homebuilding segment’s number of settlements in 2016 as compared to 2015

segment profit in 2016 increased by approximately 12500 or 24 from 2015 the increase in segment profit was primarily attributable to an increase in mortgage banking fees partially offset by an increase in general and administrative expenses mortgage banking fees increased by approximately 19500 or 21 resulting from the aforementioned increase in loan closing volume and an increase in secondary marketing gains on sales of loans general and administrative expenses increased by approximately 8200 due primarily to an increase in compensation costs as a result of an increase in average headcount compared to 2015

2015 versus 2014 

loan closing volume in 2015 increased by approximately 658700 or 23 from 2014 the increase was primarily attributable to a 20 increase in the number of loans closed and a 3 increase in the average loan amount year over year the increase in the number of loans closed was primarily due to an increase in the homebuilding segment’s number of settlements in 2015 as compared to 2014 and an increase in the number of loans closed by nvrm for our homebuyers who obtain a mortgage to purchase the home the “capture rate” the capture rate increased from 84 in 2014 to 88 in 2015 the increase in the average loan amount is consistent with the homebuilding segment’s increase in average settlement price in 2015

 

segment profit in 2015 increased by approximately 20800 or 69 from 2014 the increase in segment profit was primarily attributable to an increase in mortgage banking fees partially offset by an increase in general and administrative expenses in 2015 compared to 2014  mortgage banking fees increased by approximately 24300 resulting from the increase in loan closing volume and higher rate lock commitments year over year  general and administrative expenses increased by approximately 5200 resulting primarily from an increase in man agement incentive compensation attributable to the improved operating results in 2015 compared to 2014  

mortgage banking – other

we sell all of the loans we originate into the secondary mortgage market insofar as we underwrite our originated loans to the standards and specifications of the ultimate investor we have no further financial obligations from the issuance of loans except in certain limited instances where early payment default occurs those underwriting standards are typically equal to or more stringent than the underwriting standards required by fnma va and fha because we sell all of our loans and do not service them there is often a substantial delay between the time that a loan goes into default and the time that the investor requests us to reimburse them for losses incurred because of the default we believe that all of the loans that we originate are underwritten to the standards and specifications of the ultimate investor to whom we sell our originated loans we employ a quality control department to ensure that our underwriting controls are effective and further assess the underwriting function as part of our assessment of internal controls over financial reporting

we maintain an allowance for losses on mortgage loans originated that reflects our judgment of the present loss exposure from the loans that we have originated and sold the allowance is calculated based on an analysis of historical experience and exposure at december 31 2016 we had an allowance for loan losses of approximately 12700 although we consider the allowance for loan losses reflected on the december 31 2016 balance sheet to be adequate there can be no assurance that this allowance will prove to be adequate to cover losses on loans previously originated

nvrm is dependent on our homebuilding operation’s customers for business if new orders and selling prices of the homebuilding segment decline nvrm’s operations will also be adversely affected in addition nvrm’s operating results may be adversely affected in future periods due to tightening and volatility of the credit markets changes in investor funding times increased regulation of mortgage lending practices and increased competition in the mortgage market

seasonality

we generally have higher new order activity in the first half of the year and higher home settlements revenues and net income in the second half of the year 

effective tax rate

our consolidated effective tax rate in 2016 2015 and 2014 was 3573 3652 and 3790 respectively during 2014 we recognized income tax expense of approximately 7000 due to the reversal of certain previously recognized tax deductions we expect our effective tax rate to be subject to increased volatility in 2017 due to our adoption of accounting standards update “asu” 201609 compensation – stock compensation  resulting from the change in recognition of the excess tax benefit from equity plan activity currently excess tax benefits from equity plan activity are recorded in equity whereas under asu 201609 these excess tax benefits will be recorded to income tax expense see additional discussion of asu 201609 in “recent accounting pronouncements pending adoption” below 

recent accounting pronouncements pending adoption 

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers  which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers the standard will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in gaap when it becomes effective in july 2015 the fasb delayed the standard’s effective date for one year the standard becomes effective for us on january 1 2018 the standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method we do not believe that the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures

in july 2015 fasb issued asu 201511 inventory topic 330 simplifying the measurement of inventory  the standard simplifies the subsequent measurement of inventory by requiring inventory to be measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value the amendments in the standard do not apply to inventory that is measured using lastin firstout lifo or the retail inventory method the standard became effective for us on january 1 2017 the amendments in the standard are to be applied prospectively we do not believe that the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures

 

in february 2016 fasb issued asu 201602 leases topic 842  which requires lessees to recognize most lea ses onbalance sheet with a liability equal to the present value of lease payments over the lease term and a rightofuse asset for the right to use the underlying asset over the lease term lessees will recognize expenses on their income statements in a manner similar to current gaap the standard also requires additional disclosures of key information about leasing arrangements the standard becomes effective for us on january 1 2019 we believe that the adoption of this standard will have a material e ffect on both assets and liabilities presented on the balance sheet and we are further evaluating the impact of its adoption 

in march 2016 fasb issued asu 201609 compensation – stock compensation topic 718 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting the standard simplifies several aspects of sharebased payment accounting including the recognition of income tax effects statutory tax withholding requirements and accounting for forfeitures the standard became effective for us on january 1 2017 we believe that the standard will likely have a material effect on net income and earnings per share presented on our consolidated financial statements resulting from the recognition of excess tax benefit from equity plan activity additionally we have elected to record forfeitures based on actual results which may result in increased volatility in the recognition of compensation expense

in june 2016 fasb issued asu 201613 financial instruments – credit losses topic 326  which significantly changes the way impairment of financial assets is recognized the standard will require immediate recognition of estimated credit losses expected to occur over the remaining life of many financial assets which will generally result in earlier recognition of allowances for credit losses on loans and other financial instruments the standard’s provisions will be applied as a cumulativeeffect adjustment to beginning retained earnings as of the effective date the standard becomes effective for us on january 1 2020 early adoption is permitted for annual and interim periods beginning january 1 2019 we are currently evaluating the effect that the standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures

in august 2016 fasb issued asu 201615 classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments  the objective of the standard is to address the diversity in practice of how certain cash receipts and payments are presented on the statement of cash flows the standard requires that the guidance be applied retrospectively in the first interim and annual periods in which an entity adopts the guidance the standard becomes effective for us on january 1 2018 and early adoption is permitted we are currently evaluating the effect that the standard will have on our consolidated statements of cash flows and related disclosures

in november 2016 fasb issued asu 201618 statement of cash flows topic 230 restricted cash  the amendments in the standard require that the statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash cash equivalents and restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents as a result restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginningofperiod and endofperiod total cash amounts shown on the statement of cash flows the standard becomes effective for us on january 1 2018 early adoption is permitted we do not believe that the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on our consolidated statements of cash flows and related disclosures

in january 2017 fasb issued asu 201704 intangibles – goodwill and other topic 350 simplifying the test for goodwill impairment  the standard’s objective is to simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating step 2 from the goodwill impairment test under the amendments in the standard an entity would perform its annual or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value an impairment charge would then be recognized not to exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit the standard becomes effective for us on january 1 2020 early adoption is permitted we do not believe that the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures

equity repurchases 

in addition to funding growth in our homebuilding and mortgage banking operations we historically have used a substantial portion of our excess liquidity to repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock in open market and privately negotiated transactions this ongoing repurchase activity is conducted pursuant to publicly announced board authorizations and is typically executed in accordance with the safeharbor provisions of rule 10b18 promulgated under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended in addition the board resolutions authorizing us to repurchase shares of our common stock specifically prohibit us from purchasing shares from our officers directors profit sharing plan trust or employee stock ownership plan trust the repurchase program assists us in accomplishing our primary objective creating increases in shareholder value see “market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities” in item 5 of this form 10k for disclosure of amounts repurchased during the fourth quarter of 2016 for the year ended december 31 2016 we repurchased 280288 shares of our common stock at an aggregate purchase price of 455351 as of december 31 2016 we had 183861 available under board approved repurchase authorizations

 

cash flows 

for the year ended december 31 2016 cash and cash equivalents decreased by 28697 net cash provided by operating activities was 384465 cash provided by earnings in 2016 was used to fund the increase in homebuilding inventory of 85194 as a result of an increase in units under construction at december 31 2016 compared to december 31 2015 and the increase of 32280 in contract land deposits cash was favorably impacted by an increase of 58532 in accounts payable and accrued expenses associated with the increase in homebuilding inventory and net proceeds of 49981 from mortgage loan activity net cash used in investing activities in 2016 of 9428 primarily included cash used for purchases of property plant and equipment of 22369 offset partially by the receipt of capital distributions from our unconsolidated jvs totaling 12594 net cash used in financing activities of 403734 was primarily impacted by our repurchase of 280288 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of 455351 under our ongoing common stock repurchase program as discussed above offset partially by 38106 in proceeds from stock option exercises and 13661 in realized excess income tax benefits from equitybased compensation plan activity

for the year ended december 31 2015 cash and cash equivalents decreased by 120103 net cash provided by operating activities was 203391 cash provided by earnings in 2015 was used to fund the increase in homebuilding inventory of 134803 as a result of an increase in units under construction at december 31 2015 compared to december 31 2014 and the increase of 37561in contract land deposits cash was favorably impacted by an increase of 55404 in accounts payable and accrued expenses associated with the increase in homebuilding inventory net cash used in investing activities in 2015 of 1022 included cash used for purchases of property plant and equipment of 18277 and investments in our unconsolidated jvs totaling 1917 these were partially offset by the receipt of capital distributions from our unconsolidated jvs totaling 18489 net cash used in financing activities was 322472 due primarily to our repurchase of 289687 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of 431367 offset partially by 85948 in proceeds from stock option exercises and 23311 in realized excess income tax benefits from equitybased compensation plan activity

for the year ended december 31 2014 cash and cash equivalents decreased by 320834 net cash provided by operating activities was 184549 cash was provided by homebuilding operations and net proceeds of 55830 from mortgage loan activity cash was used to fund the increase in homebuilding inventory of 127729 as a result of an increase in the number of units under construction at december 31 2014 compared to december 31 2013 cash was also used to fund the 57566 increase in contract land deposits year over year investing activities in 2014 used net cash of 19082 due primarily to the addition of 31672 in property plant and equipment offset partially by the receipt of 11569 of capital distributions from unconsolidated jvs net cash used in financing activities was 486301 due primarily to our repurchase of 507648 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of 567544 offset partially by 76153 in proceeds from stock option exercises

at december 31 2016 and 2015 the homebuilding segment had restricted cash of 17561 and 23440 respectively restricted cash in 2016 was attributable to customer deposits for certain home sales restricted cash in 2015 was attributable to holding requirements related to outstanding letters of credit issued under a letter of credit agreement and customer deposits for certain home sales 

we believe that our current cash holdings cash generated from operations and cash available under our shortterm unsecured credit agreement revolving mortgage repurchase facility and the public debt and equity markets will be sufficient to satisfy near and long term cash requirements for working capital and debt service in both our homebuilding and mortgage banking operations

offbalance sheet arrangements 

lot acquisition strategy

we generally do not engage in land development instead we typically acquire finished building lots at market prices from various land developers under lot purchase agreements that require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the agreement the deposits required under the lot purchase agreements are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percentage typically ranging up to 10 of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots 

we believe that our lot acquisition strategy reduces the financial requirements and risks associated with direct land ownership and land development we may at our option choose for any reason and at any time not to perform under these lot purchase agreements by delivering notice of our intent not to acquire the finished lots under contract our sole legal obligation and economic loss for failure to perform under these purchase agreements is limited to the amount of the deposit pursuant to the liquidated damage provision contained in the lot purchase agreements we do not have any financial guarantees or completion obligations and we typically do not guarantee lot purchases on a specific performance basis under these lot purchase agreements

at december 31 2016 we controlled approximately 78000 lots through lot purchase agreements jvs and land under development with an aggregate purchase price of approximately 7300000 these lots are controlled by making or committing to make deposits of approximately 493200 in the form of cash and letters of credit our entire risk of loss pertaining to the aggregate purchase price contractual commitment resulting from our nonperformance under the contracts is limited to 396200 in deposits paid and 2400 in letters of credit issued as of december 31 2016 plus approximately 94600 related to deposits to be paid subsequent to 

 

december 31 2016 assuming that contractual development milestones are met by the developers and we exercise our option and approxi mately 1500 in specific performance obligations see contractual obligations section below as of december 31 2016  we had recorded an impairment valuation allowance of approximately  31  3 00 related to certain cash deposits currently outstanding addit ionally as of december 31 2016  we had funding commitments totaling  6200 to three of our jv s and approximately  12000 under a joint development agreement related to our land under development a portion of which we expect will be offset by development credits of approximately  7100  

in addition  we have certain properties under contract with land owners that are expected to yield approximately 9600 lots which are not included in our number of total lots controlled above some of these properties may require rezoning or other approvals to achieve the expected yield these properties are controlled with cash deposits of approximately 14900 as of december 31 2016 of which approximately 1400 is refundable if we do not perform under the contract and the remainder is at risk of loss we generally expect to assign the raw land contracts to a land developer and simultaneously enter into a lot purchase agreement with the assignee if the project is determined to be feasible please refer to note 1 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of the contract land deposits and note 3 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of our lot acquisition strategy in relation to our accounting for variable interest entities

bonds and letters of credit

we enter into bond or letter of credit arrangements with local municipalities government agencies or land developers to collateralize our obligations under various contracts we had approximately 50700 of contingent obligations under such agreements as of december 31 2016 inclusive of the 2400 of lot acquisition deposits in the form of letters of credit discussed above we believe we will fulfill our obligations under the related contracts and do not anticipate any material losses under these bonds or letters of credit 

mortgage commitments and forward sales

in the normal course of business nvrm enters into contractual commitments to extend credit to buyers of singlefamily homes with fixed expiration dates the commitments become effective when the borrowers “lockin” a specified interest rate within time frames established by us all mortgagors are evaluated for credit worthiness prior to the extension of the commitment market risk arises if interest rates move adversely between the time of the “lockin” of rates by the borrower and the sale date of the loan to a brokerdealer to mitigate the effect of the interest rate risk inherent in providing rate lock commitments to borrowers we enter into optional or mandatory delivery forward sale contracts to sell whole loans and mortgagebacked securities to brokerdealers the forward sale contracts lock in an interest rate and price for the sale of loans similar to the specific rate lock commitments we do not engage in speculative or trading derivative activities both the rate lock commitments to borrowers and the forward sale contracts to brokerdealers are undesignated derivatives and accordingly are marked to fair value through earnings at december 31 2016 we had contractual commitments to extend credit to borrowers aggregating 458161 and open forward delivery contracts aggregating 738637 which hedge both the rate lock commitments and closed loans held for sale see note 14 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of our fair value accounting 

contractual obligations

our fixed noncancelable obligations as of december 31 2016 were as follows 

 



 







 



critical accounting policies

general

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods we continually evaluate the estimates we use to prepare the consolidated financial statements and update those estimates as necessary in general our estimates are based on historical experience on information from third party professionals and other various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances actual results could differ materially from those estimates made by management

homebuilding inventory 

the carrying value of inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market value cost of lots and completed and uncompleted housing units represent the accumulated actual cost of the units field construction supervisors’ salaries and related direct overhead expenses are included in inventory costs interest costs are not capitalized into inventory with the exception of land under development upon settlement the cost of the unit is expensed on a specific identification basis cost of building materials is determined on a firstin firstout basis

sold inventory is evaluated for impairment based on the contractual selling price compared to the total estimated cost to construct plus a reasonable profit margin unsold inventory is evaluated for impairment by analyzing recent comparable sale prices within the applicable community compared to the costs incurred to date plus the expected costs to complete and a reasonable profit margin any calculated impairments are recorded immediately in cost of sales beginning in 2017 with our adoption of asu 201511 inventory simplifying the measurement of inventory  which standardizes the definition of market value we will no longer include a reasonable profit margin in our inventory impairment analysis 

land under development and contract land deposits

land under development 

on a limited basis we directly acquire raw parcels of land already zoned for its intended use to develop into finished lots land under development includes the land acquisition costs direct improvement costs capitalized interest where applicable and real estate taxes

land under development including the land under development held by our unconsolidated jvs and the related joint venture investments is reviewed for potential writedowns when impairment indicators are present in addition to considering market and economic conditions we assess land under development impairments on a communitybycommunity basis analyzing as applicable current sales absorption levels recent sales’ direct profit and the dollar differential between the projected fullydeveloped cost of the lots and the current market price for lots if indicators of impairment are present for a community we perform an analysis to determine if the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts and if they are impairment charges are required to be recorded in an amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets our determination of fair value is primarily based on discounting the estimated future cash flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams

at december 31 2016 we had approximately 47000 in land under development in four separate communities in addition at december 31 2016 we had an aggregate investment totaling approximately 49400 in six separate jvs that controlled land under development none of the communities classified as land under development nor any of the undeveloped land held by the jvs had any indicators of impairment at december 31 2016 as such we do not believe that any of the land under development is impaired at this time however there can be no assurance that we will not incur impairment charges in the future due to unanticipated adverse changes in the economy or other events adversely affecting specific markets or the homebuilding industry 

contract land deposits 

we purchase finished lots under lot purchase agreements that require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the contract the deposits are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percentage of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots

we maintain an allowance for losses on contract land deposits that reflects our judgment of the present loss exposure in the existing contract land deposit portfolio at the end of the reporting period to analyze contract land deposit impairments we utilize a loss contingency analysis that is conducted each quarter in addition to considering market and economic conditions we assess 

 

contract land deposit impairments on a communitybycommunity basis pursuant to the purc hase contract terms analyzing as applicable current sales absorption levels recent sales’ direct profit the dollar differential between the contractual purchase price and the current market price for lots a developer’s financial stability a develope r’s financial ability or willingness to reduce lot prices to current market prices and the contract’s default status by either us or the developer along with an analysis of the expected outcome of any such default 

our analysis is focused on whether we can sell houses at an acceptable margin and sales pace in a particular community in the current market with which we are faced because we do not own the finished lots on which we had placed a contract land deposit if the above analysis leads to a determination that we cannot sell homes at an acceptable margin and sales pace at the current contractual lot price we then determine whether we will elect to default under the contract forfeit our deposit and terminate the contract or whether we will attempt to restructure the lot purchase contract which may require us to forfeit the deposit to obtain contract concessions from a developer we also assess whether an impairment is present due to collectability issues resulting from a developer’s nonperformance because of financial or other conditions 

although we consider the allowance for losses on contract land deposits reflected on the december 31 2016 consolidated balance sheet to be adequate see note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included herein there can be no assurance that this allowance will prove to be adequate over time to cover losses due to unanticipated adverse changes in the economy or other events adversely affecting specific markets or the homebuilding industry 

warrantyproduct liability accruals

warranty and product liability accruals are established to provide for estimated future costs as a result of construction and product defects product recalls and litigation incidental to our business liability estimates are determined based on our judgment considering such factors as historical experience the likely current cost of corrective action manufacturers’ and subcontractors’ participation in sharing the cost of corrective action consultations with third party experts such as engineers and evaluations by our general counsel and outside counsel retained to handle specific product liability cases although we consider the warranty and product liability accrual reflected on the december 31 2016 consolidated balance sheet to be adequate see note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included herein there can be no assurance that this accrual will prove to be adequate over time to cover losses due to increased costs for material and labor the inability or refusal of manufacturers or subcontractors to financially participate in corrective action unanticipated adverse legal settlements or other unanticipated changes to the assumptions used to estimate the warranty and product liability accrual

equitybased compensation expense 

compensation costs related to our equitybased compensation plans are recognized within our income statement the costs recognized are based on the grantdate fair value compensation cost for equitybased grants is recognized on a straightline basis over the requisite service period for the entire award from the date of grant through the period of the last separately vesting portion of the grant for the recognition of equitybased compensation expense the options which are subject to a performance condition are treated as a separate award from the “serviceonly” options and compensation expense is recognized when it becomes probable that the stated performance target will be achieved

we calculate the fair value of our nonpublicly traded employee options using the blackscholes optionpricing model while the blackscholes model is a widely accepted method to calculate the fair value of options its results are dependent on input variables two of which expected term and expected volatility are significantly dependent on management’s judgment we have concluded that our historical exercise experience is the best estimate of future exercise patterns to determine an option’s expected term to estimate expected volatility we analyze the historical volatility of our common stock over a period equal to the option’s expected term changes in management’s judgment of the expected term and the expected volatility could have a material effect on the grantdate fair value calculated and expensed within the income statement in addition we are required to estimate future grant forfeitures when considering the amount of stockbased compensation costs to record we have concluded that our historical forfeiture rate is the best measure to base our estimate of future forfeitures of equitybased compensation grants however there can be no assurance that our future forfeiture rate will not be materially higher or lower than our historical forfeiture rate which would affect the aggregate cumulative compensation expense recognized beginning in 2017 with our adoption of asu 201609 compensation  stock compensation  we will no longer estimate future grant forfeitures but will instead recognize grant forfeitures in the period in which they occur

in addition when recognizing stock based compensation cost related to “performance condition” option grants we are required to make a determination as to whether the performance conditions will be met prior to the completion of the actual performance period the performance metric is based on our return on capital performance during a specified three year period based on the date of option grant while we currently believe that this performance condition will be satisfied at the target level and are recognizing compensation expense related to such options accordingly our future expected activity levels could cause us to make a different determination resulting in a change to the compensation expense to be recognized related to performance condition option grants that would otherwise have been recognized to date 

 

although we believe that the compensation costs recognized in 201 6 are representative of the cumulative ratable amortization of the grantdate fai r value of unvested options outstanding and expected to be exercised changes to the estimated input values such as expected term and expected volatility and changes to the determination of whether performance condition grants will vest could produce wide ly different expense valuations and recognition  

mortgage loan loss allowance 

we originate several different loan products to our customers to finance the purchase of their home we sell all of the loans we originate into the secondary mortgage market generally within 30 days from origination all of the loans that we originate are underwritten to the standards and specifications of the ultimate investor insofar as we underwrite our originated loans to those standards we bear no increased concentration of credit risk from the issuance of loans except in certain limited instances where early payment default occurs those underwriting standards are typically equal to or more stringent than the underwriting standards required by fnma va and fha we employ a quality control department to ensure that our underwriting controls are effectively operating and further assess the underwriting function as part of our assessment of internal controls over financial reporting we maintain an allowance for losses on mortgage loans originated that reflects our judgment of the present loss exposure in the loans that we have originated and sold the allowance is calculated based on an analysis of historical experience and exposure although we consider the allowance for loan losses reflected on the december 31 2016 consolidated balance sheet to be adequate see note 15 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included herein there can be no assurance that this allowance will prove to be adequate over time to cover losses due to unanticipated changes to the assumptions used to estimate the mortgage loan loss allowance

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk

dollars in thousands

market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates our market risk arises from interest rate risk inherent in our financial instruments and debt obligations interest rate risk results from the possibility that changes in interest rates will cause unfavorable changes in net income or in the value of interest ratesensitive assets liabilities and commitments lower interest rates tend to increase demand for mortgage loans for home purchasers while higher interest rates make it more difficult for potential borrowers to purchase residential properties and to qualify for mortgage loans we have no market rate sensitive instruments held for speculative or trading purposes 

our homebuilding segment is exposed to interest rate risk as it relates to its debt obligations in september 2012 we issued 600000 of senior notes the senior notes mature on september 15 2022 and bear interest at 395 payable semiannually in arrears on march 15 and september 15 changes to interest rates generally affect the fair value of fixedrate debt instruments but not earnings or cash flows we generally have no obligation to prepay the senior notes prior to maturity and therefore interest rate fluctuations should not have a significant impact on our fixedrate debt 

in july 2016 we entered into a credit agreement which provides for aggregate revolving loan commitments of 200000 under the credit agreement we may request increases of up to 300000 to the facility in the form of revolving loan commitments or term loans to the extent that new or existing lenders agree to provide additional revolving loan or term loan commitments the credit agreement provides for a 100000 sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit of which there was approximately 8300 outstanding at december 31 2016 and a 25000 sublimit for a swing line commitment borrowings under the credit agreement generally bear interest for base rate loans at a base rate equal to the highest of i a federal funds rate plus onehalf of one percent ii bank of america’s publicly announced “prime rate” and iii the eurodollar rate plus one percent plus the applicable rate which is based on our debt rating or for eurodollar rate loans at the eurodollar rate equal to libor plus the applicable rate at december 31 2016 there was no debt outstanding under the facility

our mortgage banking segment is exposed to interest rate risk as it relates to its lending activities the mortgage banking segment originates mortgage loans which are sold through either optional or mandatory forward delivery contracts into the secondary markets all of the mortgage banking segment’s loan portfolio is held for sale and subject to forward sale commitments nvrm also sells all of its mortgages held for sale on a servicing released basis 

nvrm has available a mortgage repurchase agreement which as of december 31 2016 provided for loan repurchases up to 150000 with an incremental commitment pursuant to which nvrm may from time to time request increases in the total commitment available under the agreement by up to 50000 in the aggregate the repurchase agreement is used to fund nvrm’s 

 

mortgage origination activities advances under the repurchase agreement carry a pricing rate based on the libor rate plus the libor margin  as determined under the repurchase agreement provided that the pricing rate shall not be less than 2  25  at december 31 201 6  there was no debt outstanding unde r t he repurchase agreement 

the following table represents the contractual balances of our onbalance sheet financial instruments at the expected maturity dates as well as the fair values of those onbalance sheet financial instruments at december 31 2016 the expected maturity categories take into consideration the actual and anticipated amortization of principal and do not take into consideration the reinvestment of cash or the refinancing of existing indebtedness because we sell all of the mortgage loans we originate into the secondary markets we have made the assumption that the portfolio of mortgage loans held for sale will mature in the first year

business

general

nvr inc a virginia corporation was formed in 1980 as nvhomes inc our primary business is the construction and sale of singlefamily detached homes townhomes and condominium buildings all of which are primarily constructed on a presold basis to more fully serve customers of our homebuilding operations we also operate a mortgage banking and title services business we conduct our homebuilding activities directly our mortgage banking operations are operated primarily through a wholly owned subsidiary nvr mortgage finance inc “nvrm” unless the context otherwise requires references to “nvr” “we” “us” or “our” include nvr inc and its consolidated subsidiaries 

we are one of the largest homebuilders in the united states we operate in multiple locations in fourteen states and washington dc primarily in the eastern part of the united states during 2015 approximately 25 and 11 of our home settlements occurred in the washington dc and baltimore md metropolitan areas respectively which accounted for approximately 31 and 13 respectively of our 2015 homebuilding revenues our homebuilding operations include the construction and sale of singlefamily detached homes townhomes and condominium buildings under four trade names ryan homes nvhomes fox ridge homes and heartland homes the ryan homes and fox ridge homes products are marketed primarily to firsttime and firsttime moveup buyers ryan homes operates in twentyeight metropolitan areas located in maryland virginia washington dc west virginia pennsylvania new york north carolina south carolina florida ohio new jersey delaware indiana illinois and tennessee fox ridge homes operates in the nashville tn metropolitan area the nvhomes and heartland homes products are marketed primarily to moveup and upscale buyers nvhomes operates in delaware and the washington dc baltimore md philadelphia pa and raleigh nc metropolitan areas heartland homes operates in the pittsburgh pa metropolitan area in 2015 our average price of a settled unit was approximately 379900 

we generally do not engage in land development see discussion below on our limited land development activities instead we typically acquire finished building lots at market prices from various development entities under fixed price purchase agreements “purchase agreements” that require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the purchase agreements the deposits required under the purchase agreements are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percentage typically ranging up to 10 of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots 

we believe that our lot acquisition strategy avoids the financial requirements and risks associated with direct land ownership and land development we may at our option choose for any reason and at any time not to perform under these purchase agreements by delivering notice of our intent not to acquire the finished lots under contract our sole legal obligation and economic loss for failure to perform under these purchase agreements is limited to the amount of the deposit pursuant to the liquidated damage provision contained within the purchase agreements we do not have any financial guarantees or completion obligations and we typically do not guarantee lot purchases on a specific performance basis under these purchase agreements none of the creditors of any of the development entities with which we have entered these purchase agreements have recourse to our general credit we generally seek to maintain control over a supply of lots believed to be suitable to meet our fiveyear business plan 

in addition to constructing homes primarily on a presold basis and utilizing what we believe is a conservative lot acquisition strategy we focus on obtaining and maintaining a leading market position in each market we serve this strategy allows us to gain valuable efficiencies and competitive advantages in our markets which we believe contributes to minimizing the adverse effects of regional economic cycles and provides growth opportunities within these markets our continued success is contingent upon our ability to control an adequate supply of finished lots on which to build as a result in certain specific strategic circumstances we deviate from our historical lot acquisition strategy and engage in joint venture arrangements with land developers or directly acquire raw ground already zoned for its intended use for development once we acquire control of any raw ground we determine whether to sell the raw parcel to a developer and enter into a purchase agreement with the developer to purchase the finished lots or whether to hire a developer to develop the land on our behalf while joint venture arrangements and direct land development activity are not our preferred method of acquiring finished building lots we may enter into additional transactions in the future on a limited basis where there exists a compelling strategic or prudent financial reason to do so we expect however to continue to acquire substantially all of our finished lot inventory using purchase agreements with forfeitable deposits

as of december 31 2015 we controlled approximately 68800 lots under purchase agreements with deposits in cash and letters of credit totaling approximately 3733 million and 30 million respectively included in the number of controlled lots are approximately 6100 lots for which we have recorded a contract land deposit impairment reserve of approximately 422 million as of december 31 2015 in addition we controlled approximately 8000 lots through six jvs with an aggregate investment of approximately 605 million of the lots controlled by the jvs approximately 3300 were not under contract with us at december 31 2015 further as of december 31 2015 we directly owned four separate raw parcels of land zoned for their intended use with a current cost basis including development costs of approximately 606 million that we intend to develop into approximately 980 finished lots see notes 3 4 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information regarding fixed 

 

price purchase agreements jvs and land under development respectively in a ddition to the lots we cur rently control as discussed above we have certain properties under contract with land owners that are expected to yield approximately 8800 lots some of these properties may require rezoning or other approvals to achieve the expected yield these proper ties are controlled with deposits and letters of credit totaling approximately 122 million and 350000 respectively as of december 31 2015 of which approximately 87 million is refundable if we do not perform under the contract we generally expect to assign the raw land contracts to a land developer and simultaneously enter into a lot purchase agreement with the assignee if the project is determined to be feasible in february 2016 we acquired one of these properties at a cost of approximately 15 0 million which is expected to produce approximately 1000 lots  of which approximately 160 lots are under co ntract with unrelated parties 

in addition to building and selling homes we provide a number of mortgagerelated services through our mortgage banking operations through operations in each of our homebuilding markets nvrm originates mortgage loans almost exclusively for our homebuyers nvrm generates revenues primarily from origination fees gains on sales of loans and title fees nvrm sells all of the mortgage loans it closes into the secondary markets on a servicing released basis 

segment information for our homebuilding and mortgage banking businesses is included in note 2 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

current business environment

new home demand continued to improve throughout 2015 however new home prices continued to be constrained due to an increase in the number of new home communities in many markets the housing market also continues to face challenges from tight mortgage underwriting standards we believe that a continuation of the housing market recovery is dependent upon a sustained overall economic recovery driven by continued improvement in job and wage growth and household formation for additional information and analysis of recent trends in our operations and financial condition see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 of this form 10k

homebuilding 

products

we offer singlefamily detached homes townhomes and condominium buildings with many different basic home designs these home designs have a variety of elevations and numerous other options our homes combine traditional transitional cottage or urban exterior designs with contemporary interior designs and amenities generally include two to four bedrooms and range from approximately 1000 to 7000 square feet during 2015 the prices at which we settled homes ranged from approximately 136000 to 19 million and averaged approximately 379900 during 2014 our average price was approximately 368500

markets

our four reportable homebuilding segments operate in the following geographic regions

 



backlog

backlog totaled 6229 units and approximately 24 billion at december 31 2015 compared to backlog of 5475 units and approximately 21 billion at december 31 2014 backlog which represents homes sold but not yet settled with the customer may be impacted by customer cancellations for various reasons that are beyond our control such as the customer’s failure to obtain mortgage financing inability to sell an existing home job loss or a variety of other reasons in any period a portion of the cancellations that we experience are related to new sales that occurred during the same period and a portion are related to sales that occurred in prior periods and therefore appeared in the opening backlog for the current period expressed as the total of all cancellations during the period as a percentage of gross sales during the period our cancellation rate was approximately 15 in each of 2015 2014 and 2013 additionally during each of 2015 2014 and 2013 approximately 6 of a reporting quarter’s opening backlog balance cancelled during the fiscal quarter we can provide no assurance that our historical cancellation rates are indicative of the actual cancellation rate that may occur in future periods other than those units that are cancelled we expect to settle substantially all of our december 31 2015 backlog during 2016 see “risk factors” in item 1a and “seasonality” in item 7 of this form 10k

further discussion of settlements new orders and backlog activity by our homebuilding reportable segment for each of the last three years can be found in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 of this form 10k

 

construction 

we utilize independent subcontractors under fixed price contracts to perform construction work on our homes we use several independent subcontractors in our various markets and we are not dependent on any single subcontractor or on a small number of subcontractors

sales and marketing

our preferred marketing method is for customers to visit a furnished model home featuring many builtin options and a landscaped lot the garages of these model homes are usually converted into temporary sales centers where alternative facades and floor plans are displayed and designs for other models are available for review sales representatives are compensated predominantly on a commission basis

regulation

we and our subcontractors must comply with various federal state and local zoning building environmental advertising and consumer credit statutes rules and regulations as well as other regulations and requirements in connection with our construction and sales activities all of these regulations have increased the cost to produce and market our products and in some instances have delayed our developers’ ability to deliver finished lots to us counties and cities in which we build homes have at times declared moratoriums on the issuance of building permits and imposed other restrictions in the areas in which sewage treatment facilities and other public facilities do not reach minimum standards in addition our homebuilding operations are regulated in certain areas by restrictive zoning and density requirements that limit the number of homes that can be built within the boundaries of a particular area to date restrictive zoning laws and the imposition of moratoriums have not had a material adverse effect on our construction activities

competition and market factors

the housing industry is highly competitive we compete with numerous homebuilders of varying size ranging from local to national in scope some of which have greater financial resources than we do we also face competition from the home resale market our homebuilding operations compete primarily on the basis of price location design quality service and reputation historically we have been one of the market leaders in each of the markets where we build homes 

the housing industry is cyclical and is affected by consumer confidence levels prevailing economic conditions and interest rates other factors that affect the housing industry and the demand for new homes include the availability and the cost of land labor and materials changes in consumer preferences demographic trends and the availability of mortgage finance programs see “risk factors” in item 1a of this form 10k for additional information regarding these risks

we are dependent upon building material suppliers for a continuous flow of raw materials whenever possible we utilize standard products available from multiple sources in the past such raw materials have been generally available to us in adequate supply

mortgage banking 

we provide a number of mortgage related services to our homebuilding customers through our mortgage banking operations our mortgage banking operations also include separate subsidiaries that broker title insurance and perform title searches in connection with mortgage loan closings for which they receive commissions and fees because nvrm originates mortgage loans almost exclusively for our homebuilding customers nvrm is dependent on our homebuilding segment in 2015 nvrm closed approximately 10900 loans with an aggregate principal amount of approximately 35 billion as compared to approximately 9100 loans with an aggregate principal amount of approximately 28 billion in 2014

nvrm sells all of the mortgage loans it closes to investors in the secondary markets on a servicing released basis typically within 30 days from the loan closing nvrm is an approved sellerservicer for fannie mae “fnma” mortgage loans and an approved sellerissuer of ginnie mae “gnma” freddie mac “fhlmc” department of veterans affairs “va” and federal housing administration “fha” mortgage loans

regulation

nvrm is an approved sellerservicer of fnma mortgage loans and an approved sellerissuer of gnma fhlmc va and fha mortgage loans and is subject to all of those agencies’ rules and regulations these rules and regulations restrict certain activities of nvrm nvrm is currently eligible and expects to remain eligible to participate in such programs in addition nvrm is subject to regulation at the state and federal level including regulations issued by the consumer financial protection bureau the “cfpb” with respect to specific origination selling and servicing practices

 

competition and market factors 

nvrm’s main competition comes from national regional and local mortgage bankers mortgage brokers credit unions and banks in each of these markets nvrm competes primarily on the basis of customer service variety of products offered interest rates offered prices of ancillary services and relative financing availability and costs

pipeline

nvrm’s mortgage loans in process that had not closed at december 31 2015 and 2014 had an aggregate principal balance of approximately 16 billion and 14 billion respectively nvrm’s cancellation rate was approximately 29 31 and 35 in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively we can provide no assurance that our historical loan cancellation rates are indicative of the actual loan cancellation rate that may occur in future periods see “risk factors” in item 1a in this form 10k for additional information about factors that could increase our cancellation rate

employees

at december 31 2015 we employed approximately 4300 fulltime persons none of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement and we have never experienced a work stoppage we believe that our employee relations are good

risk factors  

tableend

our business is affected by the risks generally incident to the residential construction business including but not limited to 











all of these risks are discussed in detail below 

an economic downturn or decline in economic conditions could adversely affect our business and our results of operations 

demand for new homes is sensitive to economic changes driven by conditions such as employment levels job growth consumer confidence and interest rates if the housing industry suffers a downturn our sales may decline which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

interest rate movements inflation and other economic factors can negatively impact our business 

high rates of inflation generally affect the homebuilding industry adversely because of their adverse impact on interest rates high interest rates not only increase the cost of borrowed funds to homebuilders but also have a significant adverse effect on housing demand and on the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective purchasers we are also subject to potential volatility in the price of commodities that impact costs of materials used in our homebuilding business increases in prevailing interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows

our financial results also are affected by the risks generally incident to our mortgage banking business including interest rate levels the impact of government regulation on mortgage loan originations and servicing and the need to issue forward commitments to fund and sell mortgage loans our homebuilding customers account for almost all of our mortgage banking business the volume of our continuing homebuilding operations therefore affects our mortgage banking business

our mortgage banking business also is affected by interest rate fluctuations we also may experience marketing losses resulting from daily increases in interest rates to the extent we are unable to match interest rates and amounts on loans we have committed to originate with forward commitments from third parties to purchase such loans increases in interest rates may have a material adverse effect on our mortgage banking revenue profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows

our operations may also be adversely affected by other economic factors within our markets such as negative changes in employment levels job growth wage growth consumer confidence and household formation and availability of mortgage financing one or all of which could result in reduced demand or price depression from current levels such negative trends could have a material adverse effect on homebuilding operations

these factors and thus the homebuilding business have at times in the past been cyclical in nature any downturn in the national economy or the local economies of the markets in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations in particular during 2015 approximately 25 and 11 of our home settlements occurred in the washington dc and baltimore md metropolitan areas respectively which accounted for approximately 31 and 13 respectively of our 2015 homebuilding revenues thus we are dependent to a significant extent on the economy and demand for housing in those areas

because almost all of our customers require mortgage financing the availability of suitable mortgage financing could impair the affordability of our homes lower demand for our products and limit our ability to fully deliver our backlog 

our business and earnings depend on the ability of our potential customers to obtain mortgages for the purchase of our homes in addition many of our potential customers must sell their existing homes in order to buy a home from us the tightening of credit standards and the availability of suitable mortgage financing could prevent customers from buying our homes and could prevent buyers of our customers’ homes from obtaining mortgages they need to complete that purchase either of which could result in our potential customers’ inability to buy a home from us if our potential customers or the buyers of our customers’ current homes are not able to obtain suitable financing the result could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

if our ability to sell mortgages to investors is impaired we may be required to fund these commitments ourselves or may not be able to originate loans at all 

 

our mortgage banking business sells all of the loans it originates into the secondary market usually within 30 days from the date of closing and has up to approximately 150 million available under a repurchase agreement to fun d mortgage closings see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – liquidity and capital resources” in item 7 of this form 10k for more information about the repurchase agreement in the event that disruption s to the secondary markets tighten or eliminate the available liquidity within the secondary markets for mortgage loans or the underwriting requirements by our secondary market investors continue to become more stringent our ability to sell future mortga ges could decline and we could be required among other things to fund our commitments to our buyers with our own financial resources which is limited or require our home buyers to find another source of financing the result of such secondary market di sruption could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

if the market value of our inventory or controlled lot position declines our profit could decrease and we may incur losses 

inventory risk can be substantial for homebuilders the market value of building lots and housing inventories can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing market conditions in addition inventory carrying costs can be significant and can result in losses in a poorly performing project or market we must in the ordinary course of our business continuously seek and make acquisitions of lots for expansion into new markets as well as for replacement and expansion within our current markets which is generally accomplished by us entering fixed price purchase agreements and paying forfeitable deposits under the purchase agreements to developers for the contractual right to acquire the lots in the event of adverse changes in economic or market conditions we may cease further building activities in certain communities or restructure existing purchase agreements resulting in forfeiture of some or all of any remaining land contract deposit paid to the developer we may also have significant impairments of land under development the forfeiture of land contract deposits or inventory impairments may result in a loss that could have a material adverse effect on our profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

if the underwriting quality of our mortgage originations is found to be deficient our profit could decrease and we may incur losses 

we originate several different loan products to our customers to finance the purchase of their home we sell all of the loans we originate into the secondary mortgage market generally within 30 days from origination all of the loans that we originate are underwritten to the standards and specifications of the ultimate investor insofar as we underwrite our originated loans to those standards we bear no increased concentration of credit risk from the issuance of loans except in certain limited instances where early payment default occurs in the event that a substantial number of the loans that we have originated fall into default and the investors to whom we sold the loans determine that we did not underwrite the loans in accordance with their requirements we could be required to repurchase the loans from the investor or indemnify the investor for any losses incurred any resulting losses could have a material adverse effect on our profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows

we may be subject to claims on mortgage loans sold to third parties 

our mortgage banking operations may be responsible for losses associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to investors in the event of errors or omissions relating to certain representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements including representations as to underwriting standards the type of collateral the existence of primary mortgage insurance and the validity of certain borrower representations in connection with the loan the resolution of claims related to alleged breaches of these representations and warranties and repurchase claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition cash flows and results of operations and could result in losses that exceed existing estimates and accruals because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating these matters there can be no assurance that any amounts reserved will be adequate or that any potential inadequacies will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our inability to secure and control an adequate inventory of lots could adversely impact our operations

the results of our homebuilding operations depend upon our continuing ability to control an adequate number of homebuilding lots in desirable locations there can be no assurance that an adequate supply of building lots will continue to be available to us on terms similar to those available in the past or that we will not be required to devote a greater amount of capital to controlling building lots than we have historically an insufficient supply of building lots in one or more of our markets an inability of our developers to deliver finished lots in a timely fashion due to their inability to secure financing to fund development activities or for other reasons or our inability to purchase or finance building lots on reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows

volatility in the credit and capital markets may impact our ability to access necessary financing

if we require working capital greater than our operations provide we may be required to obtain alternative financing which might not be available on terms that are favorable or acceptable if we are required to seek financing to fund our working capital requirements volatility in credit or capital markets may restrict our flexibility to access financing if we are at any time unsuccessful in obtaining sufficient capital to fund our planned homebuilding expenditures we may experience a substantial delay in the 

 

completion of homes then under construction or we may be unable to control or purchase finished building lots any delay could result in cost increases and could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

our mortgage banking operations depend in part on the availability cost and other terms of mortgage financing facilities and may be adversely affected by any shortage or increased cost of such financing additional or replacement financing might not be available on terms that are favorable or acceptable our mortgage banking operations are also dependent upon the securitization market for mortgagebacked securities and could be materially adversely affected by any fluctuation or downturn in such market 

our current indebtedness may impact our future operations

our existing indebtedness contains restrictive covenants and any future indebtedness may also contain such covenants these covenants include or could include restrictions on our ability to create incur assume or guarantee secured debt enter into sale and leaseback transactions and conditions related to mergers andor the sale of assets substantial losses by us or other action or inaction by us or our subsidiaries could result in the violation of one or more of these covenants which could result in decreased liquidity or a default on our current or future indebtedness thereby having a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows

government regulations and environmental matters could negatively affect our operations 

we are subject to various local state and federal statutes ordinances rules and regulations concerning zoning building design construction and similar matters including local regulations that impose restrictive zoning and density requirements in order to limit the number of homes that can eventually be built within the boundaries of a particular area these regulations may further increase the cost to produce and market our products in addition we have from time to time been subject to and may also be subject in the future to periodic delays in our homebuilding projects due to building moratoriums in the areas in which we operate or delays in receiving the necessary governmental approvals changes in regulations that restrict homebuilding activities in one or more of our principal markets could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

in addition new housing developments are often subject to various assessments or impact fees for schools parks streets highways and other public improvements the cost of these assessments is subject to substantial change and could cause increases in the construction cost of our homes which in turn could reduce our profitability 

we are also subject to a variety of local state and federal statutes ordinances rules and regulations concerning the protection of health and the environment we are subject to a variety of environmental conditions that can affect our business and our homebuilding projects the particular environmental laws that apply to any given homebuilding site vary greatly according to the location and environmental condition of the site and the present and former uses of the site and adjoining properties environmental laws and conditions may result in delays cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs or prohibit or severely restrict homebuilding activity in certain environmentally sensitive regions or areas thereby adversely affecting our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows

increased regulation of the mortgage industry could harm our future sales and earnings 

the mortgage industry remains under intense scrutiny and continues to face increasing regulation at the federal state and local level potential changes to federal laws and regulations could have the effect of limiting the activities of fnma and fhlmc the entities that provide liquidity to the secondary mortgage market which could lead to increases in mortgage interest rates tighter underwriting requirements and fee restrictions and the increasingly complex regulatory environment may negatively impact our mortgage loan origination business in the form of lower demand decreased revenue and increased operating costs 

we are an approved sellerservicer of fnma mortgage loans and an approved sellerissuer of gnma fhlmc va and fha mortgage loans and are subject to all of those agencies’ rules and regulations any significant impairment of our eligibility to sellservice these loans could have a material adverse impact on our mortgage operations in addition we are subject to regulation at the state and federal level with respect to specific origination selling and servicing practices including the real estate settlement and protection act adverse changes in governmental regulation may have a negative impact on our mortgage loan origination business

we face competition in our homebuilding and mortgage banking operations 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive we compete with numerous homebuilders of varying size ranging from local to national in scope some of whom have greater financial resources than we do we face competition 







 

our homebuilding operations com pete primarily on the basis of price location design quality service and reputation 

the mortgage banking industry is also competitive our main competition comes from national regional and local mortgage bankers credit unions banks and mortgage brokers in each of these markets our mortgage banking operations compete primarily on the basis of customer service variety of products offered interest rates offered prices of ancillary services and relative financing availability and costs 

we might not be able to continue to compete successfully in our homebuilding or mortgage banking operations an inability to effectively compete may have an adverse impact on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

a shortage of building materials or labor or increases in materials or labor costs may adversely impact our operations 

the homebuilding business has from time to time experienced building material and labor shortages including shortages in insulation drywall certain carpentry work and concrete as well as fluctuating lumber prices and supply in addition strong construction market conditions could restrict the labor force available to our subcontractors and us in one or more of our markets significant increases in costs resulting from these shortages or delays in construction of homes could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

we rely on subcontractors to construct our homes the failure of our subcontractors to properly construct our homes may be costly 

we engage subcontractors to perform the actual construction of our homes despite our quality control efforts we may discover that our subcontractors have engaged in improper construction practices the occurrence of such events could require us to repair the homes in accordance with our standards and as required by law the cost of satisfying our legal obligations in these instances may be significant and we may be unable to recover the cost of repair from subcontractors suppliers and insurers 

product liability litigation and warranty claims may adversely impact our operations 

construction defect and home warranty claims are common and can represent a substantial risk for the homebuilding industry the cost of insuring against construction defect and product liability claims as well as the claims themselves can be high in addition insurance companies limit coverage offered to protect against these claims further restrictions on coverage availability or significant increases in premium costs or claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial results

results of operations for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 

overview 

business 

our primary business is the construction and sale of singlefamily detached homes townhomes and condominium buildings all of which are primarily constructed on a presold basis to fully serve customers of our homebuilding operations we also operate a mortgage banking and title services business we primarily conduct our operations in mature markets additionally we generally grow our business through market share gains in our existing markets and by expanding into markets contiguous to our current active markets our four homebuilding reportable segments consist of the following regions 

 



 

our lot acquisition strategy is predicated upon avoiding the financial requirements and risks associated with direct land ownership and development we generally do not engage in land development see discussion below of our limited land development activi ties instead we typically have acquired finished lots at market prices from various third party land developers pursuant to fixed price purchase agreements these purchase agreements require deposits typically ranging up to 10 of the aggregate purchas e price of the finished lots in the form of cash or letters of credit that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the purchase agreement this strategy has allowed us to maximize inventory turnover which we believe enables us to minimize market ris k and to operate with less capital thereby enhancing rates of return on equity and total capital 

in addition to constructing homes primarily on a presold basis and utilizing what we believe is a conservative lot acquisition strategy we focus on obtaining and maintaining a leading market position in each market we serve this strategy allows us to gain valuable efficiencies and competitive advantages in our markets which we believe contributes to minimizing the adverse effects of regional economic cycles and provides growth opportunities within these markets our continued success is contingent upon our ability to control an adequate supply of finished lots on which to build 

in certain specific strategic circumstances we deviate from our historical lot acquisition strategy and engage in joint venture arrangements with land developers or directly acquire raw ground already zoned for its intended use for development once we acquire control of any raw ground we determine whether to sell the raw parcel to a developer and enter into a fixed price purchase agreement with the developer to purchase the finished lots or to hire a developer to develop the land on our behalf while joint venture arrangements and direct land development activity are not our preferred method of acquiring finished building lots we may enter into additional transactions in the future on a limited basis where there exists a compelling strategic or prudent financial reason to do so we expect however to continue to acquire substantially all of our finished lot inventory using fixed price purchase agreements with forfeitable deposits

as of december 31 2015 we controlled approximately 68800 lots under purchase agreements with deposits in cash and letters of credit totaling approximately 373300 and 3000 respectively included in the number of controlled lots are approximately 6100 lots for which we have recorded a contract land deposit impairment reserve of approximately 42200 as of december 31 2015 in addition we controlled approximately 8000 lots through six jvs with an aggregate investment of approximately 60500 of the lots controlled by the jvs approximately 3300 were not under contract with us at december 31 2015 further as of december 31 2015 we directly owned four separate raw parcels of land zoned for their intended use with a current cost basis including development costs of approximately 60600 that we intend to develop into approximately 980 finished lots we have additional funding commitments under a joint development agreement related to our land under development of approximately 19200 a portion of which we expect will be offset by development credits of approximately 9600 we also had a 2200 obligation under a letter of credit related to one of our land parcels in february 2016 we acquired an additional raw parcel of land at a cost of approximately 150000 which is expected to produce approximately 1000 lots of which approximately 160 lots are under contract with unrelated parties see notes 3 4 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information regarding fixed price purchase agreements jvs and land under development respectively

in a ddition to the lots we currently control as discussed above we have certain properties under contract with land owners that are expected to yield approximately 8800 lots some of these properties may require rezoning or other approvals to achieve the expected yield these properties are controlled with cash deposits and letters of credit totaling approximately 12200 and 350 respectively as of december 31 2015 of which approximately 8700 is refundable if we do not perform under the contract of the 12200 in cash deposits 5000 relates to the raw parcel of land acquired in february 2016 discussed above we generally expect to assign the raw land contracts to a land developer and simultaneously enter into a lot purchase agreement with the assignee if the project is determined to be feasible 

current business environment and key financial results 

new home demand continued to improve throughout 2015 however new home prices continued to be constrained by an increase in the number of new home communities in many markets the housing market also continues to face challenges from tight mortgage underwriting standards

our consolidated revenues for the year ended december 31 2015 totaled 5159008 an increase of 16 from 4444568 in 2014 our net income for 2015 was 382927 or 8999 per diluted share increases of 36 and 42 compared to 2014 net income and diluted earnings per share respectively diluted earnings per share was favorably impacted by our ongoing share repurchase program our homebuilding gross profit margin percentage increased to187 in 2015 from 184 in 2014 new orders net of cancellations “new orders” during 2015 increased 14 from 2014 while our average new order sales price increased 1 to 3787 in 2015 our backlog of homes sold but not yet settled with the customer as of december 31 2015 increased on a unit basis by 14 to 6229 units and increased on a dollar basis by 13 to 2375182 when compared to december 31 2014

we believe that a continuation of the housing market recovery is dependent upon a sustained overall economic recovery driven by continued improvement in job and wage growth and household formation we expect to continue to face gross profit margin and pricing pressures due to higher land and construction costs as well as increased competition associated with the increase in the 

 

number of new home communities in our markets we believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities that may arise from future economic and homebuilding market volatility due to the strength of our balance sh eet 

homebuilding operations 

the following table summarizes the results of our consolidated homebuilding operations and certain operating activity for each of the last three years 

 



consolidated homebuilding revenues 

homebuilding revenues increased 16 in 2015 compared 2014 as a result of a 12 increase in the number of units settled and a 3 increase in the average settlement price year over year units settled and the average settlement prices were higher in each of our market segments year over year the increases in the number of units settled and the average settlement price were attributable to an 11 higher backlog unit balance entering 2015 and a 3 higher average price of homes in backlog entering 2015 compared to backlog entering 2014 in addition the unit and average settlement price increases were favorably impacted by a 15 increase in new orders and a 2 increase in the average sales price of new orders respectively for the first six months of 2015 compared to the same period in 2014

homebuilding revenues increased 6 in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily as a result of a 6 increase in the average settlement price while the number of units settled was flat year over year the increase in the average settlement price was primarily attributable to the average price of homes in backlog being approximately 8 higher entering 2014 compared to 2013 and a 5 higher average sales price of new orders for the first six months of 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 the higher average price of homes in backlog entering 2014 was attributable to favorable market conditions in 2013 leading to increasing prices during that year

consolidated homebuilding new orders 

the number of new orders and the average sales price of new orders increased 14 and 1 respectively in 2015 compared to 2014 new orders increased in 2015 despite a 3 decrease in the average number of active communities year over year due to more favorable market conditions in 2015 which led to higher sales absorption in each of our market segments

the number of new orders and the average sales price of new orders increased 5 and 4 respectively in 2014 compared to 2013 new orders were higher due to the 8 increase in the average number of active communities year over year offset partially by lower sales absorption rates in many of our markets average sales prices were higher in each of our market segments year over year as a result of favorable market conditions in 2013 which led to higher prices entering 2014

consolidated homebuilding gross profit 

gross profit margin percentage in 2015 increased to 187 from 184 in 2014 gross profit margin was favorably impacted in 2015 by an approximate 11100 or 22 basis points of revenue recovery of contract land deposits previously determined to be unrecoverable excluding the contract land deposit impairment recovery gross profit margin was flat year over year as higher revenues were offset by higher lot and construction costs year over year we expect continued gross margin pressure over the next several quarters due to weakness in sales pricing

gross profit margin percentage in 2014 increased to 184 compared to 172 in 2013 gross profit margins were favorably impacted by our average settlement prices increasing at a higher rate than material and lot costs year over year as well as by a relative shift in settlements to our midatlantic and north east segments which have higher average gross profit margins gross profit 

 

margins in 2013 were negatively impacted by two service related accruals which reduced the 2013 gross profit margin by 76 basis points 

consolidated homebuilding selling general and administrative “sga”

sga expenses in 2015 increased approximately 12300 or 3 compared to 2014 sga expenses increased primarily due to an approximate 14900 increase in management incentive compensation attributable to the improved operating results in 2015 sga expenses decreased as a percentage of revenue to 73 in 2015 from 82 in 2014 due to improved leveraging of sga expenses

sga expenses in 2014 increased approximately 45800 or 15 compared to 2013 and increased as a percentage of revenue to 82 from 76 year over year the increase in sga expenses was attributable to an approximate 26000 increase in equitybased compensation expense and an approximate 14100 increase in sales and marketing expenses in 2014 equitybased compensation expense increased primarily due to the grant of nonqualified stock options “options” under the 2014 equity incentive plan the “2014 plan” following shareholder approval of the 2014 plan in may 2014 and restricted share units “rsus” in the second quarter of 2013 in addition in 2013 we recorded a reversal of approximately 7100 in equitybased compensation expense as a result of an adjustment to our stock option forfeiture rates based on our actual forfeiture experience sales and marketing expenses increased due primarily to an increase in model home expenditures attributable to the 8 increase in the number of active communities year over year

consolidated homebuilding backlog 

backlog units and dollars increased approximately 14 to 6229 units and 13 to 2375182 respectively as of december 31 2015 compared to 5475 units and 2105635 respectively as of december 31 2014 the increase in backlog units was primarily attributable to a 13 increase in new orders for the six month period ended december 31 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 backlog dollars were favorably impacted by the increase in backlog units

backlog units and dollars increased approximately 11 to 5475 units and 14 to 2105635 respectively as of december 31 2014 compared to 4945 units and 1845600 respectively as of december 31 2013 backlog units were higher primarily due to a 13 increase in new orders for the six month period ended december 31 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 backlog dollars were favorably impacted by the 11 increase in the backlog unit balance and a 3 higher average price of homes in backlog year over year the average price of homes in backlog was favorably impacted by a 2 increase in the average sales price of new orders for the six month period ended december 31 2014 compared to the same period in 2013

backlog which represents homes sold but not yet settled with the customer may be impacted by customer cancellations for various reasons that are beyond our control such as failure to obtain mortgage financing inability to sell an existing home job loss or a variety of other reasons in any period a portion of the cancellations that we experience are related to new sales that occurred during the same period and a portion are related to sales that occurred in prior periods and therefore appeared in the beginning backlog for the current period expressed as the total of all cancellations during the period as a percentage of gross sales during the period our cancellation rate was approximately 15 in each of 2015 2014 and 2013 additionally during each of 2015 2014 and 2013 approximately 6 of a reporting quarter’s opening backlog cancelled during the fiscal quarter we can provide no assurance that our historical cancellation rates are indicative of the actual cancellation rate that may occur in future years other than those units that are cancelled we expect to settle substantially all of our december 31 2015 backlog during 2016 see “risk factors” in item 1a of this form 10k

the backlog turnover rate is impacted by various factors including but not limited to changes in new order activity internal production capacity external subcontractor capacity and other external factors over which we do not exercise control

reportable homebuilding segments 

homebuilding profit before tax includes all revenues and income generated from the sale of homes less the cost of homes sold sga expenses and a corporate capital allocation charge determined at the corporate headquarters the corporate capital allocation charge eliminates in consolidation and is based on the segment’s average net assets employed the corporate capital allocation charged to the operating segment allows the chief operating decision maker to determine whether the operating segment’s results are providing the desired rate of return after covering our cost of capital we record charges on contract land deposits when we determine that it is probable that recovery of the deposit is impaired for segment reporting purposes impairments on contract land deposits are generally charged to the operating segment upon the determination to terminate a finished lot purchase agreement with the developer or to restructure a lot purchase agreement resulting in the forfeiture of the deposit we evaluate our entire net contract land deposit portfolio for impairment each quarter for additional information regarding our contract land deposit impairment analysis see the “critical accounting policies” section within this “management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for presentation purposes below the contract land deposit reserve at december 31 2015 and 2014 has been allocated to the reportable segments for the respective years to show contract land deposits on a net basis the net contract land deposit balances below also include approximately 3000 and 4700 at december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively of letters of credit issued as

segment new orders and the average sales price for new orders in 2014 increased 5 and 4 respectively compared to 2013 new orders were favorably impacted by an 11 increase in the average number of active communities in 2014 compared to 2013 offset partially by lower absorption rates attributable to lower traffic levels year over year the increase in the average sales price of new orders was attributable to the favorable market conditions in 2013 which led to higher average sales prices entering 2014

the south east segment had an approximate 2500 or 7 increase in segment profit in 2014 compared to 2013 segment revenues increased approximately 34400 or 8 year over year due to a 2 increase in the number of units settled and a 6 increase in the average settlement price the average settlement price in 2014 was favorably impacted by a 9 higher average price of homes in backlog entering 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 the south east segment’s gross profit margin increased to 183 in 2014 from 170 in 2013 due primarily to our average settlement prices increasing at a higher rate than lot and certain material costs year over year

segment new orders and the average sales price for new orders increased 6 and 5 respectively in 2014 compared to 2013 new orders were favorably impacted by an 8 increase in the number of active communities in 2014 compared to 2013 offset partially by lower absorption levels attributable to lower traffic levels year over year the increase in the average sales price for new orders in 2014 was attributable to the introduction of our nvhomes product line in the raleigh market in 2014 which sells at a higher price point and to a shift in mix in new orders to higher priced markets

homebuilding segment reconciliations to consolidated homebuilding operations 

in addition to the corporate capital allocation and contract land deposit impairments discussed above the other reconciling items between homebuilding segment profit and homebuilding consolidated profit before tax include unallocated corporate overhead which includes all management incentive compensation equitybased compensation expense consolidation adjustments and external corporate interest expense our overhead functions such as accounting treasury and human resources are centrally performed and the costs are not allocated to our operating segments consolidation adjustments consist of such items to convert the reportable segments’ results which are predominantly maintained on a cash basis to a full accrual basis for external financial statement presentation purposes and are not allocated to our operating segments external corporate interest expense is primarily comprised of interest charges on our 395 senior notes due 2022 the “senior notes” and is not charged to the operating segments because the charges are included in the corporate capital allocation discussed above 

 



 



 

  







 



mortgage banking segment

we conduct our mortgage banking activity through nvrm a wholly owned subsidiary nvrm focuses almost exclusively on serving the homebuilding segment customer base the following table summarizes the results of our mortgage banking operations and certain statistical data for each of the last three years

 



2015 versus 2014 

loan closing volume in 2015 increased by approximately 658700 or 23 from 2014 the increase was primarily attributable to a 20 increase in the number of loans closed and a 3 increase in the average loan amount year over year the increase in the number of loans closed was primarily attributable to the aforementioned increase in the homebuilding segment’s number of settlements in 2015 as compared to 2014 and an increase in the number of loans closed by nvrm for our homebuyers who obtain a mortgage to purchase the home the “capture rate” the capture rate increased from 84 in 2014 to 88 in 2015 the increase in the average loan amount is consistent with the homebuilding segment’s increase in average settlement price

 

segment profit in 2015 increased by approximately 20800 or 69 from 2014 the increase in segment profit was primarily attributable to an increase in mortgage banking fees partially offset by an increase in general and administrative expenses mortg age banking fees increased by approximately 24300 resulting from the aforementioned increase in loan closing volume and higher rate lock commitments general and administrative expenses increased by approximately 5200 resulting primarily from an incr ease in management incentive compensation attributable to the improved operating results in the current year 

2014 versus 2013

loan closing volume in 2014 increased 12 from 2013 the increase was primarily attributable to a 6 increase in the number of units closed and a 5 increase in the average loan amount year over year the increase in the number of units closed is attributable to an increase in the capture rate from 81 in 2013 to 84 in 2014 the increase in the average loan amount is primarily attributable to the increase in the homebuilding segment’s average settlement prices in 2014 as compared to 2013

segment profit in 2014 decreased approximately 11700 from 2013 the decrease in segment profit was primarily attributable to an approximate 7300 decrease in mortgage banking fees and an approximate 4400 increase in general and administrative expenses the decrease in mortgage banking fees was primarily attributable to a decrease in secondary marketing fees due to a product mix shift out of fixed rate government product due to increased consumer costs on fha mortgage loans and an increase in adjustable rate loans which generally are less profitable than fixed rate products the relative product mix shift from fixed rate to adjustable rate products is attributable to interest rate volatility in 2014 the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to an increase in compensation costs as a result of a 12 increase in average headcount in 2014 compared to 2013

mortgage banking – other

we sell all of the loans we originate into the secondary mortgage market insofar as we underwrite our originated loans to the standards and specifications of the ultimate investor we have no further financial obligations from the issuance of loans except in certain limited instances where early payment default occurs those underwriting standards are typically equal to or more stringent than the underwriting standards required by fnma va and fha because we sell all of our loans and do not service them there is often a substantial delay between the time that a loan goes into default and the time that the investor requests us to reimburse them for losses incurred because of the default we believe that all of the loans that we originate are underwritten to the standards and specifications of the ultimate investor to whom we sell our originated loans we employ a quality control department to ensure that our underwriting controls are effective and further assess the underwriting function as part of our assessment of internal controls over financial reporting

we maintain an allowance for losses on mortgage loans originated that reflects our judgment of the present loss exposure from the loans that we have originated and sold the allowance is calculated based on an analysis of historical experience and exposure at december 31 2015 we had an allowance for loan losses of approximately 12300 although we consider the allowance for loan losses reflected on the december 31 2015 balance sheet to be adequate there can be no assurance that this allowance will prove to be adequate to cover losses on loans previously originated

nvrm is dependent on our homebuilding operation’s customers for business if new orders and selling prices of the homebuilding segment decline nvrm’s operations will also be adversely affected in addition nvrm’s operating results may be adversely affected in future periods due to tightening and volatility of the credit markets changes in investor funding times increased regulation of mortgage lending practices and increased competition in the mortgage market

seasonality

we generally have higher new order activity in the first half of the year and higher home settlements revenues and net income in the second half of the year 

effective tax rate

our consolidated effective tax rate in 2015 2014 and 2013 was 3652 3790 and 3636 respectively during 2014 we recognized income tax expense of approximately 7000 due to the reversal of certain previously recognized tax deductions

liquidity and capital resources 

lines of credit and notes payable 

our homebuilding business segment funds its operations from cash flows provided by operating activities and the public debt and equity markets on september 10 2012 we completed an offering for 600000 aggregate principal amount of 395 senior notes due 2022 under a shelf registration statement filed on september 5 2012 with the sec the senior notes were issued at a discount to yield 397 and have been reflected net of the unamortized discount in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet the senior notes mature on september 15 2022 and bear interest at 395 payable semiannually in arrears on march 15 and september 15 the senior notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with any of our existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness will rank senior in right of payment to any of our future indebtedness that is by its terms expressly subordinated to the senior notes and will be effectively subordinated to any of our existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness the indenture governing the senior notes does not contain any financial covenants however it does contain among other items and subject to certain exceptions covenants that restrict our ability to create incur assume or guarantee secured debt enter into sale and leaseback transactions and conditions related to mergers andor the sale of assets

our mortgage subsidiary nvrm provides for its mortgage origination and other operating activities using cash generated from operations borrowings from its parent company nvr as well as a revolving mortgage repurchase facility which is nonrecourse to nvr on january 18 2016 nvrm entered into the seventh amendment the “amendment” to its amended and restated master repurchase agreement dated august 2 2011 with us bank national association as amended by the amendment and six earlier amendments the “repurchase agreement” the repurchase agreement provides borrowing capacity up to 150000 as compared to 25000 prior to the amendment subject to certain sublimits and provides for an incremental commitment pursuant to which we may from time to time request increases in the total commitment available under the repurchase agreement by up to 50000 in the aggregate the purpose of the repurchase agreement is to finance the origination of mortgage loans by nvrm the repurchase 

 

agreement expires on july 27 2016 advances under the repurchase agreement carry a pricing rate based on the libor rate plus the libor margin  as determined under the repurchase agreement provided that the pricing rate shall not be less than 225 there are several restrictions on purchas ed loans including that they cannot be sold to others they cannot be pledged to anyone other than the agent and they cannot support any other borrowing or repurchase agreement the repurchase agreement contains various affirmative and negative covenants  the negative covenants include among others certain limitations on transactions involving acquisitions mergers the incurrence of debt sale of assets and creation of liens upon any of its mortgage notes additional covenants include i a tangible net worth requirement ii a minimum liquidity requirement iii a minimum net income requirement and iv a maximum leverage ratio requirement we were in compliance with all covenants under the repurchase agreement at december 31 2015 at december 31 2 015 there was no debt outstanding under the repurchase agreement and there were no borrowing base limitations 

equity repurchases 

in addition to funding growth in our homebuilding and mortgage banking operations we historically have used a substantial portion of our excess liquidity to repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock in open market and privately negotiated transactions this ongoing repurchase activity is conducted pursuant to publicly announced board authorizations and is typically executed in accordance with the safeharbor provisions of rule 10b18 promulgated under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended in addition the board resolutions authorizing us to repurchase shares of our common stock specifically prohibit us from purchasing shares from our officers directors profit sharing plan trust or employee stock ownership plan trust the repurchase program assists us in accomplishing our primary objective creating increases in shareholder value see “market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities” in item 5 of this form 10k for disclosure of amounts repurchased during the fourth quarter of 2015 for the year ended december 31 2015 we repurchased 289687 shares of our common stock at an aggregate purchase price of 431367 as of december 31 2015 we had approximately 339200 available under board approved repurchase authorizations 

cash flows

for the year ended december 31 2015 cash and cash equivalents decreased by 120103 net cash provided by operating activities was 203391 cash provided by earnings in 2015 was used to fund the increase in homebuilding inventory of 134803 as a result of an increase in units under construction at december 31 2015 compared to december 31 2014 and the increase of 37561in contract land deposits cash was favorably impacted by an increase of 55404 in accounts payable and accrued expenses associated with the increase in homebuilding inventory net cash used in investing activities in 2015 of 1022 included cash used for purchases of property plant and equipment of 18277 and investments in our unconsolidated jvs totaling 1917 these were partially offset by the receipt of capital distributions from our unconsolidated jvs totaling 18489 net cash used in financing activities was 322472 due primarily to our repurchase of 289687 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of 431367 under our ongoing common stock repurchase program as discussed above stock option exercise activity during 2015 provided 85948 in proceeds and we realized 23311 in excess income tax benefits from equitybased compensation plan activity

for the year ended december 31 2014 cash and cash equivalents decreased by 320834 net cash provided by operating activities was 184549 cash was provided by homebuilding operations and net proceeds of 55830 from mortgage loan activity cash was used to fund the increase in homebuilding inventory of 127729 as a result of an increase in the number of units under construction at december 31 2014 compared to december 31 2013 cash was also used to fund the 57566 increase in contract land deposits year over year investing activities in 2014 used net cash of 19082 due primarily to the addition of 31672 in property plant and equipment offset partially by the receipt of 11569 of capital distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures net cash used in financing activities was 486301 due primarily to our repurchase of 507648 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of 567544 this use of cash in financing activities was partially offset by 76153 in proceeds from stock option exercises

for the year ended december 31 2013 cash and cash equivalents decreased by 287254 net cash provided by operating activities was 270222 cash was provided by homebuilding operations and by an increase of 114456 in accounts payable accrued expenses and customer deposits in 2013 compared to 2012 accounts payables were higher due primarily to an increase in our inventory levels while accrued expenses were higher due to increased warranty reserves and income taxes payable attributable to our increased earnings cash was used to fund the increase to homebuilding inventory of 52861 due to increased units under construction at the end of 2013 compared to 2012 in addition cash was used to fund the 40034 increase in contract land deposits year over year investing activities during 2013 used net cash of 34477 primarily as a result of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures totaling 22850 cash was also used for the purchase of property plant and equipment totaling 19016 during 2013 these uses of cash from investing activities were partially offset by capital distributions of 6782 received from our unconsolidated joint ventures net cash used in financing activities was 522999 due primarily to our purchase of treasury stock during 2013 we repurchased 581387 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of 554491 this use of cash in financing activities was partially offset by 13957 in proceeds from stock option exercises and the realization of 20636 in excess income tax benefits from equitybased compensation plan activity and deferred compensation plan distributions 

 

at december 31 2015 and 2014 the homebuilding segment had restricted cash of 23440 and 24106 respectively which is included in “other assets” on the accompanying consolidated balance sh eets the restricted cash balances relate primarily to holding requirements for outstanding letters of credit issued under our letter of credit agreement and customer deposits for certain home sales 

we believe that our current cash holdings cash generated from operations and the public debt and equity markets will be sufficient to satisfy near and long term cash requirements for working capital and debt service in both our homebuilding and mortgage banking operations

offbalance sheet arrangements 

lot acquisition strategy

we generally do not engage in land development instead we typically acquire finished building lots at market prices from various land developers under fixed price purchase agreements that require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the agreement the deposits required under the purchase agreements are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percentage typically ranging up to 10 of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots 

we believe that our lot acquisition strategy reduces the financial requirements and risks associated with direct land ownership and land development we may at our option choose for any reason and at any time not to perform under these purchase agreements by delivering notice of our intent not to acquire the finished lots under contract our sole legal obligation and economic loss for failure to perform under these purchase agreements is limited to the amount of the deposit pursuant to the liquidated damage provision contained in the purchase agreements we do not have any financial guarantees or completion obligations and we typically do not guarantee lot purchases on a specific performance basis under these purchase agreements

at december 31 2015 we controlled approximately 74500 lots through lot purchase agreements joint ventures and land under development with an aggregate purchase price of approximately 6900000 these lots are controlled by making or committing to make deposits of approximately 472600 in the form of cash and letters of credit our entire risk of loss pertaining to the aggregate purchase price contractual commitment resulting from our nonperformance under the contracts is limited to our 378400 in deposits paid plus approximately 94200 related to deposits to be paid subsequent to december 31 2015 assuming that contractual development milestones are met by the developers and we exercise our option and approximately 1500 in specific performance obligations see contractual obligations section below of the 378400 deposit total approximately 373300 was in cash and approximately 5100 was in letters of credit which had been issued as of december 31 2015 as of december 31 2015 we had recorded an impairment valuation allowance of approximately 42200 related to certain cash deposits currently outstanding additionally as of december 31 2015 we had funding commitments totaling 11500 to three of our joint ventures and approximately 19200 under a joint development agreement related to our land under development a portion of which we expect will be offset by development credits of approximately 9600 

in addition  we have certain properties under contract with land owners that are expected to yield approximately 8800 lots which are not included in our number of total lots controlled above some of these properties may require rezoning or other approvals to achieve the expected yield these properties are controlled with cash deposits and letters of credit totaling approximately 12200 and 350 respectively as of december 31 2015 of which approximately 8700 is refundable if we do not perform under the contract and the remainder is at risk of loss we generally expect to assign the raw land contracts to a land developer and simultaneously enter into a lot purchase agreement with the assignee if the project is determined to be feasible in february 2016 we acquired one of these properties at a cost of approximately 150000 which is expected to produce approximately 1000 lots  of which approximately 160 lots are under contract with unrelated parties of the total 12200 in cash deposits noted above 5000 relates to this property please refer to note 1 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of the contract land deposits and note 3 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of our lot acquisition strategy in relation to our accounting for variable interest entities

bonds and letters of credit

we enter into bond or letter of credit arrangements with local municipalities government agencies or land developers to collateralize our obligations under various contracts we had approximately 58300 of contingent obligations under such agreements as of december 31 2015 inclusive of the 5500 of lot acquisition deposits in the form of letters of credit discussed above we believe we will fulfill our obligations under the related contracts and do not anticipate any material losses under these bonds or letters of credit 

mortgage commitments and forward sales

in the normal course of business nvrm enters into contractual commitments to extend credit to buyers of singlefamily homes with fixed expiration dates the commitments become effective when the borrowers “lockin” a specified interest rate within time frames established by us all mortgagors are evaluated for credit worthiness prior to the extension of the commitment market risk arises if interest rates move adversely between the time of the “lockin” of rates by the borrower and the sale date of the loan to a 

 

brokerdealer to mitigate the effect of the interest rate risk inherent in providing rate lock commitments to borrowers we enter into optional or mandatory delivery forward sale contracts to sell whole loans and mortgagebacked securities to brokerdealers the forward sale contracts lock in an interest rate and price for the sale of loans similar to the specific rate lock commitments we do not engage in speculative or trading derivative activities both the rate lock commitments to borrowers and the forward sale contracts to brokerdealers are undesignated derivatives and accordingly are marked to fair value through earnings at december 31 2015 we had contractual commitments to exte nd credit to borrowers aggregating 462329 and open forward delivery contracts aggregating 737052 which hedge both the rate lock loan commitments and closed loans held for sale see note 14 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a de scription of our fair value accounting 

contractual obligations

our fixed noncancelable obligations as of december 31 2015 were as follows 

 



 









critical accounting policies

general

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods we continually evaluate the estimates we use to prepare the consolidated financial statements and update those estimates as necessary in general our estimates are based on historical experience on information from third party professionals and other various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances actual results could differ materially from those estimates made by management

homebuilding inventory 

the carrying value of inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market value cost of lots and completed and uncompleted housing units represent the accumulated actual cost of the units field construction supervisors’ salaries and related direct overhead expenses are included in inventory costs interest costs are not capitalized into inventory with the exception of land under development upon settlement the cost of the unit is expensed on a specific identification basis cost of building materials is determined on a firstin firstout basis

sold inventory is evaluated for impairment based on the contractual selling price compared to the total estimated cost to construct plus a reasonable profit margin unsold inventory is evaluated for impairment by analyzing recent comparable sale prices within the applicable community compared to the costs incurred to date plus the expected costs to complete and a reasonable profit margin any calculated impairments are recorded immediately 

 

land under develop ment and contract land deposits 

land under development 

on a limited basis we directly acquire raw parcels of land already zoned for its intended use to develop into finished lots land under development includes the land acquisition costs direct improvement costs capitalized interest where applicable and real estate taxes

land under development including the land under development held by our unconsolidated joint ventures and the related joint venture investments is reviewed for potential writedowns when impairment indicators are present in addition to considering market and economic conditions we assess land under development impairments on a communitybycommunity basis analyzing as applicable current sales absorption levels recent sales’ gross profit and the dollar differential between the projected fullydeveloped cost of the lots and the current market price for lots if indicators of impairment are present for a community we perform an analysis to determine if the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts and if they are impairment charges are required to be recorded in an amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets our determination of fair value is primarily based on discounting the estimated future cash flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams

at december 31 2015 we had approximately 60600 in land under development in four separate communities in addition at december 31 2015 we had an aggregate investment totaling approximately 60500 in six separate joint ventures that controlled land under development none of the communities classified as land under development nor any of the undeveloped land held by the joint ventures had any indicators of impairment at december 31 2015 as such we do not believe that any of the land under development is impaired at this time however there can be no assurance that we will not incur impairment charges in the future due to unanticipated adverse changes in the economy or other events adversely affecting specific markets or the homebuilding industry 

contract land deposits 

we purchase finished lots under fixed price purchase agreements that require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the contract the deposits are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percentage of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots

we maintain an allowance for losses on contract land deposits that reflects our judgment of the present loss exposure in the existing contract land deposit portfolio at the end of the reporting period to analyze contract land deposit impairments we utilize a loss contingency analysis that is conducted each quarter in addition to considering market and economic conditions we assess contract land deposit impairments on a communitybycommunity basis pursuant to the purchase contract terms analyzing as applicable current sales absorption levels recent sales’ gross profit the dollar differential between the contractual purchase price and the current market price for lots a developer’s financial stability a developer’s financial ability or willingness to reduce lot prices to current market prices and the contract’s default status by either us or the developer along with an analysis of the expected outcome of any such default 

our analysis is focused on whether we can sell houses profitably in a particular community in the current market with which we are faced because we do not own the finished lots on which we had placed a contract land deposit if the above analysis leads to a determination that we cannot sell homes profitably at the current contractual lot price we then determine whether we will elect to default under the contract forfeit our deposit and terminate the contract or whether we will attempt to restructure the lot purchase contract which may require us to forfeit the deposit to obtain contract concessions from a developer we also assess whether an impairment is present due to collectability issues resulting from a developer’s nonperformance because of financial or other conditions 

although we consider the allowance for losses on contract land deposits reflected on the december 31 2015 consolidated balance sheet to be adequate see note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included herein there can be no assurance that this allowance will prove to be adequate over time to cover losses due to unanticipated adverse changes in the economy or other events adversely affecting specific markets or the homebuilding industry 

warrantyproduct liability accruals

warranty and product liability accruals are established to provide for estimated future costs as a result of construction and product defects product recalls and litigation incidental to our business liability estimates are determined based on our judgment considering such factors as historical experience the likely current cost of corrective action manufacturers’ and subcontractors’ participation in sharing the cost of corrective action consultations with third party experts such as engineers and evaluations by our general counsel and outside counsel retained to handle specific product liability cases although we consider the warranty and product liability accrual reflected on the december 31 2015 consolidated balance sheet to be adequate see note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included herein there can be no assurance that this accrual will prove to be adequate over time to cover losses due to increased costs for material and labor the inability or refusal of manufacturers or subcontractors to 

 

financially participate in corrective action unanticipated adverse legal settlements or other unanticipated changes to the assumptions used to estimate the warranty and product liability accrual 

equitybased compensation expense 

compensation costs related to our equitybased compensation plans are recognized within our income statement the costs recognized are based on the grantdate fair value compensation cost for equitybased grants is recognized on a straightline basis over the requisite service period for the entire award from the date of grant through the period of the last separately vesting portion of the grant for the recognition of equitybased compensation expense the options which are subject to a performance condition are treated as a separate award from the “serviceonly” options and compensation expense is recognized when it becomes probable that the stated performance target will be achieved

we calculate the fair value of our nonpublicly traded employee options using the blackscholes optionpricing model while the blackscholes model is a widely accepted method to calculate the fair value of options its results are dependent on input variables two of which expected term and expected volatility are significantly dependent on management’s judgment we have concluded that our historical exercise experience is the best estimate of future exercise patterns to determine an option’s expected term to estimate expected volatility we analyze the historical volatility of our common stock over a period equal to the option’s expected term changes in management’s judgment of the expected term and the expected volatility could have a material effect on the grantdate fair value calculated and expensed within the income statement in addition we are required to estimate future grant forfeitures when considering the amount of stockbased compensation costs to record we have concluded that our historical forfeiture rate is the best measure to base our estimate of future forfeitures of equitybased compensation grants however there can be no assurance that our future forfeiture rate will not be materially higher or lower than our historical forfeiture rate which would affect the aggregate cumulative compensation expense recognized 

in addition when recognizing stock based compensation cost related to “performance condition” option grants we are required to make a determination as to whether the performance conditions will be met prior to the completion of the actual performance period the performance metric is based on our return on capital performance during a specified three year period based on the date of option grant with the initial performance period being 2014 through 2016 while we currently believe that this performance condition will be satisfied at the target level and are recognizing compensation expense related to such options accordingly our future expected activity levels could cause us to make a different determination resulting in a change to the compensation expense to be recognized related to performance condition option grants that would otherwise have been recognized to date although we believe that the compensation costs recognized in 2015 are representative of the cumulative ratable amortization of the grantdate fair value of unvested options outstanding and expected to be exercised changes to the estimated input values such as expected term and expected volatility and changes to the determination of whether performance condition grants will vest could produce widely different fair values

mortgage loan loss allowance 

we originate several different loan products to our customers to finance the purchase of their home we sell all of the loans we originate into the secondary mortgage market generally within 30 days from origination all of the loans that we originate are underwritten to the standards and specifications of the ultimate investor insofar as we underwrite our originated loans to those standards we bear no increased concentration of credit risk from the issuance of loans except in certain limited instances where early payment default occurs those underwriting standards are typically equal to or more stringent than the underwriting standards required by fnma va and fha we employ a quality control department to ensure that our underwriting controls are effectively operating and further assess the underwriting function as part of our assessment of internal controls over financial reporting we maintain an allowance for losses on mortgage loans originated that reflects our judgment of the present loss exposure in the loans that we have originated and sold the allowance is calculated based on an analysis of historical experience and exposure although we consider the allowance for loan losses reflected on the december 31 2015 consolidated balance sheet to be adequate see note 15 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included herein there can be no assurance that this allowance will prove to be adequate over time to cover losses due to unanticipated changes to the assumptions used to estimate the mortgage loan loss allowance

market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates our market risk arises from interest rate risk inherent in our financial instruments and debt obligations interest rate risk results from the possibility that changes in interest rates will cause unfavorable changes in net income or in the value of interest ratesensitive assets liabilities and commitments lower interest rates tend to increase demand for mortgage loans for home purchasers while higher interest rates make it more difficult for potential borrowers to purchase residential properties and to qualify for mortgage loans we have no market rate sensitive instruments held for speculative or trading purposes 

our homebuilding segment is exposed to interest rate risk as it relates to its debt obligations in september 2012 we issued 600000 of senior notes the senior notes mature on september 15 2022 and bear interest at 395 payable semiannually in arrears on march 15 and september 15 changes to interest rates generally affect the fair value of fixedrate debt instruments but not earnings or cash flows we generally have no obligation to prepay the senior notes prior to maturity and therefore interest rate fluctuations should not have a significant impact on our fixedrate debt 

our mortgage banking segment is exposed to interest rate risk as it relates to its lending activities the mortgage banking segment originates mortgage loans which are sold through either optional or mandatory forward delivery contracts into the secondary markets all of the mortgage banking segment’s loan portfolio is held for sale and subject to forward sale commitments nvrm also sells all of its mortgages held for sale on a servicing released basis 

nvrm has available a mortgage repurchase agreement which as of december 31 2015 provided for loan repurchases up to 25000 subject to certain sub limits the repurchase agreement is used to fund nvrm’s mortgage origination activities advances under the repurchase agreement carry a pricing rate based on the libor rate plus the libor margin as determined under the repurchase agreement provided that the pricing rate shall not be less than 270 on january 18 2016 the repurchase agreement was amended “amended repurchase agreement” to increase the borrowing capacity to 150000 with an incremental commitment pursuant to which nvrm may from time to time request increases in the total commitment available under the agreement by up to 50000 in the aggregate other terms of the amended repurchase agreement are materially consistent with the repurchase agreement at december 31 2015 there was no debt outstanding under the repurchase agreement

the following table represents the contractual balances of our onbalance sheet financial instruments at the expected maturity dates as well as the fair values of those onbalance sheet financial instruments at december 31 2015 the expected maturity categories take into consideration the actual and anticipated amortization of principal and do not take into consideration the reinvestment of cash or the refinancing of existing indebtedness because we sell all of the mortgage loans we originate into the secondary markets we have made the assumption that the portfolio of mortgage loans held for sale will mature in the first year consequently advances outstanding under the repurchase agreement would also be assumed to mature in the first year

business

general 

nvr inc a virginia corporation was formed in 1980 as nvhomes inc our primary business is the construction and sale of singlefamily detached homes townhomes and condominium buildings all of which are primarily constructed on a presold basis to more fully serve customers of our homebuilding operations we also operate a mortgage banking and title services business we conduct our homebuilding activities directly our mortgage banking operations are operated primarily through a wholly owned subsidiary nvr mortgage finance inc “nvrm” unless the context otherwise requires references to “nvr” “we” “us” or “our” include nvr inc and its consolidated subsidiaries 

we are one of the largest homebuilders in the united states we operate in multiple locations in fourteen states and washington dc primarily in the eastern part of the united states during 2014 approximately 26 and 11 of our home settlements occurred in the washington dc and baltimore md metropolitan areas respectively which accounted for approximately 33 and 13 respectively of our 2014 homebuilding revenues our homebuilding operations include the construction and sale of singlefamily detached homes townhomes and condominium buildings under four trade names ryan homes nvhomes fox ridge homes and heartland homes the ryan homes and fox ridge homes products are marketed primarily to firsttime and firsttime moveup buyers ryan homes operates in twentyseven metropolitan areas located in maryland virginia washington dc west virginia pennsylvania new york north carolina south carolina florida ohio new jersey delaware indiana illinois and tennessee fox ridge homes operates in the nashville tn metropolitan area the nvhomes and heartland homes products are marketed primarily to moveup and upscale buyers nvhomes operates in delaware and the washington dc baltimore md philadelphia pa and raleigh nc metropolitan areas heartland homes operates in the pittsburgh pa metropolitan area in 2014 our average price of a settled unit was approximately 368500 

historically we generally have not engaged in land development see discussion below on our limited land development activities instead we typically acquire finished building lots at market prices from various development entities under fixed price purchase agreements “purchase agreements” that require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the purchase agreements the deposits required under the purchase agreements are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percentage typically ranging up to 10 of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots 

we believe that our lot acquisition strategy avoids the financial requirements and risks associated with direct land ownership and land development we may at our option choose for any reason and at any time not to perform under these purchase agreements by delivering notice of our intent not to acquire the finished lots under contract our sole legal obligation and economic loss for failure to perform under these purchase agreements is limited to the amount of the deposit pursuant to the liquidated damage provision contained within the purchase agreements we do not have any financial guarantees or completion obligations and we typically do not guarantee lot purchases on a specific performance basis under these purchase agreements none of the creditors of any of the development entities with which we have entered these purchase agreements have recourse to our general credit we generally seek to maintain control over a supply of lots believed to be suitable to meet our fiveyear business plan 

in addition to constructing homes primarily on a presold basis and utilizing what we believe is a conservative lot acquisition strategy we focus on obtaining and maintaining a leading market position in each market we serve this strategy allows us to gain valuable efficiencies and competitive advantages in our markets which we believe contributes to minimizing the adverse effects of regional economic cycles and provides growth opportunities within these markets our continued success is contingent upon our ability to control an adequate supply of finished lots on which to build as a result in certain specific strategic circumstances we deviate from our historical lot acquisition strategy and engage in joint venture arrangements with land developers or directly acquire raw ground already zoned for its intended use for development once we acquire control of any raw ground we determine whether to sell the raw parcel to a developer and enter into a purchase agreement with the developer to purchase the finished lots or whether to hire a developer to develop the land on our behalf while joint venture arrangements and direct land development activity are not our preferred method of acquiring finished building lots we may enter into additional transactions in the future on a limited basis where there exists a compelling strategic or prudent financial reason to do so we expect however to continue to acquire substantially all of our finished lot inventory using purchase agreements with forfeitable deposits 

as of december 31 2014 we controlled approximately 62800 lots under purchase agreements with deposits in cash and letters of credit totaling approximately 3484 million and 17 million respectively included in the number of controlled lots are approximately 7800 lots for which we have recorded a contract land deposit impairment reserve of approximately 561 million as of december 31 2014 in addition we had an aggregate investment totaling approximately 820 million in five separate joint venture limited liability corporations “jvs” expected to produce approximately 8800 lots of the lots controlled by the jvs approximately 3300 were not under contract with us at december 31 2014 further as of december 31 2014 we directly owned four separate raw parcels of land zoned for their intended use with a current cost basis including development costs of approximately 337 million 

 

that we intend to develop into approximately 480 finished lots for use in our homebuilding operations of the total finished lots expected to be developed 94 lots are under contract to be sold to an unrelated party under lot purchase agreements see notes 3 4 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information regarding fixed price purchase agreements jvs and land under development respectively a dditionally we have certain properties under contract with land owners that are expected to yield approximately 5700 lots which are not included in our number of total lots controlled some of these properties may require rezoning or other approvals to achieve the expected yield these properties are controlled with deposits and letters of credit totaling approximately 23 million and 30 million respectively as of december 31 2014 of which approximately 26 million is refundable if we do not perform under the contract we generally expect to assign the raw land contracts to a land developer and simultaneously enter into a lot purchase agreement with the assignee if the project is determined to be feasible 

in addition to building and selling homes we provide a number of mortgagerelated services through our mortgage banking operations through operations in each of our homebuilding markets nvrm originates mortgage loans almost exclusively for our homebuyers nvrm generates revenues primarily from origination fees gains on sales of loans and title fees nvrm sells all of the mortgage loans it closes into the secondary markets on a servicing released basis 

segment information for our homebuilding and mortgage banking businesses is included in note 2 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

current business environment 

the housing market recovery continues to be uneven during 2014 the housing market experienced some weakness as existing home inventory increased and affordability decreased following increasing prices during 2013 there has also been an increase in the number of new home communities in many markets these factors have resulted in weakness in housing prices in 2014 in addition the housing market continues to face challenges from tightened mortgage underwriting standards we believe that a continuation of the housing market recovery which began in 2012 is dependent upon a sustained overall economic recovery driven by continued improvement in job growth and consumer confidence levels as well as improvement in wage growth and household formation for additional information and analysis of recent trends in our operations and financial condition see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 of this form 10k 

homebuilding 

products 

we offer singlefamily detached homes townhomes and condominium buildings with many different basic home designs these home designs have a variety of elevations and numerous other options our homes combine traditional transitional cottage or urban exterior designs with contemporary interior designs and amenities generally include two to four bedrooms and range from approximately 800 to 7300 square feet during 2014 the prices at which we settled homes ranged from approximately 120000 to 15 million and averaged approximately 368500 during 2013 our average price was approximately 349100 

markets 

our four reportable homebuilding segments operate in the following geographic regions 

 



backlog 

backlog totaled 5475 units and approximately 21 billion at december 31 2014 compared to backlog of 4945 units and approximately 18 billion at december 31 2013 backlog which represents homes sold but not yet settled with the customer may be impacted by customer cancellations for various reasons that are beyond our control such as the customer’s failure to obtain mortgage financing inability to sell an existing home job loss or a variety of other reasons in any period a portion of the cancellations that we experience are related to new sales that occurred during the same period and a portion are related to sales that occurred in prior periods and therefore appeared in the opening backlog for the current period expressed as the total of all cancellations during the period as a percentage of gross sales during the period our cancellation rate was approximately 15 in each of 2014 2013 and 2012 additionally during each of 2014 2013 and 2012 approximately 6 of a reporting quarter’s opening backlog balance cancelled during the fiscal quarter we can provide no assurance that our historical cancellation rates are indicative of the actual cancellation 

 

rate that may occur in future periods other than those units that are cancelled we expect to settle substantially all of our december 31 2014 backlog during 2015 see “risk factors” in item 1a and “seasonality” in item 7 of this form 10k 

further discussion of settlements new orders and backlog activity by our homebuilding reportable segment for each of the last three years can be found in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 of this form 10k 

construction 

we utilize independent subcontractors under fixed price contracts to perform construction work on our homes we use several independent subcontractors in our various markets and we are not dependent on any single subcontractor or on a small number of subcontractors 

sales and marketing 

our preferred marketing method is for customers to visit a furnished model home featuring many builtin options and a landscaped lot the garages of these model homes are usually converted into temporary sales centers where alternative facades and floor plans are displayed and designs for other models are available for review sales representatives are compensated predominantly on a commission basis 

regulation 

we and our subcontractors must comply with various federal state and local zoning building environmental advertising and consumer credit statutes rules and regulations as well as other regulations and requirements in connection with our construction and sales activities all of these regulations have increased the cost to produce and market our products and in some instances have delayed our developers’ ability to deliver finished lots to us counties and cities in which we build homes have at times declared moratoriums on the issuance of building permits and imposed other restrictions in the areas in which sewage treatment facilities and other public facilities do not reach minimum standards in addition our homebuilding operations are regulated in certain areas by restrictive zoning and density requirements that limit the number of homes that can be built within the boundaries of a particular area to date restrictive zoning laws and the imposition of moratoriums have not had a material adverse effect on our construction activities 

competition and market factors 

the housing industry is highly competitive we compete with numerous homebuilders of varying size ranging from local to national in scope some of which have greater financial resources than we do we also face competition from the home resale market our homebuilding operations compete primarily on the basis of price location design quality service and reputation historically we have been one of the market leaders in each of the markets where we build homes 

the housing industry is cyclical and is affected by consumer confidence levels prevailing economic conditions and interest rates other factors that affect the housing industry and the demand for new homes include the availability and the cost of land labor and materials changes in consumer preferences demographic trends and the availability of mortgage finance programs see “risk factors” in item 1a of this form 10k 

we are dependent upon building material suppliers for a continuous flow of raw materials whenever possible we utilize standard products available from multiple sources in the past such raw materials have been generally available to us in adequate supply 

mortgage banking 

we provide a number of mortgage related services to our homebuilding customers through our mortgage banking operations our mortgage banking operations also include separate subsidiaries that broker title insurance and perform title searches in connection with mortgage loan closings for which they receive commissions and fees because nvrm originates mortgage loans almost exclusively for our homebuilding customers nvrm is dependent on our homebuilding segment in 2014 nvrm closed approximately 9100 loans with an aggregate principal amount of approximately 28 billion as compared to approximately 8600 loans with an aggregate principal amount of approximately 25 billion in 2013 

nvrm sells all of the mortgage loans it closes to investors in the secondary markets on a servicing released basis typically within 30 days from the loan closing nvrm is an approved sellerservicer for fannie mae “fnma” mortgage loans and an approved sellerissuer of ginnie mae “gnma” freddie mac “fhlmc” department of veterans affairs “va” and federal housing administration “fha” mortgage loans 

 

regulation 

nvrm is an approved sellerservicer of fnma mortgage loans and an approved sellerissuer of gnma fhlmc va and fha mortgage loans and is subject to all of those agencies’ rules and regulations these rules and regulations restrict certain activities of nvrm nvrm is currently eligible and expects to remain eligible to participate in such programs in addition nvrm is subject to regulation at the state and federal level including regulations issued by the consumer financial protection bureau the “cfpb” with respect to specific origination selling and servicing practices 

competition and market factors 

nvrm’s main competition comes from national regional and local mortgage bankers mortgage brokers credit unions and banks in each of these markets nvrm competes primarily on the basis of customer service variety of products offered interest rates offered prices of ancillary services and relative financing availability and costs 

pipeline 

nvrm’s mortgage loans in process that had not closed at december 31 2014 and 2013 had an aggregate principal balance of approximately 14 billion and 11 billion respectively nvrm’s cancellation rate was approximately 31 35 and 36 in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively we can provide no assurance that our historical loan cancellation rates are indicative of the actual loan cancellation rate that may occur in future periods see “risk factors” in item 1a in this form 10k 

employees 

at december 31 2014 we employed 3942 fulltime persons none of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement and we have never experienced a work stoppage we believe that our employee relations are good

risk factors 

tableend

our business is affected by the risks generally incident to the residential construction business including but not limited to 











all of these risks are discussed in detail below 

the homebuilding industry experienced a significant downturn from 2006 through 2011 although housing industry conditions are improving a deterioration in industry conditions could adversely affect our business and our results of operations 

during 2006 through 2011 the homebuilding industry experienced a significant downturn as a result of low consumer confidence driven by an economic recession high unemployment levels affordability issues and uncertainty as to the stability of home prices as a result we experienced reduced demand for new homes since 2011 we have experienced strengthening within the homebuilding industry with increasing sales however the housing market continues to face challenges from a tight mortgage lending environment and consumer confidence issues if the improvements in the homebuilding industry do not continue or the industry suffers another downturn our sales may decrease which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

if the market value of our inventory or controlled lot position declines our profit could decrease and we may incur losses 

inventory risk can be substantial for homebuilders the market value of building lots and housing inventories can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing market conditions in addition inventory carrying costs can be significant and can result in losses in a poorly performing project or market we must in the ordinary course of our business continuously seek and make acquisitions of lots for expansion into new markets as well as for replacement and expansion within our current markets which is generally accomplished by us entering fixed price purchase agreements and paying forfeitable deposits under the purchase agreement to developers for the contractual right to acquire the lots in the event of adverse changes in economic or market conditions we may cease further building activities in communities or restructure existing purchase agreements resulting in forfeiture of some or all of any remaining land contract deposit paid to the developer either action may result in a loss which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

if the underwriting quality of our mortgage originations is found to be deficient our profit could decrease and we may incur losses 

we originate several different loan products to our customers to finance the purchase of their home we sell all of the loans we originate into the secondary mortgage market generally within 30 days from origination all of the loans that we originate are underwritten to the standards and specifications of the ultimate investor insofar as we underwrite our originated loans to those standards we bear no increased concentration of credit risk from the issuance of loans except in certain limited instances where early payment default occurs in the event that a substantial number of the loans that we have originated fall into default and the investors to whom we sold the loans determine that we did not underwrite the loans in accordance with their requirements we could be required to repurchase the loans from the investor or indemnify the investor for any losses incurred this may result in losses which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

we may be subject to claims on mortgage loans sold to third parties 

our mortgage banking operations may be responsible for losses associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to investors in the event of errors or omissions relating to certain representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements including representations as to underwriting standards the type of collateral the existence of primary mortgage insurance and the 

 

validity of certain borrower representations in connection with the loan the resolution of claims related to alleged breaches of these representations and warranties and repurchase claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition cash flows and results of operations and could exceed existing estimates and accruals because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating these matters there can be no assurance that any amounts reserved will be adequate or that any potential inadequacies will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

because almost all of our customers require mortgage financing the availability of suitable mortgage financing could impair the affordability of our homes lower demand for our products and limit our ability to fully deliver our backlog 

our business and earnings depend on the ability of our potential customers to obtain mortgages for the purchase of our homes in addition many of our potential customers must sell their existing homes in order to buy a home from us the tightening of credit standards and the availability of suitable mortgage financing could prevent customers from buying our homes and could prevent buyers of our customers’ homes from obtaining mortgages they need to complete that purchase either of which could result in our potential customers’ inability to buy a home from us if our potential customers or the buyers of our customers’ current homes are not able to obtain suitable financing the result could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

if our ability to sell mortgages to investors is impaired we may be required to fund these commitments ourselves or may not be able to originate loans at all 

our mortgage banking business sells all of the loans it originates into the secondary market usually within 30 days from the date of closing and has up to approximately 25 million available in a repurchase agreement to fund mortgage closings in the event that disruptions to the secondary markets tighten or eliminate the available liquidity within the secondary markets for mortgage loans or the underwriting requirements by our secondary market investors continue to become more stringent our ability to sell future mortgages could decline and we could be required among other things to fund our commitments to our buyers with our own financial resources which is limited or require our home buyers to find another source of financing the result of such secondary market disruption could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

interest rate movements inflation and other economic factors can negatively impact our business 

high rates of inflation generally affect the homebuilding industry adversely because of their adverse impact on interest rates high interest rates not only increase the cost of borrowed funds to homebuilders but also have a significant adverse effect on housing demand and on the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective purchasers we are also subject to potential volatility in the price of commodities that impact costs of materials used in our homebuilding business increases in prevailing interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

our financial results also are affected by the risks generally incident to our mortgage banking business including interest rate levels the impact of government regulation on mortgage loan originations and servicing and the need to issue forward commitments to fund and sell mortgage loans our homebuilding customers account for almost all of our mortgage banking business the volume of our continuing homebuilding operations therefore affects our mortgage banking business 

our mortgage banking business also is affected by interest rate fluctuations we also may experience marketing losses resulting from daily increases in interest rates to the extent we are unable to match interest rates and amounts on loans we have committed to originate with forward commitments from third parties to purchase such loans increases in interest rates may have a material adverse effect on our mortgage banking revenue profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

our operations may also be adversely affected by other economic factors within our markets such as negative changes in employment levels job growth wage growth consumer confidence and household formation and availability of mortgage financing one or all of which could result in reduced demand or price depression from current levels such negative trends could have a material adverse effect on homebuilding operations 

these factors and thus the homebuilding business have at times in the past been cyclical in nature any downturn in the national economy or the local economies of the markets in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations in particular during 2014 approximately 26 and 11 of our home settlements occurred in the washington dc and baltimore md metropolitan areas respectively which accounted for approximately 33 and 13 respectively of our 2014 homebuilding revenues thus we are dependent to a significant extent on the economy and demand for housing in those areas 

 

our inability to secure and control an adequate inventory of lots could adversely impact our operations 

the results of our homebuilding operations are dependent upon our continuing ability to control an adequate number of homebuilding lots in desirable locations there can be no assurance that an adequate supply of building lots will continue to be available to us on terms similar to those available in the past or that we will not be required to devote a greater amount of capital to controlling building lots than we have historically an insufficient supply of building lots in one or more of our markets an inability of our developers to deliver finished lots in a timely fashion due to their inability to secure financing to fund development activities or for other reasons or our inability to purchase or finance building lots on reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

volatility in the credit and capital markets may impact our ability to access necessary financing 

if we require working capital greater than that provided by our operations we may be required to obtain alternative financing no assurance can be given that additional financing will be available on terms that are favorable or acceptable if we are required to seek financing to fund our working capital requirements volatility in those markets may restrict our flexibility to access financing if we are at any time unsuccessful in obtaining sufficient capital to fund our planned homebuilding expenditures we may experience a substantial delay in the completion of homes then under construction or we may be unable to control or purchase finished building lots any delay could result in cost increases and could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

our mortgage banking operations are dependent in part on the availability cost and other terms of mortgage financing facilities and may be adversely affected by any shortage or increased cost of such financing no assurance can be given that any additional or replacement financing will be available on terms that are favorable or acceptable our mortgage banking operations are also dependent upon the securitization market for mortgagebacked securities and could be materially adversely affected by any fluctuation or downturn in such market 

our current indebtedness may impact our future operations 

our existing indebtedness contains restrictive covenants and any future indebtedness may also contain such covenants these covenants include or could include restrictions on our ability to create incur assume or guarantee secured debt enter into sale and leaseback transactions and conditions related to mergers andor the sale of assets substantial losses by us or other action or inaction by us or our subsidiaries could result in the violation of one or more of these covenants which could result in decreased liquidity or a default on our current or future indebtedness thereby having a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

government regulations and environmental matters could negatively affect our operations 

we are subject to various local state and federal statutes ordinances rules and regulations concerning zoning building design construction and similar matters including local regulations that impose restrictive zoning and density requirements in order to limit the number of homes that can eventually be built within the boundaries of a particular area these regulations may further increase the cost to produce and market our products in addition we have from time to time been subject to and may also be subject in the future to periodic delays in our homebuilding projects due to building moratoriums in the areas in which we operate or delays in receiving the necessary governmental approvals changes in regulations that restrict homebuilding activities in one or more of our principal markets could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

in addition new housing developments are often subject to various assessments or impact fees for schools parks streets highways and other public improvements the cost of these assessments is subject to substantial change and can cause increases in the construction cost of our homes which in turn could reduce our profitability 

we are also subject to a variety of local state and federal statutes ordinances rules and regulations concerning the protection of health and the environment we are subject to a variety of environmental conditions that can affect our business and our homebuilding projects the particular environmental laws that apply to any given homebuilding site vary greatly according to the location and environmental condition of the site and the present and former uses of the site and adjoining properties environmental laws and conditions may result in delays cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs or prohibit or severely restrict homebuilding activity in certain environmentally sensitive regions or areas thereby adversely affecting our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

 

increased regulation of the mortgage industry could harm our future sales and earnings 

the mortgage industry remains under intense scrutiny and continues to face increasing regulation at the federal state and local level potential changes to federal laws and regulations could have the effect of limiting the activities of fnma and fhlmc the entities that provide liquidity to the secondary mortgage market which could lead to increases in mortgage interest rates in addition the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act enacted on july 21 2010 contains numerous provisions affecting residential mortgages and mortgage lending practices the cfpb issued rules governing multiple issues in january 2013 including “ability to repay” underwriting provisions definition and parameters of “qualified mortgages” and the establishment of certain protections from liability under “ability to repay” provisions for “qualified mortgages” the cfpb’s rulemaking also included limitations on certain fees and loan officer compensation requirements these rules were effective january 2014 in addition the new requirements integrating disclosures under the truth in lending act and the real estate settlement protection act become effective august 1 2015 the tighter underwriting requirements and fee restrictions and increasingly complex regulatory environment under these standards may negatively impact our mortgage loan origination business in the form of lower demand decreased revenue and increased operating costs 

we are an approved sellerservicer of fnma mortgage loans and an approved sellerissuer of gnma fhlmc va and fha mortgage loans and are subject to all of those agencies’ rules and regulations any significant impairment of our eligibility to sellservice these loans could have a material adverse impact on our mortgage operations in addition we are subject to regulation at the state and federal level with respect to specific origination selling and servicing practices including the real estate settlement and protection act adverse changes in governmental regulation may have a negative impact on our mortgage loan origination business

we face competition in our homebuilding and mortgage banking operations 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive we compete with numerous homebuilders of varying size ranging from local to national in scope some of whom have greater financial resources than we do we face competition 







our homebuilding operations compete primarily on the basis of price location design quality service and reputation 

the mortgage banking industry is also competitive our main competition comes from national regional and local mortgage bankers credit unions banks and mortgage brokers in each of these markets our mortgage banking operations compete primarily on the basis of customer service variety of products offered interest rates offered prices of ancillary services and relative financing availability and costs 

there can be no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully in our homebuilding or mortgage banking operations an inability to effectively compete may have an adverse impact on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

a shortage of building materials or labor or increases in materials or labor costs may adversely impact our operations 

the homebuilding business has from time to time experienced building material and labor shortages including shortages in insulation drywall certain carpentry work and concrete as well as fluctuating lumber prices and supply in addition strong construction market conditions could restrict the labor force available to our subcontractors and us in one or more of our markets significant increases in costs resulting from these shortages or delays in construction of homes could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

we rely on subcontractors to construct our homes the failure of our subcontractors to properly construct our homes may be costly 

we engage subcontractors to perform the actual construction of our homes despite our quality control efforts we may discover that our subcontractors were engaging in improper construction practices the occurrence of such events could require us to repair the homes in accordance with our standards and as required by law the cost of satisfying our legal obligations in these instances may be significant and we may be unable to recover the cost of repair from subcontractors suppliers and insurers 

 

product liability litigation and warranty claims may adversely impact our operations 

construction defect and home warranty claims are common and can represent a substantial risk for the homebuilding industry the cost of insuring against construction defect and product liability related claims as well as the claims themselves can be high in addition insurance companies limit coverage offered to protect against these claims further restrictions on coverage availability or significant increases in premium costs or claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

we are subject to litigation proceedings that could harm our business if an unfavorable ruling were to occur 

from time to time we may become involved in litigation and other legal proceedings relating to claims arising from our operations in the normal course of business as described in but not limited to part i item 3 “legal proceedings” of this form 10k we are currently subject to certain legal proceedings litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings may occur we cannot assure you that these or other litigation or legal proceedings will not materially affect our ability to conduct our business in the manner that we expect or otherwise adversely affect us should an unfavorable ruling occur 

our failure to maintain the security of our electronic and other confidential information could expose us to liability and materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

privacy security and compliance concerns have continued to increase as technology has evolved as part of our normal business activities we collect and store certain confidential information including personal information of homebuyersborrowers and information about employees vendors and suppliers this information is entitled to protection under a number of federal and state laws we may share some of this information with vendors who assist us with certain aspects of our business particularly our mortgage and title businesses our failure to maintain the security of the data which we are required to protect including via the penetration of our network security and the misappropriation of confidential and personal information could result in business disruption damage to our reputation financial obligations to third parties fines penalties regulatory proceedings and private litigation with potentially large costs and also in deterioration in customers’ confidence in us and other competitive disadvantages and thus could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

weatherrelated and other events beyond our control may adversely impact our operations 

extreme weather or other events such as significant snowfalls hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes forest fires floods terrorist attacks or war may affect our markets our operations and our profitability these events may impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or subcontractors causing us material increases in costs or delays in construction of homes which could have a material adverse effect upon our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows

legal proceedings

in october 2004 patrick tracy whom we had employed as a sales and marketing representative “smr” filed a lawsuit against us in the us district court for the western district of new york alleging that we had misclassified him and other smrs as outside sales personnel exempt from certain state and federal wage laws including overtime pay requirements mr tracy’s attorneys subsequently filed several other lawsuits in various courts asserting substantially similar claims on behalf of various classes or groups of smrs none of those courts have held that the claims are appropriate for class collective or other group treatment and the western district of new york ruled in april 2013 that the claims in mr tracy’s case could not proceed on such a basis the western district of new york reached the same conclusion in july 2014 regarding a separate case that mr tracy’s attorneys brought on behalf of other smrs 

in october 2013 mr tracy’s individual claims were tried by a jury which returned a unanimous verdict in our favor and found that we had properly classified mr tracy as an exempt outside sales person the plaintiff has sought review in the us court of appeals for the second circuit in which he challenges the legal standard that the trial court applied in crafting its jury instructions regarding the outside sales exemption in addition to rulings that the trial court made at earlier stages of the case that appeal is fully briefed and the parties are awaiting a ruling or an oral argument date the remainder of the cases noted above are in various stages of pretrial proceedings many of them stayed or administratively closed pending a final disposition of the tracy action 

we believe that our compensation practices in regard to smrs are entirely lawful and have vigorously defended all claims challenging those practices in light of the points noted above we have not recorded any associated liabilities on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets in conjunction with any of those claims

in june 2010 we received a request for information from the united states environmental protection agency “epa” pursuant to section 308 of the clean water act the request sought information about storm water discharge practices in connection with homebuilding projects completed or underway by us in new york and new jersey we cooperated with this request and provided information to the epa we were subsequently informed by the united states department of justice “doj” that the epa forwarded the information on the matter to the doj and the doj requested that we meet with the government to discuss the status of the case meetings took place in january 2012 august 2012 and november 2014 with representatives from both the epa and doj we have continued discussions with the epa and doj it is as yet unclear what next steps the doj will take in the matter we intend to continue cooperating with any future epa andor doj inquiries at this time we cannot predict the outcome of this inquiry nor can we reasonably estimate the potential costs that may be associated with its eventual resolution

we are also involved in various other litigation arising in the ordinary course of business in the opinion of management and based on advice of legal counsel this litigation is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows legal costs incurred in connection with outstanding litigation are expensed as incurred

results of operations for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 

overview 

business 

our primary business is the construction and sale of singlefamily detached homes townhomes and condominium buildings all of which are primarily constructed on a presold basis to fully serve customers of our homebuilding operations we also operate a mortgage banking and title services business we primarily conduct our operations in mature markets additionally we generally grow our business through market share gains in our existing markets and by expanding into markets contiguous to our current active markets our four homebuilding reportable segments consist of the following regions 

 



 

our lot acquisition strategy is predicated upon avoiding the financial requirements and risks associated with direct land ownership and development historically we generally have not engaged in land development to obtain finished lots for use in our homebuilding operations instead we have acquired finished lots at market prices from various third party land developers pursuant to fixed price purchase agreements these purchase agreements require deposits typically ranging up to 10 of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots in the form of cash or letters of credit that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the purchase agreement this strategy has allowed us to maximize inventory turnover which we believe enables us to minimize market risk and to operate with less capital thereby enhancing rates of return on equity and total capital 

in addition to constructing homes primarily on a presold basis and utilizing what we believe is a conservative lot acquisition strategy we focus on obtaining and maintaining a leading market position in each market we serve this strategy allows us to gain valuable efficiencies and competitive advantages in our markets which we believe contributes to minimizing the adverse effects of regional economic cycles and provides growth opportunities within these markets our continued success is contingent upon our ability to control an adequate supply of finished lots on which to build as a result in certain specific strategic circumstances we deviate from our historical lot acquisition strategy and engage in joint venture arrangements with land developers or directly acquire raw ground already zoned for its intended use for development once we acquire control of any raw ground we determine whether to sell the raw parcel to a developer and enter into a fixed price purchase agreement with the developer to purchase the finished lots or to hire a developer to develop the land on our behalf while joint venture arrangements and direct land development activity are not our preferred method of acquiring finished building lots we may enter into additional transactions in the future on a limited basis where there exists a compelling strategic or prudent financial reason to do so we expect however to continue to acquire substantially all of our finished lot inventory using fixed price purchase agreements with forfeitable deposits 

 

as of december 31 2014 we controlled approximately 62800 lots under purchase agreements with deposits in cash and letters of credit totaling approximately 348400 and 1700 respectively in addition we controlled approximately 5500 lots through joint venture limited liability corporations with an aggregate investment of approximately 82000 further as of december 31 2014 we had approximately 33700 in land under development that once fully developed will result in approximately 480 lots for use in our homebuilding operations of the total finished lots expected to be developed 94 lots are under contract to be sold to an unrelated party under lot purchase agreements included in the number of controlled lots are approximately 7800 lots for which we have recorded a contract land deposit impairment reserve of approximately 56100 as of december 31 2014 see notes 3 4 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information regarding fixed price purchase agreements joint ventures and land under development respectively a dditionally we have certain properties under contract with land owners that are expected to yield approximately 5700 lots which are not included in our number of total lots controlled some of these properties may require rezoning or other approvals to achieve the expected yield these properties are controlled with deposits and letters of credit totaling approximately 2300 and 3000 respectively as of december 31 2014 of which approximately 2600 is refundable if we do not perform under the contract we generally expect to assign the raw land contracts to a land developer and simultaneously enter into a lot purchase agreement with the assignee if the project is determined to be feasible 

current business environment and key financial results 

 

the housing market recovery continues to be uneven during 2014 the housing market experienced some weakness as existing home inventory increased and affordability decreased following increasing prices during 2013 there has also been an increase in the number of new home communities in many markets these factors have resulted in weakness in housing prices in 2014 the housing market also continues to face challenges from mortgage underwriting standards 

our new orders net of cancellations “new orders” for 2014 increased 5 from 2013 while our average new order sales price increased 4 to 3737 in 2014 consolidated revenues for the year ended december 31 2014 totaled 4375059 an increase of 6 from 4134481 in 2013 our gross profit margin within our homebuilding business increased to 184 in 2014 compared to 172 in 2013 gross profit in 2013 was negatively impacted by two previously disclosed service related accruals totaling approximately 31600 a 76 basis point reduction to gross profit in 2013 net income for 2014 increased 6 from 2013 to 281630 diluted earnings per share in 2014 was 6350 an increase of 16 from 2013 diluted earnings per share was favorably impacted by our ongoing share repurchase program under which we repurchased 507648 shares of our stock at an aggregate purchase price of 567544 during 2014 

we believe that a continuation of the housing market recovery which began in 2012 is dependent upon a sustained overall economic recovery driven by continued improvement in job growth and consumer confidence levels as well as improvement in wage growth and household formation we expect to face a challenging market in 2015 as a result of the weakness in new home sales prices and increased competition associated with an expected increase in new home communities in our markets due to the strength of our balance sheet we believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities that may arise from future economic and homebuilding market volatility 

 

homebuilding operations 

the following table summarizes the results of our consolidated homebuilding operations and certain operating activity for each of the last three years 

 



 

consolidated homebuilding revenues 

homebuilding revenues increased 6 in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily as a result of a 6 increase in the average settlement price while the number of units settled was flat year over year the increase in the average settlement price was primarily attributable to the average price of homes in backlog being approximately 8 higher entering 2014 compared to 2013 and a 5 higher average sales price of new orders for the first six months of 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 the higher average price of homes in backlog entering 2014 was attributable to the aforementioned increasing prices in 2013 

homebuilding revenues in 2013 increased 32 from 2012 as a result of a 20 increase in the number of homes settled and a 10 increase in the average settlement price year over year the increase in the number of homes settled was primarily attributable to a 35 higher beginning backlog unit balance entering 2013 compared to 2012 offset partially by a lower backlog turnover rate in 2013 compared to 2012 average settlement prices in 2013 were favorably impacted primarily by a 10 higher average price of homes in backlog entering 2013 compared to the average price of homes in backlog entering 2012 and a 10 higher average sales price of new orders for the first six months of 2013 compared to 2012 the higher beginning backlog balance and average sales prices were driven by the favorable market conditions experienced in the second half of 2012 

consolidated homebuilding new orders 

the number of new orders and the average sales price of new orders increased 5 and 4 respectively during 2014 when compared to 2013 new orders were higher due to the 8 increase in the average number of active communities year over year offset partially by lower sales absorption rates in many of our markets average sales prices were higher in each of our market segments year over year as a result of favorable market conditions in 2013 which led to higher prices entering 2014

the number of new orders and the average sales price of new orders in 2013 increased 8 and 10 respectively when compared to 2012 new orders and the average sales price were higher year over year in each of our market segments the increase in new orders was driven by a 12 increase in the number of active communities year over year offset partially by a lower absorption rate in 2013 in addition our december 2012 acquisition of heartland homes added 355 new orders in 2013 the increase in active communities and pricing in 2013 was attributable to the favorable market conditions through the first half of 2013 

consolidated homebuilding gross profit 

gross profit margins in 2014 increased to 184 compared to 172 in 2013 gross profit margins were favorably impacted by our average settlement prices increasing at a higher rate than material and lot costs year over year as well as by a relative shift in settlements to our midatlantic and north east segments which have higher average gross profit margins as noted in the overview section above gross profit margins in 2013 were negatively impacted by two service related accruals which reduced the 2013 gross profit margin by 76 basis points we expect continued gross margin pressure over the next several quarters due to weakness in sales prices

gross profit margins in 2013 decreased to 172 from 175 in 2012 gross profit margins were negatively impacted in 2013 by two service related accruals totaling approximately 31600 see note 13 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of service accruals excluding these charges gross profit margin was 179 in 2013 an increase of 46 basis points from the prior year gross profit margins were favorably impacted by higher settlement volume in 2013 allowing us to better 

 

leverage our operating costs partially offset by higher construction costs including lumber and certain other commodity costs year over year 

consolidated homebuilding selling general and administrative “sga” 

 

sga expenses in 2014 increased approximately 45800 or 15 compared to 2013 and increased as a percentage of revenue to 82 from 76 year over year the increase in sga expenses was attributable to an approximate 26000 increase in equitybased compensation expense and an approximate 14100 increase in sales and marketing expenses in 2014 equitybased compensation expense increased primarily due to the granting of nonqualified stock options “options” under the 2014 equity incentive plan the “2014 plan” following shareholder approval of the 2014 plan in may 2014 and restricted share unit “rsus” grants in the second quarter of 2013 in addition in 2013 we recorded a reversal of approximately 7100 in equitybased compensation expense as a result of an adjustment to our stock option forfeiture rates based on our actual forfeiture experience sales and marketing expenses increased due primarily to an increase in model home expenditures attributable to the 8 increase in the number of active communities 

sga expenses in 2013 increased approximately 11800 or 4 compared to 2012 but as a percentage of revenue decreased to 76 in 2013 from 97 in 2012 the increase in sga expenses was attributable to increases of approximately 20300 in personnel costs in 2013 due to an increase in headcount year over year in addition sales and marketing expenses were approximately 14400 higher in 2013 due to the increase in the number of active communities these cost increases were partially offset by an approximate 28700 reduction in equitybased compensation expense in 2013 compared to 2012 equitybased compensation expense was favorably impacted as a result of the restricted share units “rsus” issued in 2010 becoming fully vested as of december 31 2012 and the reversal of approximately 7100 in equitybased compensation expense previously recorded to sga expense as we adjusted our stock option forfeiture rates based on our actual forfeiture experience these reductions were offset partially by equitybased compensation expense incurred in 2013 related to rsus issued in may 2013 the decrease in sga costs as a percentage of revenue was driven by the 32 increase in revenue in 2013 allowing us to better leverage our overhead costs 

consolidated homebuilding backlog 

 

backlog units and dollars increased approximately 11 to 5475 units and 14 to 2105635 respectively as of december 31 2014 compared to 4945 units and 1845600 respectively as of december 31 2013 backlog units were higher primarily due to a 13 increase in new orders for the six month period ended december 31 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 backlog dollars were favorably impacted by the 11 increase in the backlog unit balance and a 3 higher average price of homes in backlog year over year the average price of homes in backlog was favorably impacted by a 2 increase in the average sales price of new orders for the six month period ended december 31 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 

backlog units decreased approximately 1 to 4945 as of december 31 2013 compared to 4979 as of december 31 2012 while backlog dollars increased approximately 7 to 1845600 from 1723914 as of december 31 2013 and december 31 2012 respectively backlog dollars were higher primarily due to a 10 increase in the average price of new orders for the sixmonth period ended december 31 2013 compared to the same period in 2012

backlog which represents homes sold but not yet settled with the customer may be impacted by customer cancellations for various reasons that are beyond our control such as failure to obtain mortgage financing inability to sell an existing home job loss or a variety of other reasons in any period a portion of the cancellations that we experience are related to new sales that occurred during the same period and a portion are related to sales that occurred in prior periods and therefore appeared in the beginning backlog for the current period expressed as the total of all cancellations during the period as a percentage of gross sales during the period our cancellation rate was approximately 15 in each of 2014 2013 and 2012 additionally during each of 2014 2013 and 2012 approximately 6 of a reporting quarter’s opening backlog cancelled during the fiscal quarter we can provide no assurance that our historical cancellation rates are indicative of the actual cancellation rate that may occur in future years other than those units that are cancelled we expect to settle substantially all of our december 31 2014 backlog during 2015 see “risk factors” in item 1a of this form 10k 

the backlog turnover rate is impacted by various factors including but not limited to changes in new order activity internal production capacity external subcontractor capacity and other external factors over which we do not exercise control

reportable homebuilding segments 

homebuilding profit before tax includes all revenues and income generated from the sale of homes less the cost of homes sold sga expenses and a corporate capital allocation charge determined at the corporate headquarters the corporate capital allocation charge eliminates in consolidation and is based on the segment’s average net assets employed the corporate capital allocation charged to the operating segment allows the chief operating decision maker to determine whether the operating segment’s results are providing the desired rate of return after covering our cost of capital we record charges on contract land deposits when we determine 

 

that it is probable that recovery of the deposit is impaired for segment reporting purposes impairments on contract land deposits are generally charged to the operating segment upon the determination to terminate a finished lot purchase agreement with the developer or to restructure a lot purchase agreement resulting in the forfeiture of the deposit we evaluate our entire net contract land deposit portfolio for impairment each quarter for additional information regarding our contract land deposit impairment analysis see the critical accounting policies section within this management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for presentation purposes below the contract land deposit reserve at december 31 2014 and 2013 has been allocated to the reportable segments for the respective years to show contract land deposits on a net basis the net contract land deposit balances below also include approximately 4700 and 2500 at december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively of letters of credit issued as deposits in lieu of cash the following tables summarize certain homebuilding operating activity by reportable segment for each of the last three years

mid atlantic 

2014 versus 2013

the mid atlantic segment had an approximate 4400 or 2 decrease in segment profit in 2014 compared to 2013 segment profit was negatively impacted by higher sga expense attributable to an 11 increase in the average number of active communities year over year and an increase in the corporate capital allocation due primarily to higher inventory levels segment revenues increased approximately 177700 or 7 year over year due primarily to a 6 increase in the average settlement price in 2014 compared to 2013 the average settlement price was favorably impacted by a 7 higher average price of homes in backlog entering 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 the mid atlantic segment’s gross profit margin percentage was flat year over year however as noted below the gross profit margin in 2013 was negatively impacted by a service related accrual which reduced 2013 gross profit margin by 64 basis points excluding this charge gross profit margin decreased 49 basis points to 191 in 2014 current year gross profit margin was negatively impacted by an increase in certain material costs

segment new orders and the average sales price for new orders in 2014 increased 5 and 4 respectively compared to 2013 new orders were favorably impacted by an 11 increase in the average number of active communities in 2014 compared to 2013 offset partially by lower absorption rates attributable to lower traffic levels year over year the increase in the average sales price of new orders was attributable to the favorable market conditions in 2013 which led to higher average sales prices entering 2014

the mid atlantic segment had an approximate 87300 or 46 increase in segment profit in 2013 compared to 2012 the increase in segment profit was driven by the increase of approximately 561500 or 30 in revenues year over year due to a 20 increase in the number of units settled and a 9 increase in the average settlement price the increase in units settled was attributable to a 36 higher backlog unit balance entering 2013 compared to the backlog unit balance entering 2012 offset partially by a lower backlog turnover rate year over year settlements were also favorably impacted by a 14 increase in new orders for the first six months of 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 average settlement prices were higher due to a 6 higher average price of homes in backlog entering 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 and a 10 higher average sales price for new orders during the first six months of 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 gross profit margins in 2013 were negatively impacted by a previously disclosed service related accrual of approximately 15600 or 64 basis points of revenue excluding this charge gross profit margin increased 119 basis points to 196 in 2013 due to increased settlement volume which allowed us to better leverage certain operating costs 

segment new orders and the average sales price increased 5 and 9 respectively in 2013 from 2012 new orders increased due to an 11 increase in the number of active communities partially offset by a lower absorption rate the increase in the average sales price was attributable to a shift to higher priced communities in certain markets and favorable market conditions through the first half of 2013 which allowed us to increase prices in several markets within the mid atlantic segment 

 

north east 

2014 versus 2013 

the north east segment had an approximate 19100 or 134 increase in segment profit in 2014 compared to 2013 as discussed below segment profit in 2013 was negatively impacted by a charge of approximately 12700 related to a service related accrual excluding that charge in the prior year segment profit increased approximately 6400 or 24 year over year the increase in segment profit was driven by an increase of approximately 44200 or 13 in revenues year over year due to an 8 increase in the number of units settled coupled with a 5 increase in the average settlement price the increase in units settled was attributable to a 14 higher backlog unit balance entering 2014 compared to the backlog unit balance entering 2013 the increase in the average settlement price was driven by a 5 higher average price of homes in backlog entering 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 and a shift in settlements to higher priced markets the north east segment’s gross profit margin increased to 187 in 2014 from 138 in 2013 excluding the previously discussed service accrual which reduced gross profit margin in 2013 by 382 basis points gross profit margin increased 109 basis points year over year gross profit margin was favorably impacted by a shift in settlements to higher priced markets with higher gross margins and by increased settlement volume which allowed us to better leverage certain operating costs in 2014 

segment new orders and the average sales price of new orders increased approximately 10 and 4 respectively in 2014 compared to 2013 the increase in new orders was driven by an 11 increase in the average number of active communities the increase in the average sales price of new orders was attributable to a shift in sales to higher priced markets and to higher priced communities in certain markets

2013 versus 2012 

the north east segment had an approximate 7200 or 34 decrease in segment profit in 2013 compared to 2012 the decrease was attributable to a charge in the fourth quarter of 2013 to increase the warranty accrual for a previously disclosed nonrecurring service issue excluding this charge to the segment of approximately 12700 segment profit increased approximately 5500 or 25 compared to 2012 revenues in the segment increased approximately 54000 or 19 year over year due to a 14 increase in the number of units settled coupled with a 5 increase in the average settlement price the increase in units settled was attributable to a 15 higher backlog unit balance entering 2013 as compared to the backlog unit balance entering 2012 in addition to a 15 increase in new orders for the first six months of 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 the average settlement price increased year over year due to a 9 higher average price of homes in backlog entering 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 and a 1 higher average sales price for new orders during the first six months of 2013 compared to 2012 the north east segment’s gross profit margin percentage was down 356 basis points year over year excluding the warranty accrual charge discussed above of approximately 12700 or 382 basis points of revenue gross profit margin for the segment was 176 an increase of 27 basis points compared to 2012 

segment new orders and the average sales price increased approximately 14 and 3 respectively in 2013 from 2012 new orders were favorably impacted by higher sales absorption levels attributable to favorable market conditions through the first half of 2013 and a decrease in the cancellation rate year over year 

mid east 

2014 versus 2013 

the mid east segment had an approximate 8000 or 14 decrease in segment profit in 2014 compared to 2013 the decrease in segment profit was driven by a decrease in revenues of approximately 15700 or 2 year over year due primarily to a 6 decrease in the number of units settled offset partially by a 4 increase in the average settlement price the decrease in settlements was primarily attributable to a 10 lower backlog unit balance entering 2014 compared to the backlog unit balance entering 2013 the average settlement price was favorably impacted by an 8 higher average price of homes in backlog entering 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 and a 3 higher average sales price for new orders during the first six months of 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 the segment’s gross profit margin in 2014 of 158 was flat with 2013 as higher average settlement prices were offset by increases in certain material costs year over year segment new orders and the average sales price of new orders increased 2 and 4 respectively in 2014 compared to 2013 

2013 versus 2012 

the mid east segment had an approximate 15700 or 39 increase in segment profit in 2013 compared to 2012 the increase in segment profit was driven by an increase in revenues of approximately 277800 or 44 year over year due to a 22 increase in the number of units settled and an 18 increase in the average settlement price the increase in settlements was primarily attributable to a 43 higher backlog unit balance entering 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 coupled with a 21 increase in new orders during the first half of 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 the higher backlog balance entering 2013 was in part attributable to our heartland homes acquisition which added approximately 200 units and 81600 to backlog at december 31 2013 average 

 

settlement prices were higher due to a 21 higher average price of homes in backlog entering 2013 compared to 2012 resulting from a shift in mix to higher priced communities as well as to the higher average price of homes in the backlog acquired from heartland homes in addition the average settlement price was favorably impacted by a 17 increase in the average new order sales price during the first half of 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 gross profit margin decreased to 157 in 2013 from 164 in 2012 due to the lower average gross profit margins associated with the heartland homes backlog acquired and higher construction costs including lumber and certain other commodity costs these cost increases were partially offset by the favorable impact of increased settlement volume which allowed us to better leverage certain operating costs 

segment new orders and the average sales price for new orders increased 11 and 17 respectively during 2013 compared to 2012 new orders primarily increased due to 355 new orders from heartland homes the increase in the average new order sales price was attributable to a shift in mix to higher priced communities in certain markets including higher average sales prices associated with the heartland homes new orders coupled with favorable market conditions through the first half of 2013 which allowed us to increase prices in certain markets 

south east 

2014 versus 2013 

the south east segment had an approximate 2500 or 7 increase in segment profit in 2014 compared to 2013 segment revenues increased approximately 34400 or 8 year over year due to a 2 increase in the number of units settled and a 6 increase in the average settlement price the average settlement price in 2014 was favorably impacted by a 9 higher average price of homes in backlog entering 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 the south east segment’s gross profit margin increased to 183 in 2014 from 170 in 2013 due primarily to our average settlement prices increasing at a higher rate than lot and certain material costs year over year

segment new orders and the average sales price for new orders increased 6 and 5 respectively in 2014 compared to 2013 new orders were favorably impacted by an 8 increase in the number of active communities in 2014 compared to 2013 offset partially by lower absorption levels attributable to lower traffic levels year over year the increase in the average sales price for new orders in 2014 was attributable to the introduction of our nvhomes product line in the raleigh market in 2014 which sells at a higher price point and to a shift in mix in new orders to higher priced markets

2013 versus 2012 

the south east segment had an approximate 14300 or 69 increase in segment profit in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to an increase in revenues of approximately 120000 or 36 year over year segment revenues were higher due to a 23 increase in the number of units settled and a 10 increase in the average settlement price the increase in settlements was attributable to a 37 higher backlog unit balance entering 2013 compared to 2012 and a 29 increase in new orders for the first six months of 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 these increases were partially offset by a lower backlog turnover rate year over year the average settlement price was favorably impacted by a 12 higher average price of homes in backlog entering 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 as well as by a 9 increase in the average sales price of homes in the first six months of 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 the south east segment’s gross profit margin increased 32 basis points in 2013 from 2012 primarily due to the favorable impact of increased settlement volume which allowed us to better leverage certain operating costs 

segment new orders and the average sales price for new orders each increased approximately 9 in 2013 from 2012 new orders increased due to a 7 increase in the number of active communities and higher sales absorption levels driven by favorable market conditions through the first half of 2013 the increase in the average sales price for new orders was attributable to a shift in mix of new orders to higher priced communities in certain markets 

homebuilding segment reconciliations to consolidated homebuilding operations 

in addition to the corporate capital allocation and contract land deposit impairments discussed above the other reconciling items between homebuilding segment profit and homebuilding consolidated profit before tax include unallocated corporate overhead which includes all management incentive compensation equitybased compensation expense consolidation adjustments and external corporate interest expense our overhead functions such as accounting treasury and human resources are centrally performed and the costs are not allocated to our operating segments consolidation adjustments consist of such items to convert the reportable segments’ results which are predominantly maintained on a cash basis to a full accrual basis for external financial statement presentation purposes and are not allocated to our operating segments external corporate interest expense is primarily comprised of interest charges on our 395 senior notes due 2022 the “senior notes” and is not charged to the operating segments because the charges are included in the corporate capital allocation discussed above 

 



 



 



 







 



  



 

mortgage banking segment 

we conduct our mortgage banking activity through nvrm a wholly owned subsidiary nvrm focuses almost exclusively on serving the homebuilding segment’s customer base the following table summarizes the results of our mortgage banking operations and certain statistical data for each of the last three years 

 



 

2014 versus 2013 

loan closing volume for the year ended december 31 2014 increased 12 from 2013 the increase was primarily attributable to a 6 increase in the number of units closed and a 5 increase in the average loan amount year over year the increase in the number of units closed is attributable to an increase in the number of loans closed by nvrm for our homebuyers who obtain a mortgage to purchase a home “capture rate” the capture rate increased from 81 in 2013 to 84 in 2014 the increase in the average loan amount is primarily attributable to the aforementioned increase in the homebuilding segment’s average settlement prices in 2014 as compared to 2013

segment profit for the year ended december 31 2014 decreased approximately 11700 from 2013 the decrease in segment profit was primarily attributable to an approximate 7300 decrease in mortgage banking fees and an approximate 4400 increase in general and administrative expenses the decrease in mortgage banking fees was primarily attributable to a decrease in secondary marketing fees due to a product mix shift out of fixed rate government product due to increased consumer costs on fha mortgage loans and an increase in adjustable rate loans which generally are less profitable than fixed rate products the relative product mix shift from fixed rate to adjustable rate products is attributable to interest rate volatility in 2014 the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to an increase in compensation costs as a result of a 12 increase in average headcount in 2014 compared to 2013

 

2013 versus 2012 

loan closing volume for the year ended december 31 2013 increased 15 from 2012 the increase was primarily attributable to a 7 increase in the number of units closed and an 8 increase in the average loan amount year over year the increase in the number of units closed and the increase in the average loan amount were primarily attributable to increases in the homebuilding segment’s number of units settled and average settlement prices in 2013 as compared to 2012 partially offset by a decrease in nvrm’s capture rate the capture rate decreased from 87 in 2012 to 81 in 2013 primarily due to a more competitive market for mortgage loans as other lenders’ refinancing activity slowed 

 

segment profit for the year ended december 31 2013 increased approximately 3900 from 2012 the increase in segment profit was primarily attributable to an approximate 13400 increase in mortgage banking fees partially offset by an approximate 10000 increase in general and administrative expenses the increase in mortgage banking fees was primarily attributable to a 15 increase in closed loan volume and an increase in secondary marketing fees the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to an increase in compensation costs as a result of a 43 increase in headcount compared to 2012 

 

mortgage banking – other 

we sell all of the loans we originate into the secondary mortgage market insofar as we underwrite our originated loans to the standards and specifications of the ultimate investor we have no further financial obligations from the issuance of loans except in certain limited instances where early payment default occurs those underwriting standards are typically equal to or more stringent than the underwriting standards required by fnma va and fha because we sell all of our loans and do not service them there is often a substantial delay between the time that a loan goes into default and the time that the investor requests us to reimburse them for losses incurred because of the default we believe that all of the loans that we originate are underwritten to the standards and specifications of the ultimate investor to whom we sell our originated loans we employ a quality control department to ensure that our underwriting controls are effective and further assess the underwriting function as part of our assessment of internal controls over financial reporting 

 

nvrm maintains an allowance for losses on mortgage loans originated that reflects our judgment of the present loss exposure from the loans that we have originated and sold the allowance is calculated based on an analysis of historical experience and exposure at december 31 2014 we had an allowance for loan losses of approximately 10000 although we consider the allowance for loan losses reflected on the december 31 2014 balance sheet to be adequate there can be no assurance that this allowance will prove to be adequate to cover losses on loans previously originated 

 

nvrm is dependent on our homebuilding segment’s customers for business if new orders and sales prices of the homebuilding segment decline nvrm’s operations will also be adversely affected in addition the mortgage segment’s operating results may be adversely affected in future periods due to the continued tightening and volatility of the credit markets changes in investor funding times as well as increased regulation of mortgage lending practices the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act enacted on july 21 2010 contains numerous provisions affecting residential mortgages and mortgage lending practices the cfpb implemented rules in january 2014 including “ability to repay” underwriting provisions definition and parameters of “qualified mortgages” and the establishment of certain protections from liability under “ability to repay” provisions for “qualified mortgages” the cfpb’s rulemaking also included limitations on certain fees and loan officer compensation requirements additional rules regarding loan estimates and the integrated mortgage disclosures consumers receive in connection with applying for and closing on a mortgage loan are scheduled to be implemented in august 2015 although we do not expect these new requirements to significantly impact our mortgage business increased regulation may impact the cost and availability of the mortgage services available to our homebuyers

seasonality 

overall we do not experience material seasonal fluctuations in sales settlements or loan closings 

effective tax rate 

our consolidated effective tax rate in 2014 2013 and 2012 was 3790 3636 and 3435 respectively during 2014 we recognized income tax expense of approximately 7000 due to the reversal of certain previously recognized tax deductions during 2012 we reduced our provision for unrecognized tax benefits by 9154 which reduced the 2012 effective tax rate the reduction resulted from settlements with and an audit by certain taxing authorities during 2012 which led us to update our evaluation of the administrative practice in other states for similar uncertain tax positions to determine whether the positions taken in those states were effectively settled 

recent accounting pronouncements pending adoption 

 

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update “asu” 201409 revenue from contracts with customers  which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers the standard will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” when it becomes effective the standard is effective for the company on january 1 2017 early adoption is not permitted the standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method we have not yet selected a transition method and are currently evaluating the effect that the standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 

 

 

in august 2014 fasb issued asu 201415 presentation of financial statements – going concern subtopic 20540 disclosure of uncertainties about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern the standard requires an entity’s management to evaluate at each annual and interim reporting period whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued and to provide related footnote disclosures the standard is effective for the first annual period ending after december 15 2016 and interim periods thereafter we do not believe that the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures

liquidity and capital resources 

lines of credit and notes payable

our mortgage subsidiary nvrm provides for its mortgage origination and other operating activities using cash generated from operations borrowings from its parent company nvr as well as a revolving mortgage repurchase facility which is nonrecourse to nvr on july 30 2014 nvrm renewed and amended its repurchase agreement with us bank national association which provides for loan purchases up to 25000 subject to certain sublimits the “repurchase agreement” the purpose of the repurchase agreement is to finance the origination of mortgage loans by nvrm the repurchase agreement expires on july 29 2015 advances under the repurchase agreement carry a pricing rate based on the libor rate plus the libor margin as determined under the repurchase agreement provided that the pricing rate shall not be less than 2825 there are several restrictions on purchased loans including that they cannot be sold to others they cannot be pledged to anyone other than the agent and they cannot support any other borrowing or repurchase agreement the repurchase agreement contains various affirmative and negative covenants the negative covenants include among others certain limitations on transactions involving acquisitions mergers the incurrence of debt sale of assets and creation of liens upon any of its mortgage notes additional covenants include i a tangible net worth requirement ii a minimum liquidity requirement iii a minimum net income requirement and iv a maximum leverage ratio requirement we were in compliance with all covenants under the repurchase agreement at december 31 2014 at december 31 2014 there was no debt outstanding under the repurchase agreement and there were no borrowing base limitations 

equity repurchases 

in addition to funding growth in our homebuilding and mortgage banking operations we historically have used a substantial portion of our excess liquidity to repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock in open market and privately negotiated transactions this ongoing repurchase activity is conducted pursuant to publicly announced board authorizations and is typically executed in accordance with the safeharbor provisions of rule 10b18 promulgated under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended in addition the board resolutions authorizing us to repurchase shares of our common stock specifically prohibit us from purchasing shares from our officers directors profit sharing401k plan trust or employee stock ownership plan trust the repurchase program assists us in accomplishing our primary objective creating increases in shareholder value see item 5 of this form 10k for disclosure of amounts repurchased during the fourth quarter of 2014 for the year ended december 31 2014 we repurchased 507648 shares of our common stock at an aggregate purchase price of 567544 as of december 31 2014 we had approximately 170600 available under a board approved repurchase authorization

for the year ended december 31 2013 cash and cash equivalents decreased by 287254 net cash provided by operating activities was 270222 cash was provided by homebuilding operations and by an increase of 114456 in accounts payable accrued expenses and customer deposits in 2013 compared to 2012 accounts payables were higher due primarily to an increase in our inventory levels while accrued expenses were higher due to increased warranty reserves and income taxes payable attributable to our increased earnings cash was used to fund the increase to homebuilding inventory of 52861 due to increased units under construction at the end of 2013 compared to 2012 in addition cash was used to fund the 40034 increase in contract land deposits year over year investing activities during 2013 used net cash of 34477 primarily as a result of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures totaling 22850 cash was also used for the purchase of property plant and equipment totaling 19016 during 2013 these uses of cash from investing activities were partially offset by capital distributions of 6782 received from our unconsolidated joint ventures net cash used in financing activities was 522999 due primarily to our purchase of treasury stock during 2013 we repurchased 581387 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of 554491 this use of cash in financing activities was partially offset by 13957 in proceeds from stock option exercises and the realization of 20636 in excess income tax benefits from equitybased compensation plan activity and deferred compensation plan distributions 

for the year ended december 31 2012 cash and cash equivalents increased by 672713 net cash provided by operating activities was 264384 cash was provided by homebuilding operations and by an approximate 63400 decrease in mortgage loans held for sale in addition cash was provided by an increase of 110396 in accounts payable accrued expenses and customer deposits in 2012 compared to 2011 payables were higher due primarily to an increase in our inventory levels the increase in accrued expenses and customer deposits were attributable to increased management incentive accruals associated with improved financial results and an increase in customer deposits associated with increased sales volume cash provided by homebuilding operations was used to fund the increase to homebuilding inventory of 97750 as a result of an increase in the units under construction at the end of 2012 compared to 2011 in addition cash was used to fund the 53942 increase in contract land deposits year over year investing activities during 2012 used net cash of 22611 primarily as a result of the acquisition of heartland homes on december 31 2012 in addition cash was used for the purchase of property plant and equipment totaling 12365 during 2012 these uses of cash in investing activities were partially offset by capital distributions received from our unconsolidated joint ventures net cash provided by financing activities was 430940 due primarily to the receipt of 593866 in net proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes and 73211 in proceeds from stock option exercises during 2012 we spent 227281 to repurchase 285495 shares of our common stock in addition cash was used in the repayment of 21910 of loans assumed in the acquisition of heartland homes 

at december 31 2014 and 2013 the homebuilding segment had restricted cash of 24106 and 20563 respectively which is included in “other assets” on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets the restricted cash balances relate primarily to holding requirements for outstanding letters of credit issued under our letter of credit agreement and customer deposits for certain home sales 

we believe that our current cash holdings cash generated from operations and the public debt and equity markets will be sufficient to satisfy near and long term cash requirements for working capital and debt service in both our homebuilding and mortgage banking operations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

lot acquisition strategy 

we generally do not engage in land development instead we typically acquire finished building lots at market prices from various land developers under fixed price purchase agreements that require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the agreement the deposits required under the purchase agreements are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percentage typically ranging up to 10 of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots 

we believe that our lot acquisition strategy reduces the financial requirements and risks associated with direct land ownership and land development we may at our option choose for any reason and at any time not to perform under these purchase agreements by delivering notice of our intent not to acquire the finished lots under contract our sole legal obligation and economic loss for failure 

 

to perform under these purchase agreements is limited to the amount of the deposit pursuant to the liquidated damage provision contained in the purchase agreements we do not have any financial guarantees or completion obligations and we typically do not guarantee lot purchases on a specific performance basis under these purchase agreements 

at december 31 2014 we controlled approximately 68700 lots through lot purchase agreements joint ventures and land under development with an aggregate purchase price of approximately 6300000 these lots are controlled by making or committing to make deposits of approximately 425300 in the form of cash and letters of credit our entire risk of loss pertaining to the aggregate purchase price contractual commitment resulting from our nonperformance under the contracts is limited to our 350100 in deposits paid plus 75200 related to deposits to be paid subsequent to december 31 2014 assuming that contractual development milestones are met by the developers see contractual obligations section below of the 350100 deposit total approximately 348400 was in cash and approximately 1700 was in letters of credit which had been issued as of december 31 2014 as of december 31 2014 we had recorded an impairment valuation allowance of approximately 56100 related to certain cash deposits currently outstanding additionally as of december 31 2014 we had funding commitments totaling 11850 to two of our joint ventures in addition  we have certain properties under contract with land owners that are expected to yield approximately 5700 lots which are not included in our number of total lots controlled above some of these properties may require rezoning or other approvals to achieve the expected yield these properties are controlled with cash deposits and letters of credit totaling approximately 2300 and 3000 respectively as of december 31 2014 of which approximately 2600 is refundable if we do not perform under the contract and the remainder is at risk of loss we generally expect to assign the raw land contracts to a land developer and simultaneously enter into a lot purchase agreement with the assignee if the project is determined to be feasible please refer to note 1 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of the contract land deposits and note 3 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of our lot acquisition strategy in relation to our accounting related to variable interest entities 

bonds and letters of credit 

we enter into bond or letter of credit arrangements with local municipalities government agencies or land developers to collateralize our obligations under various contracts we had approximately 59400 of contingent obligations under such agreements as of december 31 2014 inclusive of the 4700 of lot acquisition deposits in the form of letters of credit discussed above we believe we will fulfill our obligations under the related contracts and do not anticipate any material losses under these bonds or letters of credit 

mortgage commitments and forward sales 

in the normal course of business our mortgage banking segment enters into contractual commitments to extend credit to buyers of singlefamily homes with fixed expiration dates the commitments become effective when the borrowers “lockin” a specified interest rate within time frames established by us all mortgagors are evaluated for credit worthiness prior to the extension of the commitment market risk arises if interest rates move adversely between the time of the “lockin” of rates by the borrower and the sale date of the loan to a brokerdealer to mitigate the effect of the interest rate risk inherent in providing rate lock commitments to borrowers we enter into optional or mandatory delivery forward sale contracts to sell whole loans and mortgagebacked securities to brokerdealers the forward sale contracts lock in an interest rate and price for the sale of loans similar to the specific rate lock commitments we do not engage in speculative or trading derivative activities both the rate lock commitments to borrowers and the forward sale contracts to brokerdealers are undesignated derivatives and accordingly are marked to fair value through earnings at december 31 2014 we had contractual commitments to extend credit to borrowers aggregating 237989 and open forward delivery contracts aggregating 424966 which hedge both the rate lock loan commitments and closed loans held for sale see note 14 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of our fair value accounting 

contractual obligations 

our fixed noncancelable obligations as of december 31 2014 were as follows

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods we continually evaluate the estimates we use to prepare the consolidated financial statements and update those estimates as necessary in general our estimates are based on historical experience on information from third party professionals and other various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances actual results could differ materially from those estimates made by management 

homebuilding inventory 

the carrying value of inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market value cost of lots and completed and uncompleted housing units represent the accumulated actual cost of the units field construction supervisors’ salaries and related direct overhead expenses are included in inventory costs interest costs are not capitalized into inventory with the exception of land under development upon settlement the cost of the unit is expensed on a specific identification basis cost of building materials is determined on a firstin firstout basis 

sold inventory is evaluated for impairment based on the contractual selling price compared to the total estimated cost to construct unsold inventory is evaluated for impairment by analyzing recent comparable sale prices within the applicable community compared to the costs incurred to date plus the expected costs to complete any calculated impairments are recorded immediately 

land under development and contract land deposits 

land under development 

on a very limited basis we directly acquire raw parcels of land already zoned for its intended use to develop into finished lots land under development includes the land acquisition costs direct improvement costs capitalized interest where applicable and real estate taxes 

land under development including the land under development held by our unconsolidated joint ventures and the related joint venture investments is reviewed for potential writedowns when impairment indicators are present in addition to considering market and economic conditions we assess land under development impairments on a communitybycommunity basis analyzing as applicable current sales absorption levels recent sales’ gross profit and the dollar differential between the projected fullydeveloped cost of the lots and the current market price for lots if indicators of impairment are present for a community we perform an analysis to determine if the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts and if they are impairment charges are required to be recorded in an amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of 

 

the assets our determination of fair value is primarily based on discounting the estimated future cash flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams 

at december 31 2014 we had approximately 33700 in land under development in four separate communities in addition at december 31 2014 we had an aggregate investment totaling approximately 82000 in five separate joint ventures that controlled land under development none of the communities classified as land under development nor any of the undeveloped land held by the joint ventures had any indicators of impairment at december 31 2014 as such we do not believe that any of the land under development is impaired at this time however there can be no assurance that we will not incur impairment charges in the future due to unanticipated adverse changes in the economy or other events adversely affecting specific markets or the homebuilding industry 

contract land deposits 

we purchase finished lots under fixed price purchase agreements that require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the contract the deposits are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percentage of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots 

we maintain an allowance for losses on contract land deposits that reflects our judgment of the present loss exposure in the existing contract land deposit portfolio at the end of the reporting period to analyze contract land deposit impairments we utilize a loss contingency analysis that is conducted each quarter in addition to considering market and economic conditions we assess contract land deposit impairments on a communitybycommunity basis pursuant to the purchase contract terms analyzing as applicable current sales absorption levels recent sales’ gross profit the dollar differential between the contractual purchase price and the current market price for lots a developer’s financial stability a developer’s financial ability or willingness to reduce lot prices to current market prices and the contract’s default status by either us or the developer along with an analysis of the expected outcome of any such default 

our analysis is focused on whether we can sell houses profitably in a particular community in the current market with which we are faced because we do not own the finished lots on which we had placed a contract land deposit if the above analysis leads to a determination that we cannot sell homes profitably at the current contractual lot price we then determine whether we will elect to default under the contract forfeit our deposit and terminate the contract or whether we will attempt to restructure the lot purchase contract which may require us to forfeit the deposit to obtain contract concessions from a developer we also assess whether an impairment is present due to collectability issues resulting from a developer’s nonperformance because of financial or other conditions 

although we consider the allowance for losses on contract land deposits reflected on the december 31 2014 consolidated balance sheet to be adequate see note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included herein there can be no assurance that this allowance will prove to be adequate over time to cover losses due to unanticipated adverse changes in the economy or other events adversely affecting specific markets or the homebuilding industry 

warrantyproduct liability accruals 

warranty and product liability accruals are established to provide for estimated future costs as a result of construction and product defects product recalls and litigation incidental to our business liability estimates are determined based on our judgment considering such factors as historical experience the likely current cost of corrective action manufacturers’ and subcontractors’ participation in sharing the cost of corrective action consultations with third party experts such as engineers and evaluations by our general counsel and outside counsel retained to handle specific product liability cases although we consider the warranty and product liability accrual reflected on the december 31 2014 consolidated balance sheet to be adequate see note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included herein there can be no assurance that this accrual will prove to be adequate over time to cover losses due to increased costs for material and labor the inability or refusal of manufacturers or subcontractors to financially participate in corrective action unanticipated adverse legal settlements or other unanticipated changes to the assumptions used to estimate the warranty and product liability accrual 

equitybased compensation expense 

compensation costs related to our equitybased compensation plans are recognized within our income statement the costs recognized are based on the grantdate fair value compensation cost for sharebased grants is recognized on a straightline basis over the requisite service period for the entire award from the date of grant through the period of the last separately vesting portion of the grant for the recognition of equitybased compensation expense the options which are subject to a performance condition are treated as a separate award from the “serviceonly” options and compensation expense is recognized when it becomes probable that the stated performance target will be achieved 

 

we calculate the fair value of our nonpublicly traded employee stock options using the blackscholes optionpricing model while the blackscholes model is a widely accepted method to calculate the fair value of options its results are dependent on input variables two of which expected term and expected volatility are significantly dependent on management’s judgment we have concluded that our historical exercise experience is the best estimate of future exercise patterns to determine an option’s expected term to estimate expected volatility we analyze the historical volatility of our common stock over a period equal to the option’s expected term changes in management’s judgment of the expected term and the expected volatility could have a material effect on the grantdate fair value calculated and expensed within the income statement in addition we are required to estimate future grant forfeitures when considering the amount of stockbased compensation costs to record we have concluded that our historical forfeiture rate is the best measure to base our estimate of future forfeitures of equitybased compensation grants however there can be no assurance that our future forfeiture rate will not be materially higher or lower than our historical forfeiture rate which would affect the aggregate cumulative compensation expense recognized 

in addition when recognizing stock based compensation cost related to “performance condition” option grants we are required to make a determination as to whether the performance conditions will be met prior to the completion of the actual performance period the performance metric is based on our return on capital performance during 2014 through 2016 while we currently believe that this performance condition will be satisfied at the target level and are recognizing compensation expense related to such options accordingly our future expected activity levels could cause us to make a different determination resulting in a change to the compensation expense to be recognized related to performance condition option grants that would otherwise have been recognized to date although we believe that the compensation costs recognized in 2014 are representative of the cumulative ratable amortization of the grantdate fair value of unvested options outstanding and expected to be exercised changes to the estimated input values such as expected term and expected volatility and changes to the determination of whether performance condition grants will vest could produce widely different fair values

mortgage loan loss allowance 

we originate several different loan products to our customers to finance the purchase of their home we sell all of the loans we originate into the secondary mortgage market generally within 30 days from origination all of the loans that we originate are underwritten to the standards and specifications of the ultimate investor insofar as we underwrite our originated loans to those standards we bear no increased concentration of credit risk from the issuance of loans except in certain limited instances where early payment default occurs those underwriting standards are typically equal to or more stringent than the underwriting standards required by fnma va and fha we employ a quality control department to ensure that our underwriting controls are effectively operating and further assess the underwriting function as part of our assessment of internal controls over financial reporting we maintain an allowance for losses on mortgage loans originated that reflects our judgment of the present loss exposure in the loans that we have originated and sold the allowance is calculated based on an analysis of historical experience and exposure although we consider the allowance for loan losses reflected on the december 31 2014 consolidated balance sheet to be adequate see note 15 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included herein there can be no assurance that this allowance will prove to be adequate over time to cover losses due to unanticipated changes to the assumptions used to estimate the mortgage loan loss allowance

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

tableend

market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates our market risk arises from interest rate risk inherent in our financial instruments and debt obligations interest rate risk results from the possibility that changes in interest rates will cause unfavorable changes in net income or in the value of interest ratesensitive assets liabilities and commitments lower interest rates tend to increase demand for mortgage loans for home purchasers while higher interest rates make it more difficult for potential borrowers to purchase residential properties and to qualify for mortgage loans we have no market rate sensitive instruments held for speculative or trading purposes 

our homebuilding segment is exposed to interest rate risk as it relates to its debt obligations in september 2012 we issued 600000 of senior notes the senior notes mature on september 15 2022 and bear interest at 395 payable semiannually in arrears on march 15 and september 15 changes to interest rates generally affect the fair value of fixedrate debt instruments but not earnings or cash flows we generally have no obligation to prepay the senior notes prior to maturity and therefore interest rate fluctuations should not have a significant impact on our fixedrate debt 

 

our mortgage banking segment is exposed to interest rate risk as it relates to its lending activities the mortgage banking segment originates mortgage loans which are sold through either optional or mandatory forward delivery contracts into the secondary markets all of the mortgage banking segment’s loan portfolio is held for sale and subject to forward sale commitments nvrm also sells all of its mortgages held for sale on a servicing released basis 

nvrm has available a mortgage repurchase agreement which provides for loan repurchases up to 25000 subject to certain sub limits the repurchase agreement is used to fund nvrm’s mortgage origination activities advances under the repurchase agreement carry a pricing rate based on the libor rate plus the libor margin as determined under the repurchase agreement provided that the pricing rate shall not be less than 2825 at december 31 2014 there was no debt outstanding under the repurchase agreement 

the following table represents the contractual balances of our onbalance sheet financial instruments at the expected maturity dates as well as the fair values of those onbalance sheet financial instruments at december 31 2014 the table does not include the debt of our consolidated joint venture as it is nonrecourse to us the expected maturity categories take into consideration the actual and anticipated amortization of principal and do not take into consideration the reinvestment of cash or the refinancing of existing indebtedness because we sell all of the mortgage loans we originate into the secondary markets we have made the assumption that the portfolio of mortgage loans held for sale will mature in the first year consequently advances outstanding under the repurchase agreement would also be assumed to mature in the first year

 item 1 business tableend general 

nvr inc “nvr” a virginia corporation was formed in 1980 as nvhomes inc our primary business is the construction and sale of singlefamily detached homes townhomes and condominium buildings all of which are primarily constructed on a presold basis to more fully serve customers of our homebuilding operations we also operate a mortgage banking and title services business we conduct our homebuilding activities directly our mortgage banking operations are operated primarily through a wholly owned subsidiary nvr mortgage finance inc “nvrm” unless the context otherwise requires references to “nvr” “we” “us” or “our” include nvr and its consolidated subsidiaries 

we are one of the largest homebuilders in the united states we operate in multiple locations in fourteen states and washington dc primarily in the eastern part of the united states during 2013 approximately 25 and 12 of our home settlements occurred in the washington dc and baltimore md metropolitan areas respectively which accounted for approximately 31 and 15 respectively of our 2013 homebuilding revenues our homebuilding operations include the construction and sale of singlefamily detached homes townhomes and condominium buildings under four trade names ryan homes nvhomes fox ridge homes and heartland homes the ryan homes and fox ridge homes products are marketed primarily to firsttime and firsttime moveup buyers ryan homes operates in twentyseven metropolitan areas located in maryland virginia washington dc west virginia pennsylvania new york north carolina south carolina florida ohio new jersey delaware indiana illinois and tennessee fox ridge homes operates in the nashville tn metropolitan area the nvhomes and heartland homes products are marketed primarily to moveup and upscale buyers nvhomes operates in delaware and the washington dc baltimore md philadelphia pa and raleigh nc metropolitan areas heartland homes operates in the pittsburgh pa metropolitan area in 2013 our average price of a settled unit was approximately 349100 

historically we generally have not engaged in land development see discussion below on our limited land development activities instead we typically acquire finished building lots at market prices from various development entities under fixed price purchase agreements “purchase agreements” that require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the purchase agreement the deposits required under the purchase agreements are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percentage typically ranging up to 10 of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots 

we believe that our lot acquisition strategy avoids the financial requirements and risks associated with direct land ownership and land development we may at our option choose for any reason and at any time not to perform under these purchase agreements by delivering notice of our intent not to acquire the finished lots under contract our sole legal obligation and economic loss for failure to perform under these purchase agreements is limited to the amount of the deposit pursuant to the liquidated damage provision contained within the purchase agreements we do not have any financial guarantees or completion obligations and we typically do not guarantee lot purchases on a specific performance basis under these purchase agreements none of the creditors of any of the development entities with which we have entered these purchase agreements have recourse to our general credit we generally seek to maintain control over a supply of lots believed to be suitable to meet our fiveyear business plan 

our continued success is contingent upon our ability to control an adequate supply of finished lots on which to build and on our developers’ ability to deliver finished lots to meet the sales demands of our customers however during the past several years the impact of economic conditions on the homebuilding industry has negatively impacted our developers’ ability to obtain acquisition and development financing and to raise equity investments to finance land development activity as a result of the changing environment in certain specific strategic circumstances we deviate from our historical lot acquisition strategy and engage in joint venture arrangements with land developers or directly acquire raw ground already zoned for its intended use for 

 

development once we acquire control of any raw ground we determine whether to sell the raw parcel to a developer and enter into a fixed price purchase agreement with the developer to purchase the finished lots or whether to hire a developer to develop the land on our behalf while joint venture arrangements and direct land development activity are not our preferred method of acquiring finished building lots we may enter into additional transactions in the future on a limited basis where there exists a compelling strategic or prudent financial reason to do so we expect however to continue to acquire substantially all of our finished lot inventory using fixed price purchase agreements with forfeitable deposits 

as of december 31 2013 we controlled approximately 58100 lots under purchase agreements with deposits in cash and letters of credit totaling approximately 2966 million and 25 million respectively included in the number of controlled lots are approximately 9200 lots for which we have recorded a contract land deposit impairment reserve of approximately 598 million as of december 31 2013 in addition we had an aggregate investment totaling approximately 927 million in four separate joint venture limited liability corporations “jvs” expected to produce approximately 9300 lots of the lots controlled by the jvs approximately 3400 were not under contract with us at december 31 2013 further as of december 31 2013 we directly owned five separate raw parcels of land zoned for their intended use with a current cost basis including development costs of approximately 413 million that we intend to develop into approximately 650 finished lots for use in our homebuilding operations of the total finished lots expected to be developed 125 lots are under contract to be sold to an unrelated party under lot purchase agreements see notes 3 4 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information regarding fixed price purchase agreements jvs and land under development respectively 

in addition to building and selling homes we provide a number of mortgagerelated services through our mortgage banking operations through operations in each of our homebuilding markets nvrm originates mortgage loans almost exclusively for our homebuyers nvrm generates revenues primarily from origination fees gains on sales of loans and title fees nvrm sells all of the mortgage loans it closes into the secondary markets on a servicing released basis 

segment information for our homebuilding and mortgage banking businesses is included in note 2 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

current business environment 

during 2013 sales trends in the first six months were stronger than the last six months of the year during the first half of 2013 the homebuilding market continued to experience the favorable sales and pricing trends which began in 2012 driven by historically low mortgage interest rates and rising costs in the rental market which contributed to higher levels of housing affordability sales trends in the second half of 2013 were negatively impacted by increasing mortgage interest rates rising home prices and buyer uncertainty for additional information and analysis of recent trends in our operations and financial condition see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 of this form 10k 

homebuilding 

products 

we offer singlefamily detached homes townhomes and condominium buildings with many different basic home designs these home designs have a variety of elevations and numerous other options our homes combine traditional transitional cottage or urban exterior designs with contemporary interior designs and amenities generally include two to four bedrooms and range from approximately 800 to 7300 square feet during 2013 the prices at which we settled homes ranged from approximately 120000 to 21 million and averaged approximately 349100 during 2012 our average price was approximately 317100 

 

markets 

our four reportable homebuilding segments operate in the following geographic regions 

 

 backlog 

backlog totaled 4945 units and approximately 18 billion at december 31 2013 compared to backlog of 4979 units and approximately 17 billion at december 31 2012 backlog which represents homes sold but not yet settled with the customer may be impacted by customer cancellations for various reasons that are beyond our control such as the customer’s failure to obtain mortgage financing inability to sell an existing home job loss or a variety of other reasons in any period a portion of the cancellations that we experience are related to new sales that occurred during the same period and a portion are related to sales that occurred in prior periods and therefore appeared in the opening backlog for the current period expressed as the total of all cancellations during the period as a percentage of gross sales during the period our cancellation rate was approximately 15 in both 2013 and 2012 and 14 in 2011 during each of 2013 2012 and 2011 approximately 6 of a quarter’s opening backlog balance cancelled during the fiscal quarter we can provide no assurance that our historical cancellation rates are indicative of the actual cancellation rate that may occur in future periods other than those units that are cancelled we expect to settle substantially all of our december 31 2013 backlog during 2014 see “risk factors” in item 1a and “seasonality” in item 7 of this form 10k 

further discussion of settlements new orders and backlog activity by homebuilding reportable segment for each of the last three years can be found in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 of this form 10k 

construction 

we utilize independent subcontractors under fixed price contracts to perform construction work on our homes we use several independent subcontractors in our various markets and we are not dependent on any single subcontractor or on a small number of subcontractors 

sales and marketing 

our preferred marketing method is for customers to visit a furnished model home featuring many builtin options and a landscaped lot the garages of these model homes are usually converted into temporary sales centers where alternative facades and floor plans are displayed and designs for other models are available for review sales representatives are compensated predominantly on a commission basis 

regulation 

we and our subcontractors must comply with various federal state and local zoning building environmental advertising and consumer credit statutes rules and regulations as well as other regulations and requirements in connection with our construction and sales activities all of these regulations have increased the cost to produce and market our products and in some instances have delayed our developers’ ability to deliver finished lots to us counties and cities in which we build homes have at times declared moratoriums on the issuance of building permits and imposed other restrictions in the areas in which sewage treatment facilities and other public facilities do not reach minimum standards in addition our homebuilding operations are regulated in certain areas by restrictive zoning and density requirements that limit the number of homes that can be built within the boundaries of a particular area to date restrictive zoning laws and the imposition of moratoriums have not had a material adverse effect on our construction activities 

 

competition and market factors 

the housing industry is highly competitive we compete with numerous homebuilders of varying size ranging from local to national in scope some of which have greater financial resources than we do we also face competition from the home resale market our homebuilding operations compete primarily on the basis of price location design quality service and reputation historically we have been one of the market leaders in each of the markets where we build homes 

the housing industry is cyclical and is affected by consumer confidence levels prevailing economic conditions and interest rates other factors that affect the housing industry and the demand for new homes include the availability and the cost of land labor and materials changes in consumer preferences demographic trends and the availability of mortgage finance programs see “risk factors” in item 1a of this form 10k 

we are dependent upon building material suppliers for a continuous flow of raw materials whenever possible we utilize standard products available from multiple sources in the past such raw materials have been generally available to us in adequate supply 

mortgage banking 

we provide a number of mortgage related services to our homebuilding customers through our mortgage banking operations our mortgage banking operations also include separate subsidiaries that broker title insurance and perform title searches in connection with mortgage loan closings for which they receive commissions and fees because nvrm originates mortgage loans almost exclusively for our homebuilding customers nvrm is dependent on our homebuilding segment in 2013 nvrm closed approximately 8600 loans with an aggregate principal amount of approximately 25 billion as compared to approximately 8000 loans with an aggregate principal amount of approximately 22 billion in 2012 

nvrm sells all of the mortgage loans it closes to investors in the secondary markets on a servicing released basis typically within 30 days from the loan closing nvrm is an approved sellerservicer for fannie mae “fnma” mortgage loans and an approved sellerissuer of ginnie mae “gnma” freddie mac “fhlmc” department of veterans affairs “va” and federal housing administration “fha” mortgage loans 

regulation 

nvrm is an approved sellerservicer of fnma mortgage loans and an approved sellerissuer of gnma fhlmc va and fha mortgage loans and is subject to all of those agencies’ rules and regulations these rules and regulations restrict certain activities of nvrm nvrm is currently eligible and expects to remain eligible to participate in such programs in addition nvrm is subject to regulation at the state and federal level including regulations issued by the consumer financial protection bureau the “cfpb” with respect to specific origination selling and servicing practices 

competition and market factors 

nvrm’s main competition comes from national regional and local mortgage bankers mortgage brokers credit unions and banks in each of these markets nvrm competes primarily on the basis of customer service variety of products offered interest rates offered prices of ancillary services and relative financing availability and costs 

pipeline 

nvrm’s mortgage loans in process that had not closed at december 31 2013 and 2012 had an aggregate principal balance of approximately 11 billion in each year nvrm’s cancellation rate was approximately 35 

 

36 and 29 in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively we can provide no assurance that our historical loan cancellation rates are indicative of the actual loan cancellation rate that may occur in future periods see “risk factors” in item 1a in this form 10k 

employees 

at december 31 2013 we employed 3944 fulltime persons none of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement and we have never experienced a work stoppage we believe that our employee relations are good

 item 1a risk factors tableend our business is affected by the risks generally incident to the residential construction business including but not limited to 

 

  

  

  

  

 all of these risks are discussed in detail below 

the homebuilding industry experienced a significant downturn over the past several years which could continue to adversely affect our business and our results of operations 

over the past several years the homebuilding industry experienced a significant downturn as a result of low consumer confidence driven by an economic recession high unemployment levels affordability issues and uncertainty as to the stability of home prices as a result we experienced reduced demand for new homes during 2012 we began to see signs of strengthening within the homebuilding industry with increasing sales and stabilization of sales prices in many markets these favorable trends continued into 2013 however the housing market continues to face challenges from a tight mortgage lending environment increasing mortgage interest rates and consumer confidence issues due to sustained high levels of unemployment if the improvements in the homebuilding industry do not continue or the industry suffers another downturn our gross sales may decrease andor we may have higher cancellation rates which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

if the market value of our inventory or controlled lot position declines our profit could decrease and we may incur losses 

inventory risk can be substantial for homebuilders the market value of building lots and housing inventories can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing market conditions in addition inventory carrying costs can be significant and can result in losses in a poorly performing project or market we must in the ordinary course of our business continuously seek and make acquisitions of lots for expansion into new markets as well as for replacement and expansion within our current markets which is generally accomplished by us entering fixed price purchase agreements and paying forfeitable deposits under the purchase agreement to developers for the contractual right to acquire the lots in the event of adverse changes in economic or market conditions we may cease further building activities in communities or restructure existing purchase agreements resulting in forfeiture of some or all of any remaining land contract deposit paid to the developer either action may result in a loss which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

if the underwriting quality of our mortgage originations is found to be deficient our profit could decrease and we may incur losses 

we originate several different loan products to our customers to finance the purchase of their home we sell all of the loans we originate into the secondary mortgage market generally within 30 days from origination all of the loans that we originate are underwritten to the standards and specifications of the ultimate investor insofar as we underwrite our originated loans to those standards we bear no increased concentration of credit risk from the issuance of loans except in certain limited instances where early payment default occurs in the event that a substantial number of the loans that we have originated fall into default and the investors to whom we sold 

 

the loans determine that we did not underwrite the loans in accordance with their requirements we could be required to repurchase the loans from the investor or indemnify the investor for any losses incurred this may result in losses which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

we may be subject to claims on mortgage loans sold to third parties 

our mortgage banking operations may be responsible for losses associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to investors in the event of errors or omissions relating to certain representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements including representations as to underwriting standards the type of collateral the existence of primary mortgage insurance and the validity of certain borrower representations in connection with the loan the resolution of claims related to alleged breaches of these representations and warranties and repurchase claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition cash flows and results of operations and could exceed existing estimates and accruals because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating these matters there can be no assurance that any amounts reserved will be adequate or that any potential inadequacies will not have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

because almost all of our customers require mortgage financing the availability of suitable mortgage financing could impair the affordability of our homes lower demand for our products and limit our ability to fully deliver our backlog 

our business and earnings depend on the ability of our potential customers to obtain mortgages for the purchase of our homes in addition many of our potential customers must sell their existing homes in order to buy a home from us the tightening of credit standards and the availability of suitable mortgage financing could prevent customers from buying our homes and could prevent buyers of our customers’ homes from obtaining mortgages they need to complete that purchase both of which could result in our potential customers’ inability to buy a home from us if our potential customers or the buyers of our customers’ current homes are not able to obtain suitable financing the result could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

if our ability to sell mortgages to investors is impaired we may be required to fund these commitments ourselves or may not be able to originate loans at all 

our mortgage banking business sells all of the loans it originates into the secondary market usually within 30 days from the date of closing and has up to approximately 25 million available in a repurchase agreement to fund mortgage closings in the event that disruptions to the secondary markets tighten or eliminate the available liquidity within the secondary markets for mortgage loans or the underwriting requirements by our secondary market investors continue to become more stringent our ability to sell future mortgages could decline and we could be required among other things to fund our commitments to our buyers with our own financial resources which is limited or require our home buyers to find another source of financing the result of such secondary market disruption could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

interest rate movements inflation and other economic factors can negatively impact our business 

high rates of inflation generally affect the homebuilding industry adversely because of their adverse impact on interest rates high interest rates not only increase the cost of borrowed funds to homebuilders but also have a significant effect on housing demand and on the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective purchasers we are also subject to potential volatility in the price of commodities that impact costs of materials used in our homebuilding business increases in prevailing interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

 

our financial results also are affected by the risks generally incident to our mortgage banking business including interest rate levels the impact of government regulation on mortgage loan originations and servicing and the need to issue forward commitments to fund and sell mortgage loans our homebuilding customers account for almost all of our mortgage banking business the volume of our continuing homebuilding operations therefore affects our mortgage banking business 

our mortgage banking business also is affected by interest rate fluctuations we also may experience marketing losses resulting from daily increases in interest rates to the extent we are unable to match interest rates and amounts on loans we have committed to originate with forward commitments from third parties to purchase such loans increases in interest rates may have a material adverse effect on our mortgage banking revenue profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

our operations may also be adversely affected by other economic factors within our markets such as negative changes in employment levels job growth and consumer confidence and availability of mortgage financing one or all of which could result in reduced demand or price depression from current levels such negative trends could have a material adverse effect on homebuilding operations 

these factors and thus the homebuilding business have at times in the past been cyclical in nature any downturn in the national economy or the local economies of the markets in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations in particular during 2013 approximately 25 and 12 of our home settlements occurred in the washington dc and baltimore md metropolitan areas respectively which accounted for approximately 31 and 15 respectively of our 2013 homebuilding revenues thus we are dependent to a significant extent on the economy and demand for housing in those areas 

our inability to secure and control an adequate inventory of lots could adversely impact our operations 

the results of our homebuilding operations are dependent upon our continuing ability to control an adequate number of homebuilding lots in desirable locations there can be no assurance that an adequate supply of building lots will continue to be available to us on terms similar to those available in the past or that we will not be required to devote a greater amount of capital to controlling building lots than we have historically an insufficient supply of building lots in one or more of our markets an inability of our developers to deliver finished lots in a timely fashion due to their inability to secure financing to fund development activities or for other reasons or our inability to purchase or finance building lots on reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

volatility in the credit and capital markets may impact our ability to access necessary financing 

if we require working capital greater than that provided by our operations we may be required to obtain alternative financing no assurance can be given that additional financing will be available on terms that are favorable or acceptable if we are required to seek financing to fund our working capital requirements volatility in those markets may restrict our flexibility to access financing if we are at any time unsuccessful in obtaining sufficient capital to fund our planned homebuilding expenditures we may experience a substantial delay in the completion of homes then under construction or we may be unable to control or purchase finished building lots any delay could result in cost increases and could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

our mortgage banking operations are dependent in part on the availability cost and other terms of mortgage financing facilities and may be adversely affected by any shortage or increased cost of such financing no assurance can be given that any additional or replacement financing will be available on terms that are favorable or acceptable our mortgage banking operations are also dependent upon the securitization market for mortgagebacked securities and could be materially adversely affected by any fluctuation or downturn in such market 

 

our current indebtedness may impact our future operations 

our existing indebtedness contains restrictive covenants and any future indebtedness may also contain covenants these covenants include or could include restrictions on our ability to create incur assume or guarantee secured debt enter into sale and leaseback transactions and conditions related to mergers andor the sale of assets substantial losses by us or other action or inaction by us or our subsidiaries could result in the violation of one or more of these covenants which could result in decreased liquidity or a default on our current or future indebtedness thereby having a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

government regulations and environmental matters could negatively affect our operations 

we are subject to various local state and federal statutes ordinances rules and regulations concerning zoning building design construction and similar matters including local regulations that impose restrictive zoning and density requirements in order to limit the number of homes that can eventually be built within the boundaries of a particular area these regulations may further increase the cost to produce and market our products in addition we have from time to time been subject to and may also be subject in the future to periodic delays in our homebuilding projects due to building moratoriums in the areas in which we operate or delays in receiving the necessary governmental approvals changes in regulations that restrict homebuilding activities in one or more of our principal markets could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

in addition new housing developments are often subject to various assessments or impact fees for schools parks streets highways and other public improvements the cost of these assessments is subject to substantial change and can cause increases in the construction cost of our homes which in turn could reduce our profitability 

we are also subject to a variety of local state and federal statutes ordinances rules and regulations concerning the protection of health and the environment we are subject to a variety of environmental conditions that can affect our business and our homebuilding projects the particular environmental laws that apply to any given homebuilding site vary greatly according to the location and environmental condition of the site and the present and former uses of the site and adjoining properties environmental laws and conditions may result in delays cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs or prohibit or severely restrict homebuilding activity in certain environmentally sensitive regions or areas thereby adversely affecting our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

in addition the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act enacted on july 21 2010 contains numerous provisions affecting residential mortgages and mortgage lending practices the cfpb issued rules governing multiple issues in january 2013 including “ability to repay” underwriting provisions definition and parameters of “qualified mortgages” and the establishment of certain protections from liability under “ability to repay” provisions for “qualified mortgages” the cfpb’s rulemaking also included limitations on certain fees and loan officer compensation requirements these rules were effective january 2014 the tighter underwriting requirements and fee restrictions under these standards may negatively impact our mortgage loan origination business 

we are an approved sellerservicer of fnma mortgage loans and an approved sellerissuer of gnma fhlmc va and fha mortgage loans and are subject to all of those agencies’ rules and regulations any significant impairment of our eligibility to sellservice these loans could have a material adverse impact on our mortgage operations in addition we are subject to regulation at the state and federal level with respect to specific origination selling and servicing practices including the real estate settlement and protection act adverse changes in governmental regulation may have a negative impact on our mortgage loan origination business 

 

increased regulation of the mortgage industry could harm our future sales and earnings 

the mortgage industry remains under intense scrutiny and continues to face increasing regulation at the federal state and local level potential changes to federal laws and regulations could have the effect of limiting the activities of fnma and fhlmc the entities that provide liquidity to the secondary mortgage market which could lead to increases in mortgage interest rates at the same time recent and proposed changes to the fha’s rules to require increased borrower credit scores increased down payment amounts and limiting the amount of permitted seller concessions lessen the number of buyers able to finance a new home all of these regulatory activities reduce the number of potential buyers who qualify for the financing necessary to purchase our homes which could harm our future sales and earnings 

we face competition in our homebuilding and mortgage banking operations 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive we compete with numerous homebuilders of varying size ranging from local to national in scope some of whom have greater financial resources than we do we face competition 

 

  

  

 our homebuilding operations compete primarily on the basis of price location design quality service and reputation 

the mortgage banking industry is also competitive our main competition comes from national regional and local mortgage bankers credit unions banks and mortgage brokers in each of these markets our mortgage banking operations compete primarily on the basis of customer service variety of products offered interest rates offered prices of ancillary services and relative financing availability and costs 

there can be no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully in our homebuilding or mortgage banking operations an inability to effectively compete may have an adverse impact on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

a shortage of building materials or labor or increases in materials or labor costs may adversely impact our operations 

the homebuilding business has from time to time experienced building material and labor shortages including shortages in insulation drywall certain carpentry work and concrete as well as fluctuating lumber prices and supply in addition strong construction market conditions could restrict the labor force available to our subcontractors and us in one or more of our markets significant increases in costs resulting from these shortages or delays in construction of homes could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

we rely on subcontractors to construct our homes the failure of our subcontractors to properly construct our homes may be costly 

we engage subcontractors to perform the actual construction of our homes despite our quality control efforts we may discover that our subcontractors were engaging in improper construction practices the occurrence of such events could require us to repair the homes in accordance with our standards and as required by law the cost of satisfying our legal obligations in these instances may be significant and we may be unable to recover the cost of repair from subcontractors suppliers and insurers 

 

product liability litigation and warranty claims may adversely impact our operations 

construction defect and home warranty claims are common and can represent a substantial risk for the homebuilding industry the cost of insuring against construction defect and product liability related claims as well as the claims themselves can be high in addition insurance companies limit coverage offered to protect against these claims further restrictions on coverage availability or significant increases in premium costs or claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

we are subject to litigation proceedings that could harm our business if an unfavorable ruling were to occur 

from time to time we may become involved in litigation and other legal proceedings relating to claims arising from our operations in the normal course of business as described in but not limited to part i item 3 “legal proceedings” of this form 10k we are currently subject to certain legal proceedings litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings may occur we cannot assure you that these or other litigation or legal proceedings will not materially affect our ability to conduct our business in the manner that we expect or otherwise adversely affect us should an unfavorable ruling occur 

our failure to maintain the security of our electronic and other confidential information could expose us to liability and materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

privacy security and compliance concerns have continued to increase as technology has evolved as part of our normal business activities we collect and store certain confidential information including personal information of homebuyersborrowers and information about employees vendors and suppliers this information is entitled to protection under a number of federal and state laws we may share some of this information with vendors who assist us with certain aspects of our business particularly our mortgage and title businesses our failure to maintain the security of the data which we are required to protect including via the penetration of our network security and the misappropriation of confidential and personal information could result in business disruption damage to our reputation financial obligations to third parties fines penalties regulatory proceedings and private litigation with potentially large costs and also in deterioration in customers’ confidence in us and other competitive disadvantages and thus could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

weatherrelated and other events beyond our control may adversely impact our operations 

extreme weather or other events such as significant snowfalls hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes forest fires floods terrorist attacks or war may affect our markets our operations and our profitability these events may impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or subcontractors causing us material increases in costs or delays in construction of homes which could have a material adverse effect upon our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend on july 18 2007 former and current employees filed lawsuits against us in the court of common pleas in allegheny county pennsylvania and hamilton county ohio in superior court in durham county north carolina and in the circuit court in montgomery county maryland and on july 19 2007 in the superior court in new jersey alleging that we incorrectly classified our sales and marketing representatives as being exempt from overtime wages these lawsuits are similar in nature to another lawsuit filed on october 29 2004 by another former employee in the united states district court for the western district of new york captioned tracy v nvr inc the lawsuits filed in ohio pennsylvania maryland new jersey and north carolina have been stayed pending further developments in the tracy action 

the complaints described above seek injunctive relief an award of unpaid wages including fringe benefits liquidated damages equal to the overtime wages allegedly due and not paid attorney and other fees and interest and where available multiple damages while the suits were filed as purported class actions none of them have been certified as such on april 29 2013 the western district of new york ruled that the claims asserted in the tracy case were not appropriate for class action treatment and dismissed a number of individuals who had filed consents to join that action from the case the trial on the remaining individual plaintiff’s claims was held in october 2013 on october 23 2013 the jury in that trial ruled in our favor that the plaintiff was an exempt outside salesman 

on may 29 2013 attorneys representing the individuals dismissed from the tracy action filed another lawsuit on behalf of those individuals in the new york supreme court for monroe county captioned anderson v nvr inc we removed the anderson action to the western district of new york on june 18 2013 plaintiffs subsequently filed a motion to stay the anderson action pending final disposition of the tracy action which we opposed we also filed a motion to sever the multitude of individuals participating in the anderson action leaving each plaintiff to pursue his or her claim individually to the extent that they chose to do so 

we believe that our compensation practices in regard to sales and marketing representatives are entirely lawful and in compliance with two letter rulings from the united states department of labor “dol” issued in january 2007 courts that have considered similar claims against other homebuilders have acknowledged the dol’s position that sales and marketing representatives were properly classified as exempt from overtime wages and the only court to have directly addressed the exempt status of such employees concluded that the dol’s position was valid in addition the jury verdict in the tracy v nvr inc matter in october 2013 upheld our classification of the position accordingly we have vigorously defended and intend to continue to vigorously defend these lawsuits in light of the points noted above we have not recorded any associated liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets in conjunction with the anderson v nvr inc case or any other legal challenges to the exempt status of our sales and marketing representatives 

in june 2010 we received a request for information from the united states environmental protection agency “epa” pursuant to section 308 of the clean water act the request sought information about storm water discharge practices in connection with homebuilding projects completed or underway by us in new york and new jersey we cooperated with this request and provided information to the epa we were subsequently 

 

informed by the united states department of justice “doj” that the epa forwarded the information on the matter to the doj and the doj requested that we meet with the government to discuss the status of the case meetings took place in january 2012 and august 2012 with representatives from both the epa and doj it is not yet known what next steps if any the doj will take in the matter we intend to continue cooperating with any future epa andor doj inquiries at this time we cannot predict the outcome of this inquiry nor can we reasonably estimate the potential costs that may be associated with its eventual resolution 

we are also involved in various other litigation arising in the ordinary course of business in the opinion of management and based on advice of legal counsel this litigation is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows legal costs incurred in connection with outstanding litigation are expensed as incurred

overview 

business 

our primary business is the construction and sale of singlefamily detached homes townhomes and condominium buildings all of which are primarily constructed on a presold basis to fully serve customers of our homebuilding operations we also operate a mortgage banking and title services business we primarily conduct our operations in mature markets additionally we generally grow our business through market share gains in our existing markets and by expanding into markets contiguous to our current active markets our four homebuilding reportable segments consist of the following regions 

 

  

our lot acquisition strategy is predicated upon avoiding the financial requirements and risks associated with direct land ownership and development historically we generally have not engaged in land development to obtain finished lots for use in our homebuilding operations instead we have acquired finished lots at market prices from various third party land developers pursuant to fixed price purchase agreements these purchase agreements require deposits typically ranging up to 10 of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots in the form of cash or letters of credit that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the purchase agreement this strategy has allowed us to maximize inventory turnover which we believe enables us to minimize market risk and to operate with less capital thereby enhancing rates of return on equity and total capital 

our continued success is contingent upon our ability to control an adequate supply of finished lots on which to build and on our developers’ ability to deliver finished lots to meet the sales demands of our customers however during the past several years the impact of economic conditions on the homebuilding industry has negatively impacted our developers’ ability to obtain acquisition and development financing and to raise equity investments to finance land development activity as a result of the changing environment in certain specific strategic circumstances we deviate from our historical lot acquisition strategy and engage in joint venture arrangements with land developers or directly acquire raw ground already zoned for its intended use for development once we acquire control of any raw ground we determine whether to sell the raw parcel to a developer and enter into a fixed price purchase agreement with the developer to purchase the finished lots or whether we will hire a developer to develop the land on our behalf while joint venture arrangements and direct land development activity are not our preferred method of acquiring finished building lots we may enter into additional transactions in the future on a limited basis where there exists a compelling strategic or prudent financial reason to do so we expect however to continue to acquire substantially all of our finished lot inventory using fixed price purchase agreements with forfeitable deposits 

as of december 31 2013 we controlled approximately 58100 lots under purchase agreements with deposits in cash and letters of credit totaling approximately 296600 and 2500 respectively in addition we controlled approximately 6000 lots through joint venture limited liability corporations with an aggregate investment of approximately 92700 further as of december 31 2013 we had approximately 41300 in land under development that once fully developed will result in approximately 650 lots for use in our homebuilding operations of the total finished lots expected to be developed 125 lots are under contract to be sold to an unrelated party under lot purchase agreements included in the number of controlled lots are approximately 9200 lots for which we have recorded a contract land deposit impairment reserve of approximately 59800 as of december 31 2013 see notes 3 4 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information regarding fixed price purchase agreements joint ventures and land under development respectively 

in addition to constructing homes primarily on a presold basis and utilizing what we believe is a conservative lot acquisition strategy we focus on obtaining and maintaining a leading market position in each market we serve this strategy allows us to gain valuable efficiencies and competitive advantages in our markets which we believe contributes to minimizing the adverse effects of regional economic cycles and provides growth opportunities within these markets 

current business environment and key financial results 

during 2013 sales trends in the first six months were stronger than the last six months of the year during the first half of 2013 the homebuilding market continued to experience the favorable sales and pricing trends which began in 2012 driven by historically low mortgage interest rates and rising costs in the rental market which contributed to higher levels of housing affordability sales trends in the second half of 2013 were negatively impacted by increasing mortgage interest rates higher home prices and buyer uncertainty the housing market also continues to face challenges from tight mortgage underwriting standards while we have benefited from generally improved market conditions we continue to face gross margin pressure due to increasing land and construction costs 

 

our consolidated revenues for the year ended december 31 2013 totaled 4211267 an increase of 32 from 3184650 in 2012 net income for 2013 increased 48 from the prior year to 266477 diluted earnings per share in 2013 was 5481 an increase of 56 from the prior year new orders for 2013 increased 8 from the prior year while our average new order sales price of 3604 in 2013 was 10 higher than the prior year 

we believe that the continuation of the housing market recovery which began in 2012 is dependent upon a sustained overall economic recovery driven by continued improvement in unemployment and consumer confidence levels due to the strength of our balance sheet we believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities that may arise from future economic and homebuilding market volatility 

homebuilding operations 

the following table summarizes the results of our consolidated homebuilding operations and certain operating activity for each of the last three years 

 

 consolidated homebuilding revenues 

homebuilding revenues for 2013 increased 32 from 2012 as a result of a 20 increase in the number of homes settled and a 10 increase in the average settlement price year over year the increase in the number of homes settled was primarily attributable to a 35 higher beginning backlog unit balance entering 2013 as compared to 2012 offset partially by a lower backlog turnover rate in 2013 compared to 2012 average settlement prices in the current year were favorably impacted primarily by a 10 higher average price of homes in backlog entering 2013 compared to the average price of homes in backlog entering 2012 and a 10 higher average sales price of new orders for the first six months of 2013 compared to 2012 the higher beginning backlog balance and average sales prices were driven by the favorable market conditions discussed in the overview section above 

homebuilding revenues for 2012 increased 20 from 2011 as a result of a 16 increase in the number of homes settled and a 3 increase in the average settlement price year over year the increase in the number of homes settled was attributable to an 18 increase in new orders during the first half of 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 coupled with a 26 higher beginning backlog unit balance entering 2012 as compared to 2011 these increases were offset partially by a lower backlog turnover rate in 2012 compared to 2011 average settlement prices in 2012 were favorably impacted by a 7 higher average sales price of new orders during the first six months of 2012 as compared to the same period in 2011 offset partially by a 4 lower average price of homes in backlog entering 2012 compared to the average price of homes in backlog entering 2011 

 

consolidated homebuilding new orders 

new orders and the average sales price of new orders in 2013 increased 8 and 10 respectively when compared to 2012 new orders and the average sales price were higher year over year in each of our market segments the increase in new orders was driven by a 12 increase in the number of active communities year over year offset partially by a lower absorption rate in 2013 in addition our december 2012 acquisition of heartland homes added 355 new orders in 2013 the increase in active communities and pricing in 2013 was attributable to the favorable market conditions through the first half of 2013 as discussed in the overview section above 

new orders and the average sales price of new orders in 2012 increased 18 and 8 respectively when compared to 2011 new orders and the average sales price were higher year over year in each of our market segments the increase in new orders was driven by a 5 increase in the number of active communities year over year and by improved absorption rates in many of our markets the increase in new orders as well as in the average new order sales price was attributable to improved market conditions in 2012 

consolidated homebuilding gross profit 

gross profit margins in 2013 decreased to 172 from 175 in 2012 gross profit margins were negatively impacted in 2013 by two warranty accrual charges the first charge of approximately 15600 was recognized in the second quarter of 2013 related to remediation of primarily water infiltration issues in a single completed community the water infiltration issues were the result of a design issue with several products developed for and built exclusively in that one community the second charge of approximately 16000 was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2013 to increase the warranty accrual for a nonrecurring service issue unrelated to the second quarter service issue excluding these charges gross profit margin was 179 an increase of 46 basis points from the prior year gross profit margin was favorably impacted by higher settlement volume in the current year allowing us to better leverage our operating costs partially offset by higher construction costs including lumber and certain other commodity costs year over year we expect to continue to experience gross profit margin pressure over the next several quarters due to cost and pricing pressures 

gross profit margins in 2012 increased to 175 from 171 in 2011 margins were favorably impacted in 2012 by a 2000 recovery of contract land deposits previously determined to be uncollectible compared to an 11200 contract land deposit impairment charge in 2011 in addition increased settlement volume and higher average settlement prices in 2012 allowed us to better leverage certain operating costs however this favorable impact was offset by higher construction lumber and certain other commodity costs year over year

sga expenses in 2013 increased approximately 11800 or 4 compared to 2012 but as a percentage of revenue decreased to 76 in 2013 from 97 in 2012 the increase in sga expense was attributable to increases of approximately 20300 in personnel costs in 2013 due to an increase in headcount year over year in addition sales and marketing costs were approximately 14400 higher in 2013 due to the increase in the number of active communities these cost increases were partially offset by an approximate 28700 reduction in equitybased compensation in 2013 compared to 2012 equitybased compensation was favorably impacted as a result of the restricted share units “rsus” issued in 2010 becoming fully vested as of december 31 2012 and the reversal of approximately 7100 in equitybased compensation expense previously recorded to sga expense as we adjusted our stock option forfeiture rates based on our actual forfeiture experience these reductions were offset partially by equitybased compensation expense incurred in 2013 related to rsus issued in may 2013 the decrease in sga costs as a percentage of revenue was driven by the 32 increase in revenue in 2013 allowing us to better leverage our overhead costs 

sga expenses in 2012 increased approximately 36900 or 14 compared to 2011 but as a percentage of revenue decreased to 97 in 2012 from 101 in the prior year the increase in sga expense was attributable to an increase of approximately 19700 in management incentive costs driven by improved 

 

financial results in 2012 in addition personnel costs and sales and marketing costs were approximately 9400 and 6400 higher respectively in 2012 due primarily to the 5 increase in the number of active communities compared to 2011 sga expenses decreased as a percentage of revenue due to the 20 increase in revenues in 2012 compared to 2011 

consolidated homebuilding backlog 

backlog units decreased approximately 1 to 4945 as of december 31 2013 compared to 4979 as of december 31 2012 while backlog dollars increased approximately 7 to 1845600 from 1723914 as of december 31 2013 and december 31 2012 respectively backlog dollars were higher primarily due to a 10 increase in the average price of new orders for the sixmonth period ended december 31 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 

backlog which represents homes sold but not yet settled with the customer may be impacted by customer cancellations for various reasons that are beyond our control such as failure to obtain mortgage financing inability to sell an existing home job loss or a variety of other reasons in any period a portion of the cancellations that we experience are related to new sales that occurred during the same period and a portion are related to sales that occurred in prior periods and therefore appeared in the opening backlog for the current period expressed as the total of all cancellations during the period as a percentage of gross sales during the period our cancellation rate was approximately 15 in both 2013 and 2012 and 14 in 2011 during each of 2013 2012 and 2011 approximately 6 of a reporting quarter’s opening backlog cancelled during the fiscal quarter we can provide no assurance that our historical cancellation rates are indicative of the actual cancellation rate that may occur in future periods other than those units that are cancelled we expect to settle substantially all of our december 31 2013 backlog during 2014 see “risk factors” in item 1a of this report 

the backlog turnover rate is impacted by various factors including but not limited to changes in new order activity internal production capacity external subcontractor capacity and other external factors over which we do not exercise control 

backlog units and dollars increased approximately 35 to 4979 and 49 to 1723914 respectively as of december 31 2012 compared to 3676 and 1160879 as of december 31 2011 the increase in backlog units was primarily attributable to new orders being approximately 800 units higher for the six month period ended december 31 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 coupled with a slower backlog turnover rate in 2012 in addition our december 31 2012 acquisition of heartland homes added approximately 200 units and 81600 to the 2012 yearend backlog the increase in backlog dollars is attributable to the increase in units and to a 9 higher average sales price for new orders for the six month period ended december 31 2012 

 

reportable homebuilding segments 

homebuilding profit before tax includes all revenues and income generated from the sale of homes less the cost of homes sold sga expenses and a corporate capital allocation charge the corporate capital allocation charge eliminates in consolidation is based on the segment’s average net assets employed and is charged using a consistent methodology in the years presented the corporate capital allocation charged to the operating segment allows the chief operating decision maker to determine whether the operating segment’s results are providing the desired rate of return after covering our cost of capital we record charges on contract land deposits when we determine that it is probable that recovery of the deposit is impaired for segment reporting purposes impairments on contract land deposits are generally charged to the operating segment upon the determination to terminate a finished lot purchase agreement with the developer or to restructure a lot purchase agreement resulting in the forfeiture of the deposit we evaluate our entire net contract land deposit portfolio for impairment each quarter for additional information regarding our contract land deposit impairment analysis see the critical accounting policies section within this management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for presentation purposes below the contract land deposit reserve at december 31 2013 and 2012 has been allocated to the reportable segments to show contract land deposits on a net basis the net contract land deposit balances below also includes approximately 2500 and 3300 at december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively of letters of credit issued as deposits in lieu of cash the following tables summarize certain homebuilding operating activity by reportable segment for each of the last three years

mid atlantic 

2013 versus 2012 

the mid atlantic segment had an approximate 87300 or 46 increase in segment profit in 2013 compared to 2012 the increase in segment profit was driven by the increase of approximately 561500 or 30 in revenues year over year due to a 20 increase in the number of units settled and a 9 increase in the average settlement price the increase in units settled was attributable to a 36 higher backlog unit balance entering 2013 compared to the backlog unit balance entering 2012 offset partially by a lower backlog turnover rate year over year settlements were also favorably impacted by a 14 increase in new orders for the first six months of 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 average settlement prices were higher due to a 6 higher average price of homes in backlog entering 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 and a 10 higher average sales price for new orders during the first six months of 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 gross profit margin in the current year was impacted by a charge of approximately 15600 or 64 basis points of revenue as discussed above in the consolidated homebuilding gross profit section to establish an accrual related to remediation of primarily water infiltration issues in a single completed community excluding this charge gross profit margin increased 119 basis points to 196 in the current year due to increased settlement volume which allowed us to better leverage certain operating costs 

segment new orders and the average sales price increased 5 and 9 respectively in 2013 from 2012 new orders increased due to an 11 increase in the number of active communities partially offset by a lower absorption rate the increase in the average sales price was attributable to a shift to higher priced communities in certain markets and favorable market conditions through the first half of 2013 which allowed us to increase prices in several markets within the mid atlantic segment 

2012 versus 2011 

the mid atlantic segment had an approximate 40700 or 27 increase in segment profit in 2012 compared to 2011 the increase in segment profit was driven by the increase of approximately 295100 or 19 in revenues year over year due primarily to a 19 increase in the number of units settled the increase in units settled was attributable to a 26 increase in new orders during the first half of 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 coupled with a 24 higher backlog unit balance entering 2012 compared to the backlog unit balance entering 2011 these increases were partially offset by a slower backlog turnover rate in 2012 compared to 2011 the mid atlantic segment’s gross profit margin percentage increased to 184 in 2012 from 181 in 2011 primarily due to a 40 basis point decrease in contract land deposit impairment charges year over year the favorable impact of the increased settlement volume in 2012 which allowed us to better leverage certain operating costs was offset by higher construction lumber and certain other commodity costs year over year 

segment new orders and the average sales price increased 25 and 5 respectively in 2012 compared to 2011 new orders and the average sales price were higher in each of our markets within the mid atlantic segment new orders increased due to a 6 increase in the number of active communities and higher sales absorption driven by improved market conditions in 2012 

north east 

2013 versus 2012 

the north east segment had an approximate 7200 or 34 decrease in segment profit in 2013 compared to 2012 the decrease was attributable to a charge in the fourth quarter of 2013 to increase the warranty accrual for the nonrecurring service issue discussed above in the consolidated homebuilding gross profit section excluding this charge to the segment of approximately 12700 segment profit increased approximately 5500 or 25 compared to 2012 revenues in the segment increased approximately 54000 or 19 year over year due to a 14 increase in the number of units settled coupled with a 5 increase in the 

 

average settlement price the increase in units settled was attributable to a 15 higher backlog unit balance entering 2013 as compared to the backlog unit balance entering 2012 in addition to a 15 increase in new orders for the first six months of 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 the average settlement price increased year over year due to a 9 higher average price of homes in backlog entering 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 and a 1 higher average sales price for new orders during the first six months of 2013 compared to 2012 the north east segment’s gross profit margin percentage was down 356 basis points year over year excluding the warranty accrual charge discussed above of approximately 12700 or 382 basis points of revenue gross profit margin for the segment was 176 an increase of 27 basis points compared to 2012 

segment new orders and the average sales price increased approximately 14 and 3 respectively in 2013 from 2012 new orders were favorably impacted by higher sales absorption levels attributable to favorable market conditions through the first half of 2013 and a decrease in the cancellation rate year over year 

2012 versus 2011 

the north east segment had an approximate 8100 or 60 increase in segment profit in 2012 compared to 2011 the increase in segment profit was primarily driven by an increase of approximately 57600 or 26 in revenues year over year due to a 22 increase in the number of units settled and a 3 increase in the average settlement price the increase in units settled was attributable to a 62 higher backlog unit balance entering 2012 compared to the backlog unit balance entering 2011 coupled with an 8 increase in new orders during the first half of 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 these increases were partially offset by a slower backlog turnover rate in 2012 compared to 2011 the increase in the average settlement price in 2012 was primarily attributable to a 9 increase in the average new order sales price for the first six months of 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 due to a product mix shift from our attached products to our detached products which generally sell at higher price points this increase was partially offset by a 4 lower average price of homes in backlog entering 2012 compared to the average price of homes in backlog entering 2011 the north east segment’s gross profit margin percentage increased approximately 50 basis points in 2012 compared to 2011 segment profit and gross profit margins were favorably impacted by the previously mentioned higher average settlement price year over year in addition gross profit margins were favorably impacted by the higher settlement volumes allowing us to better leverage certain operating costs in 2012 these favorable variances were partially offset by higher construction lumber and certain other commodity costs year over year 

segment new orders and the average sales price each increased approximately 8 in 2012 compared to 2011 new orders were favorably impacted by the improved market conditions in 2012 and by a 12 increase in the number of active communities in 2012 compared to 2011 this favorable impact was partially offset by an increase in the cancellation rate in the north east segment to 168 in 2012 from 131 in the prior year the increase in the average sales price is attributable to a product mix shift away from our attached products to our detached products which generally sell at higher price points 

mid east 

2013 versus 2012 

the mid east segment had an approximate 15700 or 39 increase in segment profit in 2013 compared to 2012 the increase in segment profit was driven by an increase in revenues of approximately 277800 or 44 year over year due to a 22 increase in the number of units settled and an 18 increase in the average settlement price the increase in settlements was primarily attributable to a 43 higher backlog unit balance entering 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 coupled with a 21 increase in new orders during the first half of 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 the higher backlog balance entering 2013 was in part attributable to our heartland homes acquisition which added approximately 200 units and 81600 to backlog at december 31 2012 average settlement prices were higher due to a 21 higher average price of homes in backlog entering 2013 compared to 2012 resulting from a shift in mix to higher priced communities as well as to the higher average price of homes in the backlog acquired from heartland homes in addition the average settlement price was favorably impacted by a 17 increase in the average new order sales price during the first 

 

half of 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 gross profit margin decreased to 157 in 2013 from 164 in 2012 due to the lower average gross profit margin associated with the heartland homes backlog acquired and higher construction costs including lumber and certain other commodity costs these cost increases were partially offset by the favorable impact of increased settlement volume which allowed us to better leverage certain operating costs 

segment new orders and the average sales price for new orders increased 11 and 17 respectively during 2013 compared to 2012 new orders increased due to 355 new orders from heartland homes the increase in the average new order sales price was attributable to a shift in mix to higher priced communities in certain markets including higher average sales prices associated with the heartland homes new orders coupled with favorable market conditions through the first half of 2013 which allowed us to increase prices in certain markets 

2012 versus 2011 

the mid east segment had an approximate 12700 or 47 increase in segment profit in 2012 compared to 2011 due primarily to an increase in revenues of approximately 81000 or 15 year over year revenues increased due to a 6 increase in the number of units settled and a 9 increase in the average price of settlements in 2012 compared to 2011 the increase in units settled was attributable to an 11 higher backlog unit balance entering 2012 compared to the backlog unit balance entering 2011 coupled with a 7 increase in new orders during the first half of 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 these increases were partially offset by a slower backlog turnover rate in 2012 compared to 2011 average settlement prices were favorably impacted by an 11 increase in the average new order sales price for the first six months of 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 due to a shift in mix to higher priced communities in certain markets gross profit margins increased approximately 80 basis points in 2012 from 2011 primarily as a result of the increase in the average settlement price as well as from the increase in the number of settlements allowing us to better leverage certain operating costs in 2012 these favorable variances were partially offset by higher construction lumber and certain other commodity costs year over year 

segment new orders and the average sales price for new orders increased 9 and 11 respectively in 2012 compared to 2011 new orders were favorably impacted by the improved market conditions in 2012 which contributed in part to higher sales absorption levels the increase in the average sales price was attributable to a shift in mix to higher priced communities in certain markets 

the increases to the mid east segment’s 2012 backlog sold and unsold inventory lots controlled and contract land deposit balances were all in part driven by the heartland homes acquisition on december 31 2012 the acquisition did not impact sales or settlement results in 2012 

south east 

2013 versus 2012 

the south east segment had an approximate 14300 or 69 increase in segment profit in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to an increase in revenues of approximately 120000 or 36 year over year segment revenues were higher due to a 23 increase in the number of units settled and a 10 increase in the average settlement price the increase in settlements was attributable to a 37 higher backlog unit balance entering 2013 compared to 2012 and a 29 increase in new orders for the first six months of 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 these increases were partially offset by a lower backlog turnover rate year over year the average settlement price was favorably impacted by a 12 higher average price of homes in backlog entering 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 as well as by a 9 increase in the average sales price of homes in the first six months of 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 the south east segment’s gross profit margin increased 32 basis points in 2013 from 2012 primarily due to the favorable impact of increased settlement volume which allowed us to better leverage certain operating costs 

 

segment new orders and the average sales price for new orders each increased approximately 9 in 2013 from 2012 new orders increased due to a 7 increase in the number of active communities and higher sales absorption levels driven by favorable market conditions through the first half of 2013 the increase in the average sales price for new orders was attributable to a shift in mix of new orders to higher priced communities in certain markets 

2012 versus 2011 

the south east segment had an approximate 6500 or 46 increase in segment profit in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to an increase in revenues of approximately 76400 or 30 year over year segment revenues were higher primarily due to a 21 increase in the number of homes settled and a 7 increase in the average settlement price year over year the increase in settlements was attributable to a 45 higher backlog unit balance entering 2012 compared to 2011 coupled with a 23 increase in new orders during the first half of 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 these increases were partially offset by a slower backlog turnover rate in 2012 compared to 2011 average settlement prices were favorably impacted by a 12 increase in the average new order sales price for the first six months of 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 attributable to a shift in mix to higher priced markets and higher priced communities in certain markets the south east segment’s gross profit margins in 2012 increased approximately 40 basis points from 2011 primarily due to the higher average settlement prices and improved operating leverage attributable to higher settlement volume year over year these favorable variances were partially offset by higher construction lumber and certain other commodity costs year over year 

segment new orders and the average sales price for new orders increased approximately 21 and 12 respectively in 2012 compared to 2011 new orders were favorably impacted in 2012 by a 12 increase in the number of active communities and by the improved market conditions in 2012 which contributed in part to higher sales absorption levels the increase in the average sales price for new orders was attributable to a shift in mix to higher priced markets and higher priced communities in certain markets 

homebuilding segment reconciliations to consolidated homebuilding operations 

in addition to the corporate capital allocation and contract land deposit impairments discussed above the other reconciling items between homebuilding segment profit and homebuilding consolidated profit before tax include unallocated corporate overhead which includes all management incentive compensation equitybased compensation expense consolidation adjustments and external corporate interest expense our overhead functions such as accounting treasury and human resources are centrally performed and the costs are not allocated to our operating segments consolidation adjustments consist of such items to convert the reportable segments’ results which are predominantly maintained on a cash basis to a full accrual basis for external financial statement presentation purposes and are not allocated to our operating segments likewise equitybased compensation expense is not charged to the operating segments external corporate interest expense is primarily comprised of interest charges on our 395 senior notes due 2022 the “senior notes” and is not charged to the operating segments because the charges are included in the corporate capital allocation discussed above 

 

  

    

  

   

mortgage banking segment 

we conduct our mortgage banking activity through nvrm a wholly owned subsidiary nvrm focuses almost exclusively on serving the homebuilding segment’s customer base following is a table of financial and statistical data for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 

 

 2013 versus 2012 

loan closing volume for the year ended december 31 2013 increased 15 from 2012 the increase was primarily attributable to a 7 increase in the number of units closed and an 8 increase in the average loan amount year over year the increase in the number of units closed and the increase in the average loan amount are primarily attributable to the aforementioned increase in the homebuilding segment’s number of units settled and the increase in the average settlement prices in 2013 as compared to 2012 partially offset by a decrease in the number of loans closed by nvrm for our homebuyers who obtain a mortgage to purchase a home “capture rate” the capture rate decreased from 87 in 2012 to 81 in 2013 primarily due to a more competitive market for mortgage loans as other lenders’ refinancing activity slowed 

segment profit for the year ended december 31 2013 increased approximately 3900 from 2012 the increase in segment profit was primarily attributable to an approximate 13400 increase in mortgage banking fees partially offset by an approximate 10000 increase in general and administrative expenses the increase in mortgage banking fees was primarily attributable to the aforementioned 15 increase in closed loan volume and an increase in secondary marketing fees the increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to an increase in compensation costs as a result of a 43 increase in headcount compared to 2012 

 

2012 versus 2011 

loan closing volume for the year ended december 31 2012 increased 18 from 2011 the 2012 increase was primarily attributable to a 14 increase in the number of units closed and a 3 increase in the average loan amount year over year the increase in the number of units closed and the increase in the average loan amount are primarily attributable to the aforementioned increase in the homebuilding segment’s number of units settled and the increase in the average settlement prices in 2012 as compared to 2011 

segment profit for the year ended december 31 2012 increased approximately 12000 from 2011 the increase in segment profit was primarily attributable to an approximate 15500 increase in mortgage banking fees partially offset by an approximate 2700 increase in general and administrative expenses the increase in mortgage banking fees was partially attributable to the aforementioned 18 increase in closed loan volume and an increase in secondary marketing fees the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to an increase in compensation costs as a result of a 33 increase in headcount compared to 2011 the increase in compensation costs was partially offset by an approximate 3700 decrease in the provision for loan loss as compared to 2011 

mortgage banking – other 

we sell all of the loans we originate into the secondary mortgage market insofar as we underwrite our originated loans to the standards and specifications of the ultimate investor we have no further financial obligations from the issuance of loans except in certain limited instances where early payment default occurs those underwriting standards are typically equal to or more stringent than the underwriting standards required by fnma va and fha because we sell all of our loans and do not service them there is often a substantial delay between the time that a loan goes into default and the time that the investor requests us to reimburse them for losses incurred because of the default we believe that all of the loans that we originate are underwritten to the standards and specifications of the ultimate investor to whom we sell our originated loans we employ a quality control department to ensure that our underwriting controls are effective and further assess the underwriting function as part of our assessment of internal controls over financial reporting 

nvrm maintains an allowance for losses on mortgage loans originated that reflects our judgment of the present loss exposure from the loans that we have originated and sold the allowance is calculated based on an analysis of historical experience and exposure at december 31 2013 we had an allowance for loan losses of approximately 8200 although we consider the allowance for loan losses reflected on the december 31 2013 balance sheet to be adequate there can be no assurance that this allowance will prove to be adequate to cover losses on loans previously originated 

nvrm is dependent on our homebuilding segment’s customers for business if new orders and sales prices of the homebuilding segment decline nvrm’s operations will also be adversely affected in addition the mortgage segment’s operating results may be adversely affected in future periods due to the continued tightening and volatility of the credit markets changes in investor funding times as well as increased regulation of mortgage lending practices the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act enacted on july 21 2010 contains numerous provisions affecting residential mortgages and mortgage lending practices the cfpb issued rules in january 2013 including “ability to repay” underwriting provisions definition and parameters of “qualified mortgages” and the establishment of certain protections from liability under “ability to repay” provisions for “qualified mortgages” the cfpb’s rulemaking also included limitations on certain fees and loan officer compensation requirements these rules were effective january 2014 although we do not expect these new requirements to significantly impact our mortgage business fee restrictions may impact our ability to provide a comprehensive package of mortgage services to our homebuyers 

seasonality 

overall we do not experience material seasonal fluctuations in sales settlements or loan closings 

 

effective tax rate 

our consolidated effective tax rate in 2013 2012 and 2011 was 3636 3435 and 3765 respectively during 2012 we reduced our provision for unrecognized tax benefits by 9154 which reduced the 2012 effective tax rate the reduction resulted from settlements with and an audit by certain taxing authorities during 2012 which led us to update our evaluation of the administrative practice in other states for similar uncertain tax positions to determine whether the positions taken in those states were effectively settled see note 11 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements herein for further discussion of income taxes 

recent accounting pronouncements pending adoption 

there have not been any pronouncements issued but not yet implemented that we believe will have a material impact on our financial statements

equity repurchases 

in addition to funding growth in our homebuilding and mortgage banking operations we historically have used a substantial portion of our excess liquidity to repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock in open market and privately negotiated transactions this ongoing repurchase activity is conducted pursuant to publicly announced board authorizations and is typically executed in accordance with the safeharbor provisions of rule 10b18 promulgated under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended in addition the board resolutions authorizing us to repurchase shares of our common stock specifically prohibit us from purchasing shares from our officers directors profit sharing401k plan trust or employee stock ownership plan trust the repurchase program assists us in accomplishing our primary objective creating increases in shareholder value see part ii item 5 of this form 10k for disclosure of amounts repurchased during the fourth quarter of 2013 for the year ended december 31 2013 we repurchased 581387 shares of our common stock at an aggregate purchase price of 554491 as of december 31 2013 we had approximately 438100 available under two board approved repurchase authorizations

for the year ended december 31 2013 cash and cash equivalents decreased by 287254 net cash provided by operating activities was 270222 cash was provided by homebuilding operations and by an increase of 114456 in accounts payable accrued expenses and customer deposits in 2013 compared to 2012 accounts payables were higher due primarily to an increase in our inventory levels while accrued expenses were higher due to the aforementioned increased warranty reserves and income taxes payable attributable to our increased earnings cash was used to fund the increase to homebuilding inventory of 52861 due to increased units under construction at the end of 2013 compared to 2012 in addition cash was used to fund the 40034 increase in contract land deposits year over year investing activities during 2013 used net cash of 34477 primarily as a result of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures totaling 22850 see note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included herein for additional discussion of joint ventures cash was also used for the purchase of property plant and equipment totaling 19016 during 2013 these uses of cash from investing activities were partially offset by capital distributions of 6782 received from our unconsolidated joint ventures net cash used in financing activities was 522999 due primarily to our purchase of treasury stock during 2013 we repurchased 581387 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of 554491 under our ongoing common stock repurchase program as discussed above this use of cash from financing activities was partially offset by 13957 in proceeds from stock option exercises and the realization of 20636 in excess income tax benefits from equitybased compensation plan activity and deferred compensation plan distributions 

for the year ended december 31 2012 cash and cash equivalents increased by 672713 net cash provided by operating activities was 264384 cash was provided by homebuilding operations and by an approximate 63400 decrease in mortgage loans held for sale in addition cash was provided by an increase of 110396 in accounts payable accrued expenses and customer deposits in 2012 compared to 2011 payables were higher due primarily to an increase in our inventory levels the increase in accrued expenses and customer deposits were attributable to increased management incentive accruals associated with our improved financial results and an increase in customer deposits associated with increased sales volume cash provided by homebuilding operations was used to fund the increase to homebuilding inventory of 97750 as a result of an increase in the units under construction at the end of 2012 compared to 2011 in addition cash was used to fund the 53942 increase in contract land deposits year over year investing activities during 2012 used net cash of 22611 primarily as a result of the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of heartland homes on december 31 2012 see note 16 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included herein for additional discussion of the acquisition in addition cash was used for the purchase of property plant and equipment totaling 12365 during 2012 these uses of cash from investing activities were partially offset by capital distributions received from our unconsolidated joint ventures net cash provided by financing activities was 430940 due primarily to the receipt of 593866 in net proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes and 73211 in proceeds from stock option exercises during 2012 we spent 227281 to repurchase 285495 shares of our common stock in addition cash was used in the repayment of 21910 of loans assumed in the acquisition of heartland homes 

 

for the year ended december 31 2011 cash and cash equivalents decreased by 712956 net cash provided by operating activities was 1463 cash provided by homebuilding operations was used to fund the increase to homebuilding inventory of 99527 as a result of an increase in the units under construction at the end of 2011 compared to 2010 in addition cash was used to fund the 42385 increase in contract land deposits the presentation of operating cash flows was reduced by 22835 which is the amount of the excess tax benefit realized from stock option exercises and deferred compensation plan distributions during 2011 and credited directly to additional paid in capital investing activities during 2011 used net cash of 61866 primarily as a result of our investment in a joint venture with morgan stanley real estate investing of 61250 in addition cash was used to purchase 11444 in property plant and equipment during 2011 these uses of cash from investing activities were partially offset by capital distributions received from our unconsolidated joint ventures net cash used by financing activities was 652553 during 2011 we spent approximately 689300 to repurchase 1017588 shares of our common stock under our ongoing common stock repurchase program as discussed above in addition cash was used in the repayment of approximately 90000 of the outstanding nvrm repurchase facility due to our decision to substantially reduce the available credit capacity under the repurchase agreement these uses of cash from financing activities were offset partially by equitybased activity which provided stock option exercise proceeds of 106999 and the realization of 22835 in excess income tax benefits from equitybased compensation plan activity 

at december 31 2013 and 2012 the homebuilding segment had restricted cash of 20563 and 19661 respectively which is included in “other assets” on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets the restricted cash balances relate primarily to holding requirements for outstanding letters of credit issued under our letter of credit agreement and customer deposits for certain home sales 

we believe that our current cash holdings cash generated from operations and the public debt and equity markets will be sufficient to satisfy near and long term cash requirements for working capital and debt service in both our homebuilding and mortgage banking operations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

lot acquisition strategy 

we generally do not engage in land development instead we typically acquire finished building lots at market prices from various land developers under fixed price purchase agreements that require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the agreement the deposits required under the purchase agreements are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percentage typically ranging up to 10 of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots 

we believe that our lot acquisition strategy reduces the financial requirements and risks associated with direct land ownership and land development we may at our option choose for any reason and at any time not to perform under these purchase agreements by delivering notice of our intent not to acquire the finished lots under contract our sole legal obligation and economic loss for failure to perform under these purchase agreements is limited to the amount of the deposit pursuant to the liquidated damage provision contained in the purchase agreements we do not have any financial guarantees or completion obligations and we typically do not guarantee lot purchases on a specific performance basis under these purchase agreements 

at december 31 2013 we controlled approximately 64600 lots through lot purchase agreements joint ventures and land under development with an aggregate purchase price of approximately 5800000 these lots are controlled by making or committing to make deposits of approximately 372400 in the form of cash and letters of credit our entire risk of loss pertaining to the aggregate purchase price contractual commitment resulting from our nonperformance under the contracts is limited to our 299100 deposit paid plus the additional 73300 referred to below of the 299100 deposit total approximately 296600 was in cash and approximately 2500 was in letters of credit which had been issued as of december 31 2013 the remaining 

 

balance of approximately 73300 relates to deposits to be paid subsequent to december 31 2013 assuming that contractual development milestones are met by the developers see contractual obligations section below as of december 31 2013 we had recorded an impairment valuation allowance of approximately 59800 related to certain cash deposits currently outstanding please refer to note 1 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of the contract land deposits and note 3 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of our lot acquisition strategy in relation to our accounting related to variable interest entities 

bonds and letters of credit 

we enter into bond or letter of credit arrangements with local municipalities government agencies or land developers to collateralize our obligations under various contracts we had approximately 54500 of contingent obligations under such agreements as of december 31 2013 inclusive of the 2500 of lot acquisition deposits in the form of letters of credit discussed above we believe we will fulfill our obligations under the related contracts and do not anticipate any material losses under these bonds or letters of credit 

mortgage commitments and forward sales 

in the normal course of business our mortgage banking segment enters into contractual commitments to extend credit to buyers of singlefamily homes with fixed expiration dates the commitments become effective when the borrowers “lockin” a specified interest rate within time frames established by us all mortgagors are evaluated for credit worthiness prior to the extension of the commitment market risk arises if interest rates move adversely between the time of the “lockin” of rates by the borrower and the sale date of the loan to a brokerdealer to mitigate the effect of the interest rate risk inherent in providing rate lock commitments to borrowers we enter into optional or mandatory delivery forward sale contracts to sell whole loans and mortgagebacked securities to brokerdealers the forward sale contracts lock in an interest rate and price for the sale of loans similar to the specific rate lock commitments we do not engage in speculative or trading derivative activities both the rate lock commitments to borrowers and the forward sale contracts to brokerdealers are undesignated derivatives and accordingly are marked to fair value through earnings at december 31 2013 there were contractual commitments to extend credit to borrowers aggregating 243084 and open forward delivery contracts aggregating 430859 please refer to note 14 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of our fair value accounting 

contractual obligations 

our fixed noncancelable obligations as of december 31 2013 were as follows 

 

  

  

      critical accounting policies 

general 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods we continually evaluate the estimates we use to prepare the consolidated financial statements and update those estimates as necessary in general our estimates are based on historical experience on information from third party professionals and other various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances actual results could differ materially from those estimates made by management 

homebuilding inventory 

the carrying value of inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market value cost of lots and completed and uncompleted housing units represent the accumulated actual cost of the units field construction supervisors’ salaries and related direct overhead expenses are included in inventory costs interest costs are not capitalized into inventory with the exception of land under development upon settlement the cost of the unit is expensed on a specific identification basis cost of production materials is determined on a firstin firstout basis 

sold inventory is evaluated for impairment based on the contractual selling price compared to the total estimated cost to construct unsold inventory is evaluated for impairment by analyzing recent comparable sale prices within the applicable community compared to the costs incurred to date plus the expected costs to complete any calculated impairments are recorded immediately 

 

land under development and contract land deposits 

land under development 

on a very limited basis we directly acquire raw parcels of land already zoned for its intended use to develop into finished lots land under development includes the land acquisition costs direct improvement costs capitalized interest where applicable and real estate taxes 

land under development including the land under development held by our unconsolidated joint ventures and the related joint venture investments is reviewed for potential writedowns when impairment indicators are present in addition to considering market and economic conditions we assess land under development impairments on a communitybycommunity basis analyzing as applicable current sales absorption levels recent sales’ gross profit and the dollar differential between the projected fullydeveloped cost of the lots and the current market price for lots if indicators of impairment are present for a community we perform an analysis to determine if the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts and if they are impairment charges are required to be recorded in an amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets our determination of fair value is primarily based on discounting the estimated future cash flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams 

at december 31 2013 we had approximately 41300 in land under development in five separate communities in addition at december 31 2013 we had an aggregate investment totaling approximately 92700 in four separate joint ventures that controlled land under development none of the communities classified as land under development nor any of the undeveloped land held by the joint ventures had any indicators of impairment at december 31 2013 as such we do not believe that any of the land under development is impaired at this time however there can be no assurance that we will not incur impairment charges in the future due to unanticipated adverse changes in the economy or other events adversely affecting specific markets or the homebuilding industry 

contract land deposits 

we purchase finished lots under fixed price purchase agreements that require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the contract the deposits are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percentage of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots 

we maintain an allowance for losses on contract land deposits that reflects our judgment of the present loss exposure in the existing contract land deposit portfolio at the end of the reporting period to analyze contract land deposit impairments we utilize a loss contingency analysis that is conducted each quarter in addition to considering market and economic conditions we assess contract land deposit impairments on a communitybycommunity basis pursuant to the purchase contract terms analyzing as applicable current sales absorption levels recent sales’ gross profit the dollar differential between the contractual purchase price and the current market price for lots a developer’s financial stability a developer’s financial ability or willingness to reduce lot prices to current market prices and the contract’s default status by either us or the developer along with an analysis of the expected outcome of any such default 

our analysis is focused on whether we can sell houses profitably in a particular community in the current market with which we are faced because we do not own the finished lots on which we had placed a contract land deposit if the above analysis leads to a determination that we cannot sell homes profitably at the current contractual lot price we then determine whether we will elect to default under the contract forfeit our deposit and terminate the contract or whether we will attempt to restructure the lot purchase contract which may require us to forfeit the deposit to obtain contract concessions from a developer we also assess whether an impairment is present due to collectability issues resulting from a developer’s nonperformance because of financial or other conditions 

 

although we consider the allowance for losses on contract land deposits reflected on the december 31 2013 consolidated balance sheet to be adequate see note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included herein there can be no assurance that this allowance will prove to be adequate over time to cover losses due to unanticipated adverse changes in the economy or other events adversely affecting specific markets or the homebuilding industry 

excess reorganization value 

reorganization value in excess of identifiable assets “excess reorganization value” is an indefinitelived intangible asset that was created upon our emergence from bankruptcy on september 30 1993 based on the allocation of our reorganization value the portion of our reorganization value which was not attributed to specific tangible or intangible assets has been reported as excess reorganization value which is treated similarly to goodwill excess reorganization value is not subject to amortization rather excess reorganization value is subject to an impairment assessment on an annual basis or more frequently if changes in events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred because excess reorganization value was based on the reorganization value of our entire enterprise upon bankruptcy emergence the impairment assessment is conducted on an enterprise basis based on the comparison of our total equity compared to the market value of our outstanding publiclytraded common stock we do not believe that excess reorganization value is impaired at this time however changes in strategy or adverse changes in market conditions could impact this judgment and require an impairment loss to be recognized if our book value including excess reorganization value exceeds the fair value 

warranty  product liability accruals 

warranty and product liability accruals are established to provide for estimated future costs as a result of construction and product defects product recalls and litigation incidental to our business liability estimates are determined based on our judgment considering such factors as historical experience the likely current cost of corrective action manufacturers’ and subcontractors’ participation in sharing the cost of corrective action consultations with third party experts such as engineers and evaluations by our general counsel and outside counsel retained to handle specific product liability cases although we consider the warranty and product liability accrual reflected on the december 31 2013 consolidated balance sheet to be adequate see note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included herein there can be no assurance that this accrual will prove to be adequate over time to cover losses due to increased costs for material and labor the inability or refusal of manufacturers or subcontractors to financially participate in corrective action unanticipated adverse legal settlements or other unanticipated changes to the assumptions used to estimate the warranty and product liability accrual 

equitybased compensation expense 

compensation costs related to our equitybased compensation plans are recognized within our income statement the costs recognized are based on the grantdate fair value compensation cost for sharebased grants is recognized on a straightline basis over the requisite service period for the entire award from the date of grant through the period of the last separately vesting portion of the grant 

we calculate the fair value of our nonpublicly traded employee stock options using the blackscholes optionpricing model while the blackscholes model is a widely accepted method to calculate the fair value of options its results are dependent on input variables two of which expected term and expected volatility are significantly dependent on management’s judgment we have concluded that our historical exercise experience is the best estimate of future exercise patterns to determine an option’s expected term to estimate expected volatility we analyze the historical volatility of our common stock over a period equal to the option’s expected term changes in management’s judgment of the expected term and the expected volatility could have a material effect on the grantdate fair value calculated and expensed within the income statement in addition we are required to estimate future grant forfeitures when considering the amount of stockbased 

 

compensation costs to record we have concluded that our historical forfeiture rate is the best measure to base our estimate of future forfeitures of equitybased compensation grants however there can be no assurance that our future forfeiture rate will not be materially higher or lower than our historical forfeiture rate which would affect the aggregate cumulative compensation expense recognized 

mortgage loan loss allowance 

we originate several different loan products to our customers to finance the purchase of their home we sell all of the loans we originate into the secondary mortgage market generally within 30 days from origination all of the loans that we originate are underwritten to the standards and specifications of the ultimate investor insofar as we underwrite our originated loans to those standards we bear no increased concentration of credit risk from the issuance of loans except in certain limited instances where early payment default occurs those underwriting standards are typically equal to or more stringent than the underwriting standards required by fnma va and fha we employ a quality control department to ensure that our underwriting controls are effectively operating and further assess the underwriting function as part of our assessment of internal controls over financial reporting we maintain an allowance for losses on mortgage loans originated that reflects our judgment of the present loss exposure in the loans that we have originated and sold the allowance is calculated based on an analysis of historical experience and exposure although we consider the allowance for loan losses reflected on the december 31 2013 consolidated balance sheet to be adequate see note 15 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included herein there can be no assurance that this allowance will prove to be adequate over time to cover losses due to unanticipated changes to the assumptions used to estimate the mortgage loan loss allowance 

impact of inflation changing prices and economic conditions

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk tableend market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates our market risk arises from interest rate risk inherent in our financial instruments and debt obligations interest rate risk results from the possibility that changes in interest rates will cause unfavorable changes in net income or in the value of interest ratesensitive assets liabilities and commitments lower interest rates tend to increase demand for mortgage loans for home purchasers while higher interest rates make it more difficult for potential borrowers to purchase residential properties and to qualify for mortgage loans we have no market rate sensitive instruments held for speculative or trading purposes 

our homebuilding segment is exposed to interest rate risk as it relates to its debt obligations in september 2012 we issued 600000 of senior notes the senior notes mature on september 15 2022 and bear interest at 395 payable semiannually in arrears on march 15 and september 15 commencing on march 15 2013 changes to interest rates generally affect the fair value of fixedrate debt instruments but not earnings or cash flows we generally have no obligation to prepay the senior notes prior to maturity and therefore interest rate fluctuations should not have a significant impact on our fixedrate debt 

our mortgage banking segment is exposed to interest rate risk as it relates to its lending activities the mortgage banking segment originates mortgage loans which are sold through either optional or mandatory forward delivery contracts into the secondary markets all of the mortgage banking segment’s loan portfolio is held for sale and subject to forward sale commitments nvrm also sells all of its mortgages held for sale on a servicing released basis 

nvrm has available a mortgage repurchase agreement which provides for loan repurchases up to 25000 subject to certain sub limits the repurchase agreement is used to fund nvrm’s mortgage origination activities advances under the repurchase agreement carry a pricing rate based on the libor rate plus the 

 

libor margin or the default pricing rate as determined under the repurchase agreement provided that the pricing rate shall not be less than 300 at december 31 2013 there was no debt outstanding under the repurchase agreement 

the following table represents the contractual balances of our onbalance sheet financial instruments at the expected maturity dates as well as the fair values of those onbalance sheet financial instruments at december 31 2013 the table does not include the debt of our consolidated joint venture as it is nonrecourse to us the expected maturity categories take into consideration the actual and anticipated amortization of principal and do not take into consideration the reinvestment of cash or the refinancing of existing indebtedness because we sell all of the mortgage loans we originate into the secondary markets we have made the assumption that the portfolio of mortgage loans held for sale will mature in the first year consequently advances outstanding under the repurchase agreement would also be assumed to mature in the first year

 item 1 business tableend general 

nvr inc “nvr” was formed in 1980 as nvhomes inc our primary business is the construction and sale of singlefamily detached homes townhomes and condominium buildings all of which are primarily constructed on a presold basis to more fully serve customers of our homebuilding operations we also operate a mortgage banking and title services business we conduct our homebuilding activities directly our mortgage banking operations are operated primarily through a wholly owned subsidiary nvr mortgage finance inc “nvrm” unless the context otherwise requires references to “nvr” “we” “us” or “our” include nvr and its consolidated subsidiaries 

we are one of the largest homebuilders in the united states while we operate in multiple locations in fifteen states and washington dc primarily in the eastern part of the united states approximately 38 of our home settlements in 2012 occurred in the washington dc and baltimore md metropolitan areas which accounted for approximately 47 of our 2012 homebuilding revenues our homebuilding operations include the construction and sale of singlefamily detached homes townhomes and condominium buildings under four trade names ryan homes nvhomes fox ridge homes and as of january 1 2013 heartland homes which we acquired on december 31 2012 see item 7 herein for additional discussion of the heartland homes acquisition the ryan homes and fox ridge homes products are marketed primarily to firsttime and firsttime moveup buyers ryan homes operates in twentyseven metropolitan areas located in maryland virginia washington dc west virginia pennsylvania new york north carolina south carolina florida ohio new jersey delaware indiana illinois kentucky and tennessee the fox ridge homes product is sold solely in the nashville tn metropolitan area the nvhomes and heartland homes products are marketed primarily to moveup and upscale buyers the nvhomes product is sold in delaware and the washington dc baltimore md and philadelphia pa metropolitan areas the heartland homes product is sold in the pittsburgh pa metropolitan area in 2012 our average price of a settled unit was approximately 317100 

historically we generally have not engaged in land development see discussion below on our limited land development activities instead we typically acquire finished building lots at market prices from various development entities under fixed price purchase agreements “purchase agreements” that require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the purchase agreement the deposits required under the purchase agreements are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percentage typically ranging up to 10 of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots 

we believe that our lot acquisition strategy avoids the financial requirements and risks associated with direct land ownership and land development we may at our option choose for any reason and at any time not to perform under these purchase agreements by delivering notice of our intent not to acquire the finished lots under contract our sole legal obligation and economic loss for failure to perform under these purchase agreements is limited to the amount of the deposit pursuant to the liquidated damage provision contained within the purchase agreements we do not have any financial guarantees or completion obligations and we typically do not guarantee lot purchases on a specific performance basis under these purchase agreements none of the creditors of any of the development entities with which we have entered these purchase agreements have recourse to our general credit we generally seek to maintain control over a supply of lots believed to be suitable to meet our fiveyear business plan 

our continued success is contingent upon our ability to control an adequate supply of finished lots on which to build and on our developers’ ability to timely deliver finished lots to meet the sales demands of our customers however during the past several years the impact of economic conditions on the homebuilding industry has negatively impacted our developers’ ability to obtain acquisition and development financing or to raise equity investments to finance land development activity potentially constraining our supply of finished lots this pressure has necessitated that in certain specific strategic circumstances we deviate from our historical lot 

  

acquisition strategy and engage in joint venture arrangements with land developers or directly acquire raw ground already zoned for its intended use for development once we acquire control of any raw ground we determine whether to sell the raw parcel to a developer and enter into a fixed price purchase agreement with the developer to purchase the finished lots or whether to hire a developer to develop the land on our behalf while joint venture arrangements and direct land development activity are not our preferred method of acquiring finished building lots we may enter into additional transactions in the future on a limited basis where there exists a compelling strategic or prudent financial reason to do so we expect however to continue to acquire substantially all of our finished lot inventory using fixed price purchase agreements with forfeitable deposits 

as of december 31 2012 we controlled approximately 53200 lots under purchase agreements with deposits in cash and letters of credit totaling approximately 2566 million and 33 million respectively included in the number of controlled lots are approximately 10200 lots for which we have recorded a contract land deposit impairment reserve of approximately 650 million as of december 31 2012 in addition we had an aggregate investment totaling approximately 829 million in four separate joint venture limited liability corporations “jvs” expected to produce approximately 7400 lots of the lots controlled by the jvs approximately 2800 were not under contract with us at december 31 2012 further as of december 31 2012 we directly owned three separate raw parcels of land zoned for their intended use with a current cost basis including development costs of approximately 683 million that we intend to develop into approximately 700 finished lots for use in our homebuilding operations see note 3 and note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information regarding jvs and land under development respectively 

in addition to building and selling homes we provide a number of mortgagerelated services through our mortgage banking operations through operations in each of our homebuilding markets nvrm originates mortgage loans almost exclusively for our homebuyers nvrm generates revenues primarily from origination fees gains on sales of loans and title fees nvrm sells all of the mortgage loans it closes into the secondary markets on a servicing released basis 

segment information for our homebuilding and mortgage banking businesses is included in note 2 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

current business environment 

during the current year the homebuilding market continued to experience a stabilization in prices and improving sales trends these favorable market conditions are driven by improved housing affordability levels resulting from historically low mortgage interest rates and rising costs in the rental market despite these improvements the homebuilding environment continues to face challenges from a tight mortgage lending environment consumer confidence issues due to sustained high levels of unemployment and uncertainties as to the sustainability of the economic recovery for additional information and analysis of recent trends in our operations and financial condition see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 of this form 10k

backlog totaled 4979 units and approximately 17 billion at december 31 2012 compared to backlog of 3676 units and approximately 12 billion at december 31 2011 backlog which represents homes sold but not yet settled with the customer may be impacted by customer cancellations for various reasons that are beyond our control such as failure to obtain mortgage financing inability to sell an existing home job loss or a variety of other reasons in any period a portion of the cancellations that we experience are related to new sales that occurred during the same period and a portion are related to sales that occurred in prior periods and therefore appeared in the opening backlog for the current period expressed as the total of all cancellations during the period as a percentage of gross sales during the period our cancellation rate was approximately 15 in 2012 and 14 in both 2011 and 2010 during each of 2012 2011 and 2010 approximately 6 of a quarter’s opening backlog balance cancelled during the fiscal quarter we can provide no assurance that our historical cancellation rates are indicative of the actual cancellation rate that may occur in future periods see “risk factors” in item 1a of this form 10k 

further discussion of settlements new orders and backlog activity by homebuilding reportable segment for each of the last three years can be found in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 of this form 10k 

construction 

we utilize independent subcontractors under fixed price contracts to perform construction work on our homes we use several independent subcontractors in our various markets and we are not dependent on any single subcontractor or on a small number of subcontractors 

sales and marketing 

our preferred marketing method is for customers to visit a furnished model home featuring many builtin options and a landscaped lot the garages of these model homes are usually converted into temporary sales centers where alternative facades and floor plans are displayed and designs for other models are available for review sales representatives are compensated predominantly on a commission basis 

regulation 

we and our subcontractors must comply with various federal state and local zoning building environmental advertising and consumer credit statutes rules and regulations as well as other regulations and requirements in connection with our construction and sales activities all of these regulations have increased the cost to produce and market our products and in some instances have delayed our developers’ ability to deliver finished lots to us counties and cities in which we build homes have at times declared moratoriums on the issuance of building permits and imposed other restrictions in the areas in which sewage treatment facilities and other public facilities do not reach minimum standards to date restrictive zoning laws and the imposition of moratoriums have not had a material adverse effect on our construction activities 

  

competition and market factors 

the housing industry is highly competitive we compete with numerous homebuilders of varying size ranging from local to national in scope some of which have greater financial resources than we do we also face competition from the home resale market our homebuilding operations compete primarily on the basis of price location design quality service and reputation historically we have been one of the market leaders in each of the markets where we build homes 

the housing industry is cyclical and is affected by consumer confidence levels prevailing economic conditions and interest rates other factors that affect the housing industry and the demand for new homes include the availability and the cost of land labor and materials changes in consumer preferences demographic trends and the availability of mortgage finance programs see “risk factors” in item 1a of this form 10k 

we are dependent upon building material suppliers for a continuous flow of raw materials whenever possible we utilize standard products available from multiple sources in the past such raw materials have been generally available to us in adequate supply 

mortgage banking 

we provide a number of mortgage related services to our homebuilding customers through our mortgage banking operations our mortgage banking operations also include separate subsidiaries that broker title insurance and perform title searches in connection with mortgage loan closings for which they receive commissions and fees because nvrm originates mortgage loans almost exclusively for our homebuilding customers nvrm is dependent on our homebuilding segment in 2012 nvrm closed approximately 8000 loans with an aggregate principal amount of approximately 22 billion as compared to approximately 7000 loans with an aggregate principal amount of approximately 19 billion in 2011 

nvrm sells all of the mortgage loans it closes to investors in the secondary markets on a servicing released basis typically within 30 days from the loan closing nvrm is an approved sellerservicer for fnma mortgage loans and an approved sellerissuer of gnma fhlmc va and fha mortgage loans 

competition and market factors 

nvrm’s main competition comes from national regional and local mortgage bankers mortgage brokers thrifts and banks in each of these markets nvrm competes primarily on the basis of customer service variety of products offered interest rates offered prices of ancillary services and relative financing availability and costs 

regulation 

nvrm is an approved sellerservicer of fnma mortgage loans and an approved sellerissuer of gnma fhlmc va and fha mortgage loans and is subject to all of those agencies’ rules and regulations these rules and regulations restrict certain activities of nvrm nvrm is currently eligible and expects to remain eligible to participate in such programs in addition nvrm is subject to regulation at the state and federal level with respect to specific origination selling and servicing practices 

pipeline 

nvrm’s mortgage loans in process that have not closed “pipeline” at december 31 2012 and 2011 had an aggregate principal balance of approximately 11 billion and 790 million respectively nvrm’s cancellation rate was approximately 36 in 2012 during both 2011 and 2010 nvrm’s loan cancellation rates were approximately 29 we can provide no assurance that our historical loan cancellation rates are indicative of the actual loan cancellation rate that may occur in future periods see “risk factors” in item 1a in this form 10k 

  

employees 

at december 31 2012 we employed 3291 fulltime persons none of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement and we have never experienced a work stoppage we believe that our employee relations are good

our business is affected by the risks generally incident to the residential construction business including but not limited to 

 

  

  

  

  

 all of these risks are discussed in detail below 

the homebuilding industry experienced a significant downturn over the past several years which could continue to adversely affect our business and our results of operations 

over the past several years the homebuilding industry experienced a significant downturn as a result of low consumer confidence driven by an economic recession high unemployment levels affordability issues and uncertainty as to the stability of home prices as a result we experienced reduced demand for new homes during 2012 we began to see signs of strengthening within the homebuilding industry with increasing sales and stabilization of selling prices in many markets however the housing market continues to face challenges from a tight mortgage lending environment and consumer confidence issues due to sustained high levels of unemployment the downturn experienced in the homebuilding industry could have a material adverse effect on our sales either through fewer gross sales andor higher cancellation rates which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

if the market value of our inventory or controlled lot position declines our profit could decrease and we may incur losses 

inventory risk can be substantial for homebuilders the market value of building lots and housing inventories can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing market conditions in addition inventory carrying costs can be significant and can result in losses in a poorly performing project or market we must in the ordinary course of our business continuously seek and make acquisitions of lots for expansion into new markets as well as for replacement and expansion within our current markets which is generally accomplished by us entering fixed price purchase agreements and paying forfeitable deposits under the purchase agreement to developers for the contractual right to acquire the lots in the event of further adverse changes in economic or market conditions we may cease further building activities in communities or restructure existing purchase agreements resulting in forfeiture of some or all of any remaining land contract deposit paid to the developer either action may result in a loss which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

if the underwriting quality of our mortgage originations is found to be deficient our profit could decrease and we may incur losses 

we originate several different loan products to our customers to finance the purchase of their home we sell all of the loans we originate into the secondary mortgage market generally within 30 days from origination all of the loans that we originate are underwritten to the standards and specifications of the ultimate investor insofar as we underwrite our originated loans to those standards we bear no increased concentration of credit risk from the issuance of loans except in certain limited instances where early payment default occurs in the event that a substantial number of the loans that we have originated fall into default and the investors to whom we sold the loan determine that we did not underwrite the loan in accordance with their requirements we could be required to repurchase the loans from the investor or indemnify the investor for any losses incurred this may result in losses which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

  

because almost all of our customers require mortgage financing the availability of suitable mortgage financing could impair the affordability of our homes lower demand for our products and limit our ability to fully deliver our backlog 

our business and earnings depend on the ability of our potential customers to obtain mortgages for the purchase of our homes in addition many of our potential customers must sell their existing homes in order to buy a home from us the tightening of credit standards and the availability of suitable mortgage financing could prevent customers from buying our homes and could prevent buyers of our customers’ homes from obtaining mortgages they need to complete that purchase both of which could result in our potential customers’ inability to buy a home from us if our potential customers or the buyers of our customers’ current homes are not able to obtain suitable financing the result could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

if our ability to sell mortgages to investors is impaired we may be required to fund these commitments ourselves or may not be able to originate loans at all 

our mortgage banking business sells all of the loans it originates into the secondary market usually within 30 days from the date of closing and has up to approximately 25 million available in a repurchase agreement to fund mortgage closings in the event that disruptions to the secondary markets similar to those which occurred during 2007 and 2008 continue to tighten or eliminate the available liquidity within the secondary markets for mortgage loans or the underwriting requirements by our secondary market investors continue to become more stringent our ability to sell future mortgages could decline and we could be required among other things to fund our commitments to our buyers with our own financial resources which is limited or require our home buyers to find another source of financing the result of such secondary market disruption could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

interest rate movements inflation and other economic factors can negatively impact our business 

high rates of inflation generally affect the homebuilding industry adversely because of their adverse impact on interest rates high interest rates not only increase the cost of borrowed funds to homebuilders but also have a significant effect on housing demand and on the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective purchasers we are also subject to potential volatility in the price of commodities that impact costs of materials used in our homebuilding business increases in prevailing interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

our financial results also are affected by the risks generally incident to our mortgage banking business including interest rate levels the impact of government regulation on mortgage loan originations and servicing and the need to issue forward commitments to fund and sell mortgage loans our homebuilding customers account for almost all of our mortgage banking business the volume of our continuing homebuilding operations therefore affects our mortgage banking business 

our mortgage banking business also is affected by interest rate fluctuations we also may experience marketing losses resulting from daily increases in interest rates to the extent we are unable to match interest rates and amounts on loans we have committed to originate with forward commitments from third parties to purchase such loans increases in interest rates may have a material adverse effect on our mortgage banking revenue profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

our operations may also be adversely affected by other economic factors within our markets such as negative changes in employment levels job growth and consumer confidence and availability of mortgage financing one or all of which could result in reduced demand or price depression from current levels such negative trends could have a material adverse effect on homebuilding operations 

  

these factors and thus the homebuilding business have at times in the past been cyclical in nature any downturn in the national economy or the local economies of the markets in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations in particular approximately 38 of our home settlements during 2012 occurred in the washington dc and baltimore md metropolitan areas which accounted for approximately 47 of our homebuilding revenues in 2012 thus we are dependent to a significant extent on the economy and demand for housing in those areas 

our inability to secure and control an adequate inventory of lots could adversely impact our operations 

the results of our homebuilding operations are dependent upon our continuing ability to control an adequate number of homebuilding lots in desirable locations there can be no assurance that an adequate supply of building lots will continue to be available to us on terms similar to those available in the past or that we will not be required to devote a greater amount of capital to controlling building lots than we have historically an insufficient supply of building lots in one or more of our markets an inability of our developers to deliver finished lots in a timely fashion due to their inability to secure financing to fund development activities or for other reasons or our inability to purchase or finance building lots on reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

volatility in the credit and capital markets may impact our ability to access necessary financing 

if we require working capital greater than that provided by our operations we may be required to obtain alternative financing no assurance can be given that additional financing will be available on terms that are favorable or acceptable if we are required to seek financing to fund our working capital requirements continued volatility in these markets similar to that experienced in the past several years may restrict our flexibility to access financing if we are at any time unsuccessful in obtaining sufficient capital to fund our planned homebuilding expenditures we may experience a substantial delay in the completion of any homes then under construction or we may be unable to control or purchase finished building lots any delay could result in cost increases and could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

our mortgage banking operations are dependent in part on the availability cost and other terms of mortgage financing facilities and may be adversely affected by any shortage or increased cost of such financing no assurance can be given that any additional or replacement financing will be available on terms that are favorable or acceptable our mortgage banking operations are also dependent upon the securitization market for mortgagebacked securities and could be materially adversely affected by any fluctuation or downturn in such market 

our current indebtedness may impact our future operations 

our existing indebtedness contains restrictive covenants and any future indebtedness may also contain covenants these covenants include or could include restrictions on our ability to create incur assume or guarantee secured debt enter into sale and leaseback transactions and conditions related to mergers andor the sale of assets substantial losses by us or other action or inaction by us or our subsidiaries could result in the violation of one or more of these covenants which could result in decreased liquidity or a default on our current or future indebtedness thereby having a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

government regulations and environmental matters could negatively affect our operations 

we are subject to various local state and federal statutes ordinances rules and regulations concerning zoning building design construction and similar matters including local regulations that impose restrictive zoning and density requirements in order to limit the number of homes that can eventually be built 

  

within the boundaries of a particular area these regulations may further increase the cost to produce and market our products in addition we have from time to time been subject to and may also be subject in the future to periodic delays in our homebuilding projects due to building moratoriums in the areas in which we operate changes in regulations that restrict homebuilding activities in one or more of our principal markets could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

we are also subject to a variety of local state and federal statutes ordinances rules and regulations concerning the protection of health and the environment we are subject to a variety of environmental conditions that can affect our business and our homebuilding projects the particular environmental laws that apply to any given homebuilding site vary greatly according to the location and environmental condition of the site and the present and former uses of the site and adjoining properties environmental laws and conditions may result in delays cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs or prohibit or severely restrict homebuilding activity in certain environmentally sensitive regions or areas thereby adversely affecting our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

in addition the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act enacted on july 21 2010 contains numerous provisions affecting residential mortgages and mortgage lending practices the consumer financial protection bureau issued rules governing multiple issues in january 2013 including “ability to repay” underwriting provisions appraisal standards servicing and escrow rules and loan officer compensation requirements additional rulemaking is expected within the next couple of months the ultimate impact of such provisions on lending institutions including our mortgage banking subsidiary will depend on the banking industry’s implementation of these new standards 

we are an approved sellerservicer of fnma mortgage loans and an approved sellerissuer of gnma fhlmc va and fha mortgage loans and are subject to all of those agencies’ rules and regulations any significant impairment of our eligibility to sellservice these loans could have a material adverse impact on our mortgage operations in addition we are subject to regulation at the state and federal level with respect to specific origination selling and servicing practices including the real estate settlement and protection act adverse changes in governmental regulation may have a negative impact on our mortgage loan origination business 

we face competition in our housing and mortgage banking operations 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive we compete with numerous homebuilders of varying size ranging from local to national in scope some of whom have greater financial resources than we do we face competition 

 

  

  

 our homebuilding operations compete primarily on the basis of price location design quality service and reputation 

the mortgage banking industry is also competitive our main competition comes from national regional and local mortgage bankers thrifts banks and mortgage brokers in each of these markets our mortgage banking operations compete primarily on the basis of customer service variety of products offered interest rates offered prices of ancillary services and relative financing availability and costs 

there can be no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully in our homebuilding or mortgage banking operations an inability to effectively compete may have an adverse impact on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

  

a shortage of building materials or labor or increases in materials or labor costs may adversely impact our operations 

the homebuilding business has from time to time experienced building material and labor shortages including shortages in insulation drywall certain carpentry work and concrete as well as fluctuating lumber prices and supply in addition strong construction market conditions could restrict the labor force available to our subcontractors and us in one or more of our markets significant increases in costs resulting from these shortages or delays in construction of homes could have a material adverse effect upon our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

product liability litigation and warranty claims may adversely impact our operations 

construction defect and home warranty claims are common and can represent a substantial risk for the homebuilding industry the cost of insuring against construction defect and product liability related claims as well as the claims themselves can be high in addition insurance companies limit coverage offered to protect against these claims further restrictions on coverage availability or significant increases in premium costs or claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

we are subject to litigation proceedings that could harm our business if an unfavorable ruling were to occur 

from time to time we may become involved in litigation and other legal proceedings relating to claims arising from our operations in the normal course of business as described in but not limited to part i item 3 “legal proceedings” of this form 10k we are currently subject to certain legal proceedings litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings may occur we cannot assure you that these or other litigation or legal proceedings will not materially affect our ability to conduct our business in the manner that we expect or otherwise adversely affect us should an unfavorable ruling occur 

weatherrelated and other events beyond our control may adversely impact our operations 

extreme weather or other events such as significant snowfalls hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes forest fires floods terrorist attacks or war may affect our markets our operations and our profitability these events may impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or subcontractors causing us material increases in costs or delays in construction of homes which could have a material adverse effect upon our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows

 item 2 properties 

our corporate offices are located in reston virginia where we currently lease approximately 61000 square feet of office space the current corporate office lease expires in april 2015 

in connection with the operation of the homebuilding segment we lease manufacturing facilities in the following six locations thurmont maryland burlington county new jersey farmington new york kings mountain north carolina darlington pennsylvania and portland tennessee these facilities range in size from approximately 40000 square feet to 400000 square feet and combined total approximately 1 million square feet of manufacturing space each of these leases contains various options for extensions of the lease and for the purchase of the facility the portland lease expires in 2014 the thurmont and farmington leases expire in 2019 the kings mountain and burlington county leases expire in 2022 and 2023 respectively and the darlington lease expires in 2025 we own a manufacturing facility in dayton ohio which contains approximately 100000 square feet of manufacturing space our current plant utilization has remained flat with the prior year at 31 of total capacity 

  

we also in connection with both our homebuilding and mortgage banking businesses lease office space in multiple locations for homebuilding divisional offices and mortgage banking and title services branches under leases expiring at various times through 2020 none of which are individually material to our business we anticipate that upon expiration of existing leases we will be able to renew them or obtain comparable facilities on terms acceptable to us

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend on july 18 2007 former and current employees filed lawsuits against us in the court of common pleas in allegheny county pennsylvania and hamilton county ohio in superior court in durham county north carolina and in the circuit court in montgomery county maryland and on july 19 2007 in the superior court in new jersey alleging that we incorrectly classified our sales and marketing representatives as being exempt from overtime wages these lawsuits are similar in nature to another lawsuit filed on october 29 2004 by another former employee in the united states district court for the western district of new york the complaints seek injunctive relief an award of unpaid wages including fringe benefits liquidated damages equal to the overtime wages allegedly due and not paid attorney and other fees and interest and where available multiple damages the suits were filed as purported class actions however while a number of individuals have filed consents to join and assert federal claims in the new york action none of the groups of employees that the lawsuits purport to represent have been certified as a class and we have filed a motion to decertify the federal collective action claim and dismiss the individuals who filed consents from the case the lawsuits filed in ohio pennsylvania maryland new jersey and north carolina have been stayed pending further developments in the new york action 

we believe that our compensation practices in regard to sales and marketing representatives are entirely lawful and in compliance with two letter rulings from the united states department of labor “dol” issued in january 2007 courts that have considered similar claims against other homebuilders have acknowledged the dol’s position that sales and marketing representatives were properly classified as exempt from overtime wages and the only court to have directly addressed the exempt status of such employees concluded that the dol’s position was valid accordingly we have vigorously defended and intend to continue to vigorously defend these lawsuits because we are unable to determine the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome of these cases or the amount of damages if any we have not recorded any associated liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 

in june 2010 we received a request for information from the united states environmental protection agency “epa” pursuant to section 308 of the clean water act the request sought information about storm water discharge practices in connection with homebuilding projects completed or underway by us in new york and new jersey we cooperated with this request and provided information to the epa we have since been informed by the united states department of justice “doj” that the epa forwarded the information on the matter to the doj and the doj requested that we meet with the government to discuss the status of the case meetings took place in january 2012 and august 2012 with representatives from both the epa and doj it is not yet known what next steps if any the doj will take in the matter we intend to continue cooperating with any future epa andor doj inquiries at this time we cannot predict the outcome of this inquiry nor can we reasonably estimate the potential costs that may be associated with its eventual resolution 

in august 2011 the wage and hour division of the dol notified us that it was initiating an investigation to determine our compliance with the fair standards labor act “fsla” in the notice the dol requested certain information including payroll data for a two year period and multiple communityspecific items related to our homebuilding operations we have cooperated with this information request and have either provided or made available the information that the dol has requested the dol has investigated our headquarters two manufacturing facilities and certain of our operating divisions the dol has communicated that it has not found any violations at any of these operations the dol appears to have completed its investigation although in accordance with dol practice we have not been formally notified of such thus we cannot predict whether the dol will investigate our other operations further it is important to understand that under the law the dol can investigate our other operations or even operations that it has previously audited either on its own initiative or in response to an employee complaint we believe that our payroll practices are in compliance with the fsla 

  

we are also involved in various other litigation arising in the ordinary course of business in the opinion of management and based on advice of legal counsel this litigation is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows legal costs incurred in connection with outstanding litigation are expensed as incurred

results of operations for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 

overview 

business 

our primary business is the construction and sale of singlefamily detached homes townhomes and condominium buildings all of which are primarily constructed on a presold basis to fully serve customers of our homebuilding operations we also operate a mortgage banking and title services business we primarily conduct our operations in mature markets additionally we generally grow our business through market share gains in our existing markets and by expanding into markets contiguous to our current active markets our four homebuilding reportable segments consist of the following regions 

 

   

our lot acquisition strategy is predicated upon avoiding the financial requirements and risks associated with direct land ownership and development historically we have not engaged in land development to obtain finished lots for use in our homebuilding operations instead we have acquired finished lots at market prices from various third party land developers pursuant to fixed price purchase agreements these purchase agreements require deposits typically ranging up to 10 of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots in the form of cash or letters of credit that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the purchase agreement this strategy has allowed us to maximize inventory turnover which we believe enables us to minimize market risk and to operate with less capital thereby enhancing rates of return on equity and total capital 

our continued success is contingent upon our ability to control an adequate supply of finished lots on which to build and on our developers’ ability to timely deliver finished lots to meet the sales demands of our customers however during the past several years the impact of economic conditions on the homebuilding industry has negatively impacted our developers’ ability to obtain acquisition and development financing or to raise equity investments to finance land development activity potentially constraining our supply of finished lots this pressure has necessitated that in certain specific strategic circumstances we deviate from our historical lot acquisition strategy and engage in joint venture arrangements with land developers or directly acquire raw ground already zoned for its intended use for development once we acquire control of any raw ground we determine whether to sell the raw parcel to a developer and enter into a fixed price purchase agreement with the developer to purchase the finished lots or whether we will hire a developer to develop the land on our behalf while joint venture arrangements and direct land development activity are not our preferred method of acquiring finished building lots we may enter into additional transactions in the future on a limited basis where there exists a compelling strategic or prudent financial reason to do so we expect however to continue to acquire substantially all of our finished lot inventory using fixed price purchase agreements with forfeitable deposits 

as of december 31 2012 we controlled approximately 53200 lots under purchase agreements with deposits in cash and letters of credit totaling approximately 256600 and 3300 respectively additionally we controlled approximately 7400 lots through joint venture limited liability corporations with an aggregate investment of approximately 82900 of the lots controlled by the joint ventures approximately 2800 were not under contract at december 31 2012 included in the number of controlled lots are approximately 10200 lots for which we have recorded a contract land deposit impairment reserve of approximately 65000 as of december 31 2012 further as of december 31 2012 we had approximately 68300 in land under development that once fully developed will result in approximately 700 lots for use in our homebuilding operations see note 3 and note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information regarding contract land deposits and land under development respectively 

in addition to constructing homes primarily on a presold basis and utilizing what we believe is a conservative lot acquisition strategy we focus on obtaining and maintaining a leading market position in each market we serve this strategy allows us to gain valuable efficiencies and competitive advantages in our markets which we believe contributes to minimizing the adverse effects of regional economic cycles and provides growth opportunities within these markets 

current business environment and key financial results 

throughout 2012 the homebuilding market continued to experience a stabilization in prices and improving sales trends for new homes after several years of declining home prices and sales these favorable market conditions are driven by improved affordability levels resulting from historically low mortgage interest rates and rising costs in the rental market in addition certain markets have been favorably impacted by lower inventory levels despite these improvements the housing market continues to face challenges from a tight mortgage lending environment consumer confidence issues due to sustained high levels of unemployment and uncertainty as to the longterm sustainability of the economic recovery which to this point has been uneven 

as a result of the favorable market conditions in 2012 our new orders net of cancellations “new orders” for 2012 increased 18 from the prior year while our average new order selling price of 3288 was 8 higher than the prior year consolidated revenues totaled 3184650 for 2012 an increase of 20 from 2659149 in 2011 net income for 2012 increased 40 from the prior year to 180588 diluted earnings per share in 2012 was 3512 an increase of 53 from the prior year 

  

on december 31 2012 we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of heartland homes inc the second largest homebuilder in the pittsburgh pa market the acquisition added approximately 200 units and 81600 to our backlog balance at the end of 2012 the acquisition did not impact our sales or settlements for 2012 heartland homes settled approximately 400 homes during 2012 

although there were signs in 2012 that the housing market has begun to recover we believe that continued growth in sales and prices will be reliant on a sustained overall economic recovery and higher consumer confidence levels significant economic uncertainties remain which could result in sales pricing and gross profit margin pressure over the next several quarters in addition the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act enacted on july 21 2010 contains numerous provisions affecting residential mortgages and mortgage lending practices the consumer financial protection bureau issued rules governing multiple issues in january 2013 including “ability to repay” underwriting provisions appraisal standards servicing and escrow rules and loan officer compensation requirements additional rulemaking is expected within the next couple of months the ultimate impact of such provisions on lending institutions including our mortgage banking subsidiary will depend on the banking industry’s implementation of these new standards despite these ongoing economic uncertainties we believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities that may arise due to the strength of our balance sheet 

homebuilding operations 

the following table summarizes the results of our consolidated homebuilding operations and certain operating activity for each of the last three years 

 

 consolidated homebuilding revenues 

homebuilding revenues for 2012 increased 20 from 2011 as a result of a 16 increase in the number of homes settled and a 3 increase in the average settlement price year over year the increase in the number of homes settled was attributable to an 18 increase in new orders during the first half of 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 coupled with a 26 higher beginning backlog unit balance entering 2012 as compared to 2011 these increases were offset partially by a lower backlog turnover rate in 2012 compared to 2011 average settlement prices in the current year were favorably impacted primarily by a 7 higher average sales price of new orders during the first six months of 2012 as compared to the same period in 2011 offset partially by a 4 lower average price of homes in backlog entering 2012 compared to the average price of homes in backlog entering 2011 

  

homebuilding revenues for 2011 decreased 12 from 2010 as a result of a 15 decrease in the number of homes settled offset partially by a 4 increase in the average settlement price year over year the decrease in the number of homes settled was attributable to a 17 lower beginning backlog unit balance entering 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010 coupled with lower new orders in the first half of 2011 as compared to the first half of 2010 average settlement prices in 2011 were favorably impacted by an 8 higher average price of homes in the beginning backlog entering 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 

consolidated homebuilding new orders 

new orders and the average sales price of new orders in 2012 increased 18 and 8 respectively when compared to 2011 new orders and the average new order selling prices were higher year over year in each of our market segments the increase in new orders was driven by a 5 increase in the number of active communities year over year and by improved absorption rates in many of our markets as discussed in the overview section above we believe this increase as well as the increase in the average new order selling prices is attributable to lower housing inventory improved affordability and a stabilization of housing prices in certain of our markets 

new orders in 2011 decreased 2 when compared to 2010 while the average sales price of new orders remained flat year over year during 2011 we continued to face selling pressure in most of our markets due to continuing economic uncertainty driven by low consumer confidence and high unemployment rates 

consolidated homebuilding gross profit 

gross profit margins in 2012 increased to 175 from 171 in 2011 margins were favorably impacted in 2012 by a 2000 recovery of contract land deposits previously determined to be uncollectible compared to an 11200 contract land deposit impairment charge in 2011 in addition the aforementioned increased settlement volume and higher average settlement prices in 2012 allowed us to better leverage certain operating costs however this favorable impact was offset by higher construction lumber and certain other commodity costs year over year 

gross profit margins in 2011 declined to 171 from 182 in 2010 gross profit margins in 2011 were negatively impacted by pricing pressure and increased construction and sales incentive costs driven by challenging market conditions in 2011 

consolidated homebuilding selling general and administrative “sga” 

sga expenses in 2012 increased approximately 36900 or 14 compared to 2011 but as a percentage of revenue decreased to 97 in 2012 from 101 in the prior year the increase in sga expense was attributable to an increase of approximately 19700 in management incentive costs driven by our improved financial results in addition personnel costs and sales and marketing costs were approximately 9400 and 6400 higher respectively in the current year due primarily to the 5 increase in the number of active communities year over year sga expenses decreased as a percentage of revenue due to the aforementioned 20 increase in revenues year over year 

sga expenses in 2011 increased approximately 6900 or 3 compared to 2010 and as a percentage of revenue increased to 101 in 2011 from 86 in the prior year the increase in sga expenses was primarily attributable to an approximate 10500 increase in equitybased compensation costs in 2011 compared to 2010 the increase in equitybased compensation resulted primarily from the favorable impact in 2010 of a reversal of approximately 6600 in equitybased compensation expense related to an adjustment of our stock option forfeiture estimates to our actual forfeiture experience while there was no forfeiture adjustment recorded in 2011 in addition the increase in equitybased compensation expense in 2011 resulted from incurring a full year of expense in 2011 for nonqualified stock options and restricted share units granted in the second quarter of 2010 under the 2010 equity incentive plan this increase in sga expenses was partially offset by an approximate 4100 decrease in personnel costs primarily driven by a 7800 decline in management incentives year over year sga expenses increased as a percentage of revenue due to the aforementioned 12 decrease in revenues year over year 

  

consolidated homebuilding backlog 

backlog units and dollars increased approximately 35 to 4979 and 49 to 1723914 respectively as of december 31 2012 compared to 3676 and 1160879 as of december 31 2011 the increase in backlog units was primarily attributable to new orders being approximately 800 units higher for the six month period ended december 31 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 coupled with a slower backlog turnover rate in 2012 in addition as mentioned in the overview section above the december 31 2012 acquisition of heartland homes added approximately 200 units and 81600 to our current yearend backlog the increase in backlog dollars is attributable to the increase in units and to a 9 higher average selling price for new orders for the six month period ended december 31 2012 

backlog which represents homes sold but not yet settled with the customer may be impacted by customer cancellations for various reasons that are beyond our control such as failure to obtain mortgage financing inability to sell an existing home job loss or a variety of other reasons in any period a portion of the cancellations that we experience are related to new sales that occurred during the same period and a portion are related to sales that occurred in prior periods and therefore appeared in the opening backlog for the current period expressed as the total of all cancellations during the period as a percentage of gross sales during the period our cancellation rate was 145 136 and 138 in each of 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively during each of 2012 2011 and 2010 approximately 6 of a reporting quarter’s opening backlog cancelled during the fiscal quarter we can provide no assurance that our historical cancellation rates are indicative of the actual cancellation rate that may occur in future periods see “risk factors” in item 1a of this report 

backlog units and dollars increased approximately 26 to 3676 and 21 to 1160879 respectively as of december 31 2011 compared to 2916 and 958287 as of december 31 2010 the increase in backlog units was primarily attributable to the decreased settlement activity in 2011 backlog dollars were favorably impacted by the backlog unit increase offset partially by a 4 decline in the average price of homes in backlog in 2011 compared to 2010 

reportable homebuilding segments 

homebuilding profit before tax includes all revenues and income generated from the sale of homes less the cost of homes sold sga expenses and a corporate capital allocation charge determined at the corporate headquarters the corporate capital allocation charge eliminates in consolidation is based on the segment’s average net assets employed and is charged using a consistent methodology in the years presented the corporate capital allocation charged to the operating segment allows the chief operating decision maker to determine whether the operating segment’s results are providing the desired rate of return after covering our cost of capital we record charges on contract land deposits when we determine that it is probable that recovery of the deposit is impaired for segment reporting purposes impairments on contract land deposits are generally charged to the operating segment upon the determination to terminate a finished lot purchase agreement with the developer or to restructure a lot purchase agreement resulting in the forfeiture of the deposit we evaluate our entire net contract land deposit portfolio for impairment each quarter for additional information regarding our contract land deposit impairment analysis see the critical accounting policies section within this management discussion and analysis for presentation purposes below the contract land deposit reserve at december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively has been allocated to the reportable segments to show contract land deposits on a net basis the net contract land deposit balances below also includes approximately 3300 3200 and 6600 at december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively of letters of credit issued as deposits in lieu of cash the following tables summarize certain homebuilding operating activity by reportable segment for each of the last three years

mid atlantic 

2012 versus 2011 

the mid atlantic segment had an approximate 40700 or 27 increase in segment profit in 2012 compared to 2011 the increase in segment profit was driven by the increase of approximately 295100 or 19 in revenues year over year due primarily to a 19 increase in the number of units settled the increase in units settled was attributable to a 26 increase in new orders during the first half of 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 coupled with a 24 higher backlog unit balance entering 2012 compared to the backlog unit balance entering 2011 these increases were partially offset by a slower backlog turnover rate in 2012 compared to 2011 the mid atlantic segment’s gross profit margin percentage increased to 184 in 2012 from 181 in 2011 primarily due to a 40 basis point decrease in contract land deposit impairment charges year over year the favorable impact of the increased settlement volume in 2012 which allowed us to better leverage certain operating costs was offset by higher construction lumber and certain other commodity costs year over year 

segment new orders and the average selling price increased 25 and 5 respectively in 2012 compared to 2011 new orders and average selling prices were higher in each of our markets within the mid atlantic segment new orders increased due to a 6 increase in the number of active communities and higher sales absorption driven by improved market conditions as discussed in the overview section 

2011 versus 2010 

the mid atlantic segment had an approximate 61100 or 29 decrease in segment profit in 2011 compared to 2010 revenues decreased approximately 197700 or 11 in 2011 from 2010 on a 16 decrease in the number of units settled offset partially by a 6 increase in the average settlement price year over year the decrease in the number of homes settled was attributable to a 14 lower beginning backlog unit balance entering 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010 coupled with a 12 decline in new orders in the first half of 2011 compared to the first half of 2010 average settlement prices in the current year were favorably impacted by a 10 higher average price of homes in the beginning backlog entering 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 the segment’s gross profit margin percentage decreased to 181 in 2011 from 190 in 2010 segment profit and gross profit margins were negatively impacted by pricing pressure and increased construction and sales incentive costs in addition to the reduced settlement volume year over year and its impact on our ability to leverage certain operating costs 

segment new orders in 2011 declined approximately 3 from 2010 while the average sales price of new orders in 2011 remained flat year over year new orders were lower despite a 10 increase in the number of active communities year over year due to a homebuilding environment that remained challenging throughout 2011 impacted by a sluggish economic recovery and high unemployment rates which weighed on consumer confidence and in turn suppressed housing demand new orders were also negatively impacted by an increase in the cancellation rate to 133 in 2011 from 113 in 2010 

north east 

2012 versus 2011 

the north east segment had an approximate 8100 or 60 increase in segment profit in 2012 compared to 2011 the increase in segment profit was primarily driven by an increase of approximately 57600 or 26 in revenues year over year due to a 22 increase in the number of units settled and a 3 increase in the average settlement price the increase in units settled was attributable to a 62 higher backlog unit balance entering 2012 compared to the backlog unit balance entering 2011 coupled with an 8 increase in new orders during the first half of 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 these increases were partially offset by a slower backlog turnover rate in 2012 compared to 2011 the increase in the average settlement price in 2012 is primarily attributable to a 9 increase in the average new order price for the first six months of 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 due to a product mix shift from our attached products to our detached products which 

  

generally sell at higher price points this increase was partially offset by a 4 lower average price of homes in backlog entering 2012 compared to the average price of homes in backlog entering 2011 the north east segment’s gross profit margin percentage increased approximately 50 basis points in 2012 compared to 2011 segment profit and gross profit margins were favorably impacted by the previously mentioned higher average settlement price year over year in addition gross profit margins were favorably impacted by the higher settlement volumes allowing us to better leverage certain operating costs in the current year these favorable variances were partially offset by higher construction lumber and certain other commodity costs year over year 

segment new orders and the average selling price each increased approximately 8 in 2012 compared to 2011 new orders were favorably impacted by the improved market conditions discussed in the overview section above and by a 12 increase in the number of active communities year over year this favorable impact was partially offset by an increase in the cancellation rate in the north east segment to 168 in 2012 from 131 in the prior year the increase in the average selling price is attributable to a product mix shift away from our attached products to our detached products which generally sell at higher price points 

2011 versus 2010 

the north east segment had an approximate 11600 or 46 decrease in segment profit in 2011 compared to 2010 revenues decreased approximately 66400 or 23 in 2011 from 2010 the decrease in revenues was primarily due to a 21 decrease in the number of units settled which was attributable to a 29 lower backlog unit balance entering 2011 as compared to the backlog unit balance entering 2010 in addition settlements were negatively impacted by a slower backlog turnover rate in 2011 compared to 2010 gross profit margins remained relatively flat period over period as lower contract land deposit impairment charges in 2011 of 818 or 37 basis points compared to 2010 of 4898 or 170 basis points were offset by pricing pressure and increased construction and sales incentive costs year over year in addition gross profit margins and segment profit were negatively affected by the lower settlement volume year over year which impacted our ability to leverage certain operating costs 

segment new orders in 2011 increased 5 compared to 2010 while the average sales price of new orders decreased 5 year over year new orders were favorably impacted by the increase in the number of active communities year over year average selling prices were lower year over year due to a product mix shift from our detached product to our attached product which generally sells at lower price points 

mid east 

2012 versus 2011 

the mid east segment had an approximate 12700 or 47 increase in segment profit in 2012 compared to 2011 due primarily to an increase in revenues of approximately 81000 or 15 year over year revenues increased due to a 6 increase in the number of units settled and a 9 increase in the average price of settlements in the current year compared to 2011 the increase in units settled was attributable to an 11 higher backlog unit balance entering 2012 compared to the backlog unit balance entering 2011 coupled with a 7 increase in new orders during the first half of 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 these increases were partially offset by a slower backlog turnover rate in 2012 compared to 2011 average settlement prices were favorably impacted by an 11 increase in the average new order price for the first six months of 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 due to a shift in mix to higher priced communities in certain markets gross profit margins increased approximately 80 basis points year over year primarily as a result of the increase in the average settlement price as well as from the increase in the number of settlements allowing us to better leverage certain operating costs in the current year these favorable variances were partially offset by higher construction lumber and certain other commodity costs year over year 

segment new orders and the average selling price for new orders increased 9 and 11 respectively in 2012 compared to 2011 new orders were favorably impacted by the improved market conditions discussed in the overview section above which contributed in part to higher sales absorption levels the increase in the average selling price was attributable to a shift in mix to higher priced communities in certain markets 

  

the increases to the mid east segment’s backlog sold and unsold inventory lots controlled and contract land deposit balances were all in part driven by the aforementioned december 31 2012 acquisition of heartland homes the acquisition did not impact sales or settlement results in 2012 

2011 versus 2010 

the mid east segment had an approximate 29700 or 52 decrease in segment profit in 2011 compared to 2010 driven by a decrease in revenues of approximately 83000 or 13 year over year the decline in revenues was primarily due to a 19 decrease in the number of units settled offset partially by a 7 increase in the average price of homes settled year over year units settled in 2011 were negatively impacted by a 24 lower beginning backlog unit balance entering 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 coupled with a 15 decline in new orders in the first half of 2011 compared to the first half of 2010 the increase in the average settlement price in 2011 is attributable to a 4 higher average price of homes in the beginning backlog year over year and an 8 higher average price of new orders in the first half of 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 gross profit margins declined to 155 in 2011 from 173 in 2010 gross profit margins and segment profit were negatively impacted by pricing pressure and increased construction and sales incentive costs year over year and by the lower settlement volume year over year which impacted our ability to leverage certain operating costs 

segment new orders in 2011 decreased 9 compared to 2010 while the average new order selling price increased 8 year over year new orders were lower year over year due to a homebuilding environment that remained challenging throughout 2011 impacted by a sluggish economic recovery and high unemployment rates which weighed on consumer confidence and in turn suppressed housing demand in addition new orders were negatively impacted by a lower number of active communities in certain of our markets year over year most notably the ohio and new york regions which were down 10 and 11 respectively the increase in the average selling price is attributable to a shift in mix to higher priced communities in certain markets 

south east 

2012 versus 2011 

the south east segment had an approximate 6500 or 46 increase in segment profit in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to an increase in revenues of approximately 76400 or 30 year over year segment revenues were higher primarily due to a 21 increase in the number of homes settled and a 7 increase in the average settlement price year over year the increase in settlements was attributable to a 45 higher beginning backlog unit balance entering 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 coupled with a 23 increase in new orders during the first half of 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 these increases were partially offset by a slower backlog turnover rate in 2012 compared to 2011 average settlement prices were favorably impacted by a 12 increase in the average new order price for the first six months of 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 attributable to a shift in mix to higher priced markets and higher priced communities in certain markets the south east segment’s gross profit margins in 2012 increased approximately 40 basis points from 2011 primarily due to the higher average settlement prices and improved operating leverage attributable to higher settlement volume year over year these favorable variances were partially offset by higher construction lumber and certain other commodity costs year over year 

segment new orders and the average selling price for new orders increased approximately 21 and 12 respectively in 2012 compared to 2011 new orders were favorably impacted in the current year by a 12 increase in the number of active communities and by the improved market conditions discussed in the overview section above which contributed in part to higher sales absorption levels the increase in the average selling price for new orders was attributable to a shift in mix to higher priced markets and higher priced communities in certain markets 

  

2011 versus 2010 

the south east segment had an approximate 3300 or 30 increase in segment profit in 2011 compared to 2010 despite an 8 decrease in revenues year over year the number of units settled remained flat year over year while the average price of homes settled in 2011 decreased 9 compared to 2010 the decrease in the average settlement price in 2011 is attributable to the 7 lower average price of units in backlog entering 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 gross profit margins increased to 163 in 2011 from 147 in 2010 due primarily to lower contract land deposit impairment charges in 2011 of 311 or 12 basis points compared to 4618 or 165 basis points in 2010 despite this gross profit margin improvement year over year the south east segment’s gross profit margins similar to our other segments were negatively impacted by pricing pressure and increased construction and sales incentive costs year over year 

segment new orders increased 16 in 2011 compared to 2010 while the average selling price of new orders decreased 6 year over year the increase in new orders is primarily attributable to an increase in the number of active communities in the raleigh nc and orlando fl markets in addition new orders were favorably impacted by a decline in the cancellation rate in the south east segment to 13 in 2011 from 19 in 2010 the decrease in the average selling price is attributable to product mix shift to lower priced more affordable homes in certain of our markets in the south east segment 

homebuilding segment reconciliations to consolidated homebuilding operations 

in addition to the corporate capital allocation and contract land deposit impairments discussed above the other reconciling items between homebuilding segment profit and homebuilding consolidated profit before tax include unallocated corporate overhead which includes all management incentive compensation stockbased compensation expense consolidation adjustments and external corporate interest expense our overhead functions such as accounting treasury human resources etc are centrally performed and the costs are not allocated to our operating segments consolidation adjustments consist of such items to convert the reportable segments’ results which are predominantly maintained on a cash basis to a full accrual basis for external financial statement presentation purposes and are not allocated to our operating segments likewise stockbased compensation expense is not charged to the operating segments external corporate interest expense is primarily comprised of interest charges on our senior notes and is not charged to the operating segments because the charges are included in the corporate capital allocation discussed above 

 

   

  

    

  

  mortgage banking segment 

we conduct our mortgage banking activity through nvr mortgage finance inc “nvrm” a wholly owned subsidiary nvrm focuses almost exclusively on serving the homebuilding segment’s customer base following is a table of financial and statistical data for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 

  

 2012 versus 2011 

loan closing volume for the year ended december 31 2012 increased 18 from 2011 the 2012 increase was primarily attributable to a 14 increase in the number of units closed and a 3 increase in the average loan amount year over year the increase in the number of units closed and the increase in the average loan amount are primarily attributable to the aforementioned increase in the homebuilding segment’s number of units settled and the increase in the average settlement prices in 2012 compared to 2011 

segment profit for the year ended december 31 2012 increased approximately 12000 from 2011 the increase in segment profit was primarily attributable to an approximate 15500 increase in mortgage banking fees partially offset by an approximate 2700 increase in general and administrative expenses the increase in mortgage banking fees was partially attributable to the aforementioned 18 increase in closed loan volume and an increase in secondary marketing fees the increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to an increase in compensation costs as a result of a 33 increase in headcount compared to 2011 due to increased loan volume and the increased regulatory requirements the increase in compensation costs was partially offset by an approximate 3700 decrease in the provision for loan loss compared to 2011 

2011 versus 2010 

loan closing volume for the year ended december 31 2011 decreased 16 from 2010 the 2011 decrease was primarily attributable to an 18 decrease in the number of units closed partially offset by a 3 increase in the average loan amount year over year the decrease in the number of units closed and the increase in the average loan amount are primarily attributable to the decrease in the homebuilding segment’s number of units settled and the increase in the average settlement prices in 2011 compared to 2010 the decrease in the number of units closed was also partially attributable to a 2 percentage point decrease in the number of loans closed by nvrm for our homebuyers who obtain a mortgage to purchase the home “capture rate” which decreased to 88 compared to 90 in 2010 

segment profit for the year ended december 31 2011 decreased approximately 9600 from 2010 the decrease in segment profit was primarily attributable to an approximate 13200 decrease in mortgage banking fees partially offset by an approximate 3350 decrease in general and administrative expenses the decrease in 

  

mortgage banking fees was primarily attributable to the 16 decrease in closed loan volume in 2011 compared to 2012 the decrease in general and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to an approximate 1200 decrease in the provision for loan loss and an approximate 1500 decrease in management incentive compensation compared to 2010 

mortgage banking—other 

we sell all of the loans we originate into the secondary mortgage market insofar as we underwrite our originated loans to the standards and specifications of the ultimate investor we have no further financial obligations from the issuance of loans except in certain limited instances where early payment default occurs those underwriting standards are typically equal to or more stringent than the underwriting standards required by fnma va and fha because we sell all of our loans and do not service them there is often a substantial delay between the time that a loan goes into default and the time that the investor requests us to reimburse them for losses incurred because of the default we believe that all of the loans that we originate are underwritten to the standards and specifications of the ultimate investor to whom we sell our originated loans we employ a quality control department to ensure that our underwriting controls are effective and further assess the underwriting function as part of our assessment of internal controls over financial reporting 

nvrm has always maintained an allowance for losses on mortgage loans originated that reflects our judgment of the present loss exposure from the loans that we have originated and sold the allowance is calculated based on an analysis of historical experience and exposure during the third quarter of 2012 nvrm entered into a settlement agreement with one of its correspondent lenders to pay 7250 to settle all pending and future repayment and settlement requests for all loans delivered to that correspondent lender this lender represented 59 of nvrm’s loan closing volume from january 1 2005 through december 31 2011 the settlement payment reduced the loan loss allowance which is included in the mortgage banking segment’s “accounts payable and other liabilities” line item on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2012 we had an allowance for loan losses of approximately 6550 although we consider the allowance for loan losses reflected on the december 31 2012 balance sheet to be adequate there can be no assurance that this allowance will prove to be adequate to cover losses on loans previously originated 

in october 2011 bank of america discontinued their correspondent lending program as a result this decreased the number of investors available in the loan sale distribution channels the remaining correspondent investors are now dealing with a larger volume of loans and as a result of changes in the regulatory environment are performing a much more comprehensive review of loan files prior to purchase this resulted in loans originated by us remaining in inventory for a longer period of time before being sold compared to our historical averages prior to bank of america discontinuing their correspondent lending program loans were typically sold within 30 days this time period increased to 30 to 60 days during the fourth quarter of 2011 and into the first quarter of 2012 during 2012 we have experienced improvement in investor funding times consistent with our historical averages resulting in our mortgages held for sale balance included in the consolidated balance sheet decreasing by approximately 63400 from december 31 2011 we can make no assurances that our average days in inventory will remain below 30 days in future periods 

nvrm is dependent on our homebuilding segment’s customers for business if new orders and selling prices of the homebuilding segment decline nvrm’s operations will also be adversely affected in addition the mortgage segment’s operating results may be adversely affected in future periods due to the continued tightening and volatility of the credit markets changes in investor funding times as well as increased regulation of mortgage lending practices 

seasonality 

overall we do not experience material seasonal fluctuations in sales settlements or loan closings 

  

effective tax rate 

our consolidated effective tax rate in 2012 2011 and 2010 was 3435 3765 and 3610 respectively during 2012 we reduced our provision for unrecognized tax benefits by 9154 which reduced the 2012 effective tax rate the reduction resulted from settlements with and an audit by certain taxing authorities during 2012 which led us to update our evaluation of the administrative practice in other states for similar uncertain tax positions to determine whether the positions taken in those states were effectively settled see note 9 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements herein for further discussion of income taxes 

recent accounting pronouncements pending adoption 

there have not been any pronouncements issued but not yet implemented that we believe will have a material impact on our financial statements 

liquidity and capital resources 

lines of credit and notes payable 

our homebuilding business segment funds its operations from cash flows provided by operating activities and the public debt and equity markets on september 5 2012 we filed a shelf registration statement the “shelf” with the securities and exchange commission to register for future offer and sale an unlimited amount of debt securities common shares preferred shares depositary shares representing preferred shares and warrants on september 10 2012 we issued 600000 aggregate principal amount of 395 senior notes due 2022 the “notes” under the shelf the notes were issued at a discount to yield 397 and have been reflected net of the unamortized discount in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet the offering of the notes resulted in aggregate net proceeds of approximately 593900 after deducting offering expenses the notes mature on september 15 2022 and bear interest at 395 payable semiannually in arrears on march 15 and september 15 commencing on march 15 2013 the notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with any of nvr’s existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness will rank senior in right of payment to any of nvr’s future indebtedness that is by its terms expressly subordinated to the notes and will be effectively subordinated to any of nvr’s existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness the indenture governing the notes does not contain any financial covenants however it does contain among other items and subject to certain exceptions covenants that restrict the company’s ability to create incur assume or guarantee secured debt enter into sale and leaseback transactions and conditions related to mergers andor the sale of assets the proceeds from the notes issuance are intended to be used for general corporate purposes which may include repurchases of our common shares 

our mortgage subsidiary nvrm provides for its mortgage origination and other operating activities using cash generated from operations borrowings from its parent company nvr as well as a revolving mortgage repurchase facility which is nonrecourse to nvr on august 1 2012 nvrm entered into a repurchase agreement with us bank national association which provides for loan purchases up to 25000 subject to certain sublimits “repurchase agreement” the purpose of the repurchase agreement is to finance the origination of mortgage loans by nvrm the repurchase agreement expires on july 31 2013 

advances under the repurchase agreement carry a pricing rate based on the libor rate plus the libor margin or the default pricing rate as determined under the repurchase agreement provided that the pricing rate shall not be less than 310 there are several restrictions on purchased loans including that they cannot be sold to others they cannot be pledged to anyone other than the agent and they cannot support any other borrowing or repurchase agreement the repurchase agreement contains various affirmative and negative covenants the negative covenants include among others certain limitations on transactions involving acquisitions mergers the incurrence of debt sale of assets and creation of liens upon any of its mortgage notes additional covenants include i a tangible net worth requirement ii a minimum liquidity requirement iii a minimum net income requirement and iv a maximum leverage ratio requirement the company was in compliance with all covenants under the repurchase agreement at december 31 2012 at december 31 2012 there was no debt outstanding under the repurchase agreement and there were no borrowing base limitations 

  

equity repurchases 

in addition to funding growth in our homebuilding and mortgage banking operations we historically have used a substantial portion of our excess liquidity to repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock in open market and privately negotiated transactions this ongoing repurchase activity is conducted pursuant to publicly announced board authorizations and is typically executed in accordance with the safeharbor provisions of rule 10b18 promulgated under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended in addition the board resolutions authorizing us to repurchase shares of our common stock specifically prohibit us from purchasing shares from our officers directors profit sharing401k plan trust or employee stock ownership plan trust the repurchase program assists us in accomplishing our primary objective creating increases in shareholder value see part ii item 5 of this form 10k for disclosure of amounts repurchased during the fourth quarter of 2012 for the year ended december 31 2012 we repurchased 285495 shares of our common stock at an aggregate purchase price of approximately 227300 as of december 31 2012 we had approximately 392600 available under two board approved repurchase authorizations 

cash flows 

for the year ended december 31 2012 cash and cash equivalents increased by 672713 net cash provided by operating activities was 264384 cash was provided by homebuilding operations and by an approximate 63400 decrease in mortgage loans held for sale in addition cash was provided by an increase of 110396 in accounts payable accrued expenses and customer deposits in 2012 compared to 2011 payables were higher due primarily to an increase in our inventory levels the increase in accrued expenses and customer deposits were attributable to increased management incentive accruals associated with our improved financial results and an increase in customer deposits associated with increased sales volume cash provided by homebuilding operations was used to fund the increase to homebuilding inventory of 97750 as a result of an increase in the units under construction at the end of 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 in addition cash was used to fund the 53942 increase in contract land deposits year over year investing activities during 2012 used net cash of 22611 primarily as a result of the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of heartland homes on december 31 2012 see note 14 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included herein for additional discussion of the acquisition in addition cash was used for the purchase of property plant and equipment totaling 12365 during 2012 these uses of cash from investing activities were partially offset by capital distributions received from our unconsolidated joint ventures net cash provided by financing activities was 430940 due primarily to the receipt of 593866 in net proceeds from the issuance of the notes and 73211 in proceeds from stock option exercises during 2012 we spent 227281 to repurchase 285495 shares of our common stock under our ongoing common stock repurchase program as discussed above in addition cash was used in the repayment of 21910 of loans assumed in the acquisition of heartland homes 

for the year ended december 31 2011 cash and cash equivalents decreased by 712956 net cash provided by operating activities was 1463 cash provided by homebuilding operations was used to fund the increase to homebuilding inventory of 99527 as a result of an increase in the units under construction at the end of 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 in addition cash was used to fund the 42385 increase in contract land deposits year over year the presentation of operating cash flows was reduced by 22835 which is the amount of the excess tax benefit realized from stock option exercises and deferred compensation plan distributions during 2011 and credited directly to additional paid in capital investing activities during 2011 used net cash of 61866 primarily as a result of our investment in a joint venture with morgan stanley real estate investing of 61250 in addition cash was used to purchase 11444 in property plant and equipment during 2011 these uses of cash from investing activities were partially offset by capital distributions received from our unconsolidated joint ventures net cash used by financing activities was 652553 during 2011 we spent approximately 689300 to repurchase 1017588 shares of our common stock under our ongoing common stock repurchase program as discussed above in addition cash was used in the repayment of approximately 90000 of the outstanding nvrm repurchase facility due to our decision to substantially reduce the available credit capacity under the repurchase agreement these uses of cash from financing activities were offset partially by equitybased activity which provided stock option exercise proceeds of 106999 and the realization of 22835 in excess income tax benefits from stock option exercises and deferred compensation plan distributions 

  

for the year ended december 31 2010 cash and cash equivalents decreased by 56400 net cash provided by operating activities was 55388 cash was provided primarily by homebuilding operations and was used to fund increases to contract land deposits the presentation of operating cash flows was reduced by 63558 which is the amount of the excess tax benefit realized from stock option exercises and deferred compensation plan distributions during 2010 and credited directly to additional paid in capital investing activities provided net cash of 212440 primarily due to the net redemption of 219535 in marketable securities at maturity during the year net cash used by financing activities was 324228 during 2010 we repurchased 644562 shares of our common stock at an aggregate purchase price of 417079 under our ongoing common stock repurchase program in addition we redeemed the remaining outstanding 5 senior notes due 2010 totaling 133370 upon their maturity on june 15 2010 stock option exercise activity during 2010 provided 77492 in exercise proceeds and we realized 63558 in excess income tax benefits from the exercise of stock options and deferred compensation plan distributions we also increased net borrowings under the mortgage warehouse facility by 77579 due to a change in the distribution channel for the sale of mortgage loans closed 

at december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 the homebuilding segment had restricted cash of approximately 19661 19119 and 22889 respectively which is included in “other assets” on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets the restricted cash balances relate to holding requirements for outstanding letters of credit issued under our letter of credit agreement in addition restricted cash relates to customer deposits for certain home sales 

we believe that our current cash holdings cash generated from operations and borrowings available under our mortgage repurchase agreement and the public debt and equity markets will be sufficient to satisfy near and long term cash requirements for working capital and debt service in both our homebuilding and mortgage banking operations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

lot acquisition strategy 

we generally do not engage in land development instead we typically acquire finished building lots at market prices from various land developers under fixed price purchase agreements that require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the agreement the deposits required under the purchase agreements are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percentage typically ranging up to 10 of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots 

we believe that our lot acquisition strategy reduces the financial requirements and risks associated with direct land ownership and land development we may at our option choose for any reason and at any time not to perform under these purchase agreements by delivering notice of our intent not to acquire the finished lots under contract our sole legal obligation and economic loss for failure to perform under these purchase agreements is limited to the amount of the deposit pursuant to the liquidated damage provision contained within the purchase agreements we do not have any financial guarantees or completion obligations and we typically do not guarantee lot purchases on a specific performance basis under these purchase agreements 

at december 31 2012 we controlled approximately 58500 lots through lot purchase agreements joint ventures and land under development with an aggregate purchase price of approximately 5100000 these lots are controlled by making or committing to make deposits of approximately 308900 in the form of cash and letters of credit our entire risk of loss pertaining to the aggregate purchase price contractual commitment resulting from our nonperformance under the contracts is limited to our 259900 deposit paid plus the additional 49000 referred to below of the 308900 deposit total approximately 256600 was in cash and approximately 3300 was in letters of credit which had been issued as of december 31 2012 the remaining balance of approximately 49000 relates to deposits to be paid subsequent to december 31 2012 assuming that contractual development milestones are met by the developers see contractual obligations section below as of december 31 2012 we had recorded an impairment valuation allowance of approximately 65000 related to certain cash deposits currently outstanding please refer to note 1 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of the contract land deposits and note 3 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of our lot acquisition strategy in relation to our accounting related to the consolidation of variable interest entities  

  

bonds and letters of credit 

we enter into bond or letter of credit arrangements with local municipalities government agencies or land developers to collateralize our obligations under various contracts we had approximately 47100 of contingent obligations under such agreements as of december 31 2012 inclusive of the 3300 of lot acquisition deposits in the form of letters of credit discussed above we believe we will fulfill our obligations under the related contracts and do not anticipate any material losses under these bonds or letters of credit 

mortgage commitments and forward sales 

in the normal course of business our mortgage banking segment enters into contractual commitments to extend credit to buyers of singlefamily homes with fixed expiration dates the commitments become effective when the borrowers “lockin” a specified interest rate within time frames established by us all mortgagors are evaluated for credit worthiness prior to the extension of the commitment market risk arises if interest rates move adversely between the time of the “lockin” of rates by the borrower and the sale date of the loan to a brokerdealer to mitigate the effect of the interest rate risk inherent in providing rate lock commitments to borrowers we enter into optional or mandatory delivery forward sale contracts to sell whole loans and mortgagebacked securities to brokerdealers the forward sale contracts lock in an interest rate and price for the sale of loans similar to the specific rate lock commitments we do not engage in speculative or trading derivative activities both the rate lock commitments to borrowers and the forward sale contracts to brokerdealers are undesignated derivatives and accordingly are marked to fair value through earnings at december 31 2012 there were contractual commitments to extend credit to borrowers aggregating 138865 and open forward delivery contracts aggregating 305322 please refer to note 12 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of our fair value accounting 

contractual obligations 

our fixed noncancelable obligations as of december 31 2012 were as follows 

 

  

     

    critical accounting policies 

general 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods we continually evaluate the estimates we use to prepare the consolidated financial statements and update those estimates as necessary in general our estimates are based on historical experience on information from third party professionals and other various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances actual results could differ materially from those estimates made by management 

homebuilding inventory 

the carrying value of inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market value cost of lots and completed and uncompleted housing units represent the accumulated actual cost of the units field construction supervisors’ salaries and related direct overhead expenses are included in inventory costs interest costs are not capitalized into inventory with the exception of land under development upon settlement the cost of the unit is expensed on a specific identification basis cost of manufacturing materials is determined on a firstin firstout basis 

sold inventory is evaluated for impairment based on the contractual selling price compared to the total estimated cost to construct unsold inventory is evaluated for impairment by analyzing recent comparable sales prices within the applicable community compared to the costs incurred to date plus the expected costs to complete any calculated impairments are recorded immediately 

  

land under development and contract land deposits 

land under development 

on a very limited basis we directly acquire raw parcels of land already zoned for its intended use to develop into finished lots land under development includes the land acquisition costs direct improvement costs capitalized interest where applicable and real estate taxes 

land under development including the land under development held by our unconsolidated joint ventures and the related joint venture investments is reviewed for potential writedowns when impairment indicators are present in addition to considering market and economic conditions we assess land under development impairments on a communitybycommunity basis analyzing as applicable current sales absorption levels recent sales’ gross profit and the dollar differential between the projected fullydeveloped cost of the lots and the current market price for lots if indicators of impairment are present for a community we perform an analysis to determine if the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts and if they are impairment charges are required to be recorded in an amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets our determination of fair value is primarily based on discounting the estimated future cash flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams 

at december 31 2012 we had approximately 68300 in land under development in three separate communities in addition at december 31 2012 we had an aggregate investment totaling approximately 82900 in four separate jvs that controlled land under development none of the three communities classified as land under development nor any of the undeveloped land held by the four jvs had any indicators of impairment at december 31 2012 as such we do not believe that any of the land under development is impaired at this time however there can be no assurance that we will not incur impairment charges in the future due to unanticipated adverse changes in the economy or other events adversely affecting specific markets or the homebuilding industry 

contract land deposits 

we purchase finished lots under fixed price purchase agreements that require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the contract the deposits are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percentage of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots 

we maintain an allowance for losses on contract land deposits that reflects our judgment of the present loss exposure in the existing contract land deposit portfolio at the end of the reporting period to analyze contract land deposit impairments we utilize a loss contingency analysis that is conducted each quarter in addition to considering market and economic conditions we assess contract land deposit impairments on a communitybycommunity basis pursuant to the purchase contract terms analyzing as applicable current sales absorption levels recent sales’ gross profit the dollar differential between the contractual purchase price and the current market price for lots a developer’s financial stability a developer’s financial ability or willingness to reduce lot prices to current market prices and the contract’s default status by either us or the developer along with an analysis of the expected outcome of any such default 

our analysis is focused on whether we can sell houses profitably in a particular community in the current market with which we are faced because we don’t own the finished lots on which we had placed a contract land deposit if the above analysis leads to a determination that we can’t sell homes profitably at the current contractual lot price we then determine whether we will elect to default under the contract forfeit our deposit and terminate the contract or whether we will attempt to restructure the lot purchase contract which may require us to forfeit the deposit to obtain contract concessions from a developer we also assess whether an impairment is present due to collectability issues resulting from a developer’s nonperformance because of financial or other conditions 

  

although we consider the allowance for losses on contract land deposits reflected on the december 31 2012 consolidated balance sheet to be adequate see note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included herein there can be no assurance that this allowance will prove to be adequate over time to cover losses due to unanticipated adverse changes in the economy or other events adversely affecting specific markets or the homebuilding industry 

excess reorganization value 

reorganization value in excess of identifiable assets “excess reorganization value” is an indefinitelived intangible asset that was created upon our emergence from bankruptcy on september 30 1993 based on the allocation of our reorganization value the portion of our reorganization value which was not attributed to specific tangible or intangible assets has been reported as excess reorganization value which is treated similarly to goodwill excess reorganization value is not subject to amortization rather excess reorganization value is subject to an impairment assessment on an annual basis or more frequently if changes in events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred because excess reorganization value was based on the reorganization value of our entire enterprise upon bankruptcy emergence the impairment assessment is conducted on an enterprise basis based on the comparison of our total equity compared to the market value of our outstanding publiclytraded common stock we do not believe that excess reorganization value is impaired at this time however changes in strategy or continued adverse changes in market conditions could impact this judgment and require an impairment loss to be recognized if our book value including excess reorganization value exceeds the fair value 

warranty  product liability accruals 

warranty and product liability accruals are established to provide for estimated future costs as a result of construction and product defects product recalls and litigation incidental to our business liability estimates are determined based on our judgment considering such factors as historical experience the likely current cost of corrective action manufacturers’ and subcontractors’ participation in sharing the cost of corrective action consultations with third party experts such as engineers and evaluations by our general counsel and outside counsel retained to handle specific product liability cases although we consider the warranty and product liability accrual reflected on the december 31 2012 consolidated balance sheet to be adequate see note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included herein there can be no assurance that this accrual will prove to be adequate over time to cover losses due to increased costs for material and labor the inability or refusal of manufacturers or subcontractors to financially participate in corrective action unanticipated adverse legal settlements or other unanticipated changes to the assumptions used to estimate the warranty and product liability accrual 

equitybased compensation expense 

compensation costs related to our equitybased compensation plans are recognized within our income statement the costs recognized are based on the grant date fair value compensation cost for sharebased grants is recognized on a straightline basis over the requisite service period for the entire award from the date of grant through the period of the last separately vesting portion of the grant 

we calculate the fair value of our nonpublicly traded employee stock options using the blackscholes optionpricing model while the blackscholes model is a widely accepted method to calculate the fair value of options its results are dependent on input variables two of which expected term and expected volatility are significantly dependent on management’s judgment we have concluded that our historical exercise experience is the best estimate of future exercise patterns to determine an option’s expected term to estimate expected volatility we analyze the historical volatility of our common stock over a period equal to the option’s expected term changes in management’s judgment of the expected term and the expected volatility could have a material effect on the grantdate fair value calculated and expensed within the income statement in addition we are required to estimate future grant forfeitures when considering the amount of stockbased compensation costs to record we have concluded that our historical forfeiture rate is the best measure to base our estimate of future forfeitures of equitybased compensation grants however there can be no assurance that our future forfeiture rate will not be materially higher or lower than our historical forfeiture rate which would affect the aggregate cumulative compensation expense recognized 

  

mortgage loan loss allowance 

we originate several different loan products to our customers to finance the purchase of their home we sell all of the loans we originate into the secondary mortgage market generally within 30 days from origination all of the loans that we originate are underwritten to the standards and specifications of the ultimate investor insofar as we underwrite our originated loans to those standards we bear no increased concentration of credit risk from the issuance of loans except in certain limited instances where early payment default occurs those underwriting standards are typically equal to or more stringent than the underwriting standards required by fnma va and fha we employ a quality control department to ensure that our underwriting controls are effectively operating and further assess the underwriting function as part of our assessment of internal controls over financial reporting we maintain an allowance for losses on mortgage loans originated that reflects our judgment of the present loss exposure in the loans that we have originated and sold the allowance is calculated based on an analysis of historical experience and exposure although we consider the allowance for loan losses reflected on the december 31 2012 consolidated balance sheet to be adequate see note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included herein there can be no assurance that this allowance will prove to be adequate over time to cover losses due to unanticipated changes to the assumptions used to estimate the mortgage loan loss allowance 

impact of inflation changing prices and economic conditions 

see risk factors included in item 1a herein see also the discussion above under overview of current business environment 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates our market risk arises from interest rate risk inherent in our financial instruments and debt obligations interest rate risk results from the possibility that changes in interest rates will cause unfavorable changes in net income or in the value of interest ratesensitive assets liabilities and commitments lower interest rates tend to increase demand for mortgage loans for home purchasers while higher interest rates make it more difficult for potential borrowers to purchase residential properties and to qualify for mortgage loans we have no market rate sensitive instruments held for speculative or trading purposes 

our homebuilding segment is exposed to interest rate risk as it relates to its debt obligations in september 2012 we issued 600000 of 395 senior notes due 2022 the “notes” the notes mature on september 15 2022 and bear interest at 395 payable semiannually in arrears on march 15 and september 15 commencing on march 15 2013 changes to interest rates generally affect the fair value of fixedrate debt instruments but not earnings or cash flows we generally have no obligation to prepay the notes prior to maturity and thus interest rate fluctuations should not have a significant impact on our fixedrate debt 

our mortgage banking segment is exposed to interest rate risk as it relates to its lending activities the mortgage banking segment originates mortgage loans which are sold through either optional or mandatory forward delivery contracts into the secondary markets all of the mortgage banking segment’s loan portfolio is held for sale and subject to forward sale commitments nvrm also sells all of its mortgages held for sale on a servicing released basis 

nvrm has available a mortgage repurchase agreement which provides for loan repurchases up to 25000 subject to certain sub limits the repurchase agreement is used to fund nvrm’s mortgage origination activities advances under the repurchase agreement carry a pricing rate based on the libor rate plus the libor margin or the default pricing rate as determined under the repurchase agreement provided that the pricing rate shall not be less than 310 at december 31 2012 there was no debt outstanding under the repurchase agreement 

  

the following table represents the contractual balances of our onbalance sheet financial instruments at the expected maturity dates as well as the fair values of those onbalance sheet financial instruments at december 31 2012 the table does not include the debt of our consolidated joint venture as it is nonrecourse to us the expected maturity categories take into consideration the actual and anticipated amortization of principal and do not take into consideration the reinvestment of cash or the refinancing of existing indebtedness because we sell all of the mortgage loans we originate into the secondary markets we have made the assumption that the portfolio of mortgage loans held for sale will mature in the first year consequently advances outstanding under the repurchase agreement would also be assumed to mature in the first year

 item 1 business tableend general 

nvr inc “nvr” was formed in 1980 as nvhomes inc our primary business is the construction and sale of singlefamily detached homes townhomes and condominium buildings to more fully serve customers of our homebuilding operations we also operate a mortgage banking and title services business we conduct our homebuilding activities directly our mortgage banking operations are operated primarily through a wholly owned subsidiary nvr mortgage finance inc “nvrm” unless the context otherwise requires references to “nvr” “we” “us” or “our” include nvr and its consolidated subsidiaries 

we are one of the largest homebuilders in the united states while we operate in multiple locations in fifteen states primarily in the eastern part of the united states approximately 35 of our home settlements in 2011 occurred in the washington dc and baltimore md metropolitan areas which accounted for approximately 46 of our 2011 homebuilding revenues our homebuilding operations include the construction and sale of singlefamily detached homes townhomes and condominium buildings under four trade names ryan homes nvhomes fox ridge homes and rymarc homes the ryan homes fox ridge homes and rymarc homes products are marketed primarily to firsttime homeowners and firsttime moveup buyers the ryan homes product is currently sold in twentyfive metropolitan areas located in maryland virginia west virginia pennsylvania new york north carolina south carolina ohio new jersey delaware kentucky indiana illinois and florida the fox ridge homes product is sold solely in the nashville tn metropolitan area and the rymarc homes product is sold solely in the columbia sc metropolitan area the nvhomes product is marketed primarily to moveup and upscale buyers and is sold in the washington dc baltimore md philadelphia pa and the maryland eastern shore metropolitan areas in 2011 our average price of a settled unit was approximately 307500 

historically we generally have not engaged in land development see discussion below on our limited land development activities instead we typically acquire finished building lots at market prices from various development entities under fixed price purchase agreements “purchase agreements” that require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the purchase agreement the deposits required under the purchase agreements are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percentage typically ranging up to 10 of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots 

we believe that our lot acquisition strategy avoids the financial requirements and risks associated with direct land ownership and land development we may at our option choose for any reason and at any time not to perform under these purchase agreements by delivering notice of our intent not to acquire the finished lots under contract our sole legal obligation and economic loss for failure to perform under these purchase agreements is limited to the amount of the deposit pursuant to the liquidated damage provision contained within the purchase agreements we do not have any financial guarantees or completion obligations and we typically do not guarantee lot purchases on a specific performance basis under these purchase agreements none of the creditors of any of the development entities with which we have entered these purchase agreements have recourse to our general credit we generally seek to maintain control over a supply of lots believed to be suitable to meet our fiveyear business plan 

our continued success is contingent upon our ability to control an adequate supply of finished lots on which to build and on our developers’ ability to timely deliver finished lots to meet the sales demands of our customers however current economic conditions and the continued downturn of the homebuilding industry have exerted pressure on our developers’ ability to obtain acquisition and development financing or to raise equity investments to finance land development activity potentially constraining our supply of finished lots this pressure has necessitated that in certain specific strategic circumstances we deviate from our historical lot acquisition strategy and engage in joint venture arrangements with land developers or directly acquire raw ground already zoned for its intended use for development once we acquire control of any raw ground we determine 

  

whether to sell the raw parcel to a developer and enter into a fixed price purchase agreement with the developer to purchase the finished lots or whether to hire a developer to develop the land on our behalf while joint venture arrangements and direct land development activity are not our preferred method of acquiring finished building lots we may enter into additional transactions in the future on a limited basis where there exists a compelling strategic or prudent financial reason to do so we expect however to continue to acquire substantially all of our finished lot inventory using fixed price purchase agreements with forfeitable deposits 

as of december 31 2011 we controlled approximately 48200 lots under purchase agreements with deposits in cash and letters of credit totaling approximately 2023 million and 32 million respectively included in the number of controlled lots are approximately 10600 lots for which we have recorded a contract land deposit impairment reserve of approximately 703 million as of december 31 2011 in addition we had an aggregate investment totaling approximately 895 million in four separate joint venture limited liability corporations “jvs” expected to produce approximately 6700 lots of the lots controlled by the jvs approximately 2700 were not under contract at december 31 2011 further as of december 31 2011 we directly owned three separate raw parcels of land zoned for their intended use with a current cost basis including development costs of approximately 780 million that we intend to develop into approximately 800 finished lots for use in our homebuilding operations see note 3 and note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information regarding jvs and land under development respectively 

in addition to building and selling homes we provide a number of mortgagerelated services through our mortgage banking operations through operations in each of our homebuilding markets nvrm originates mortgage loans almost exclusively for our homebuyers nvrm generates revenues primarily from origination fees gains on sales of loans and title fees nvrm sells all of the mortgage loans it closes into the secondary markets on a servicing released basis 

segment information for our homebuilding and mortgage banking businesses is included in note 2 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

current business environment 

the homebuilding environment remains challenging as it continues to be impacted by the economic downturn and uncertainty that has existed in the us throughout the past six years the sluggish economy and high unemployment rates continue to weigh on consumer confidence and in turn suppress housing demand despite what have been historically low mortgage rates in 2011 new home sales also continue to be adversely impacted by a highly restrictive mortgage lending environment that has made it more difficult for our customers to obtain mortgage financing we expect to continue to see market volatility pricing pressure and reduced demand for new homes until there is economic stability and improved consumer confidence for additional information and analysis of recent trends in our operations and financial condition see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 of this form 10k 

homebuilding 

products 

we offer singlefamily detached homes townhomes and condominium buildings with many different basic home designs these home designs have a variety of elevations and numerous other options our homes combine traditional colonial or cottage exterior designs with contemporary interior designs and amenities generally include two to four bedrooms and range from approximately 1000 to 7300 square feet during 2011 the prices at which we settled homes ranged from approximately 103000 to 23 million and averaged approximately 307500 during 2010 our average price was approximately 297100 

  

markets 

our four reportable homebuilding segments operate in the following geographic regions 

 

 backlog 

backlog totaled 3676 units and approximately 12 billion at december 31 2011 compared to backlog of 2916 units and approximately 10 billion at december 31 2010 backlog which represents homes sold but not yet settled with the customer may be impacted by customer cancellations for various reasons that are beyond our control such as failure to obtain mortgage financing inability to sell an existing home job loss or a variety of other reasons in any period a portion of the cancellations that we experience are related to new sales that occurred during the same period and a portion are related to sales that occurred in prior periods and therefore appeared in the opening backlog for the current period expressed as the total of all cancellations during the period as a percentage of gross sales during the period our cancellation rate was approximately 14 in each of 2011 2010 and 2009 of a reporting quarter’s opening backlog 6 during 2011 and 2010 and 7 during 2009 of that opening backlog balance cancelled during the fiscal quarter we can provide no assurance that our historical cancellation rates are indicative of the actual cancellation rate that may occur in future periods see “risk factors” in item 1a of this form 10k 

further discussion of settlements new orders and backlog activity by homebuilding reportable segment for each of the last three years can be found in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 of this form 10k 

construction 

we utilize independent subcontractors under fixed price contracts to perform construction work on our homes we use several independent subcontractors in our various markets and we are not dependent on any single subcontractor or on a small number of subcontractors 

sales and marketing 

our preferred marketing method is for customers to visit a furnished model home featuring many builtin options and a landscaped lot the garages of these model homes are usually converted into temporary sales centers where alternative facades and floor plans are displayed and designs for other models are available for review sales representatives are compensated predominantly on a commission basis 

regulation 

we and our subcontractors must comply with various federal state and local zoning building environmental advertising and consumer credit statutes rules and regulations as well as other regulations and requirements in connection with our construction and sales activities all of these regulations have increased the cost to produce and market our products and in some instances have delayed our developers’ ability to deliver finished lots to us counties and cities in which we build homes have at times declared moratoriums on the issuance of building permits and imposed other restrictions in the areas in which sewage treatment facilities and other public facilities do not reach minimum standards to date restrictive zoning laws and the imposition of moratoriums have not had a material adverse effect on our construction activities 

  

competition and market factors 

the housing industry is highly competitive we compete with numerous homebuilders of varying size ranging from local to national in scope some of which have greater financial resources than we do we also face competition from the home resale market our homebuilding operations compete primarily on the basis of price location design quality service and reputation historically we have been one of the market leaders in each of the markets where we build homes 

the housing industry is cyclical and is affected by consumer confidence levels prevailing economic conditions and interest rates other factors that affect the housing industry and the demand for new homes include the availability and the cost of land labor and materials changes in consumer preferences demographic trends and the availability of mortgage finance programs see “risk factors” in item 1a of this form 10k 

we are dependent upon building material suppliers for a continuous flow of raw materials whenever possible we utilize standard products available from multiple sources in the past such raw materials have been generally available to us in adequate supply 

mortgage banking 

we provide a number of mortgage related services to our homebuilding customers through our mortgage banking operations our mortgage banking operations also include separate subsidiaries that broker title insurance and perform title searches in connection with mortgage loan closings for which they receive commissions and fees because nvrm originates mortgage loans almost exclusively for our homebuilding customers nvrm is dependent on our homebuilding segment in 2011 nvrm closed approximately 7000 loans with an aggregate principal amount of approximately 19 billion as compared to approximately 8600 loans with an aggregate principal amount of approximately 22 billion in 2010 

nvrm sells all of the mortgage loans it closes to investors in the secondary markets on a servicing released basis typically within 30 to 60 days from the loan closing nvrm is an approved sellerservicer for fnma mortgage loans and an approved lenderseller of gnma fhlmc va and fha mortgage loans 

competition and market factors 

nvrm’s main competition comes from national regional and local mortgage bankers mortgage brokers thrifts and banks in each of these markets nvrm competes primarily on the basis of customer service variety of products offered interest rates offered prices of ancillary services and relative financing availability and costs 

regulation 

nvrm is an approved sellerservicer of fnma mortgage loans and an approved lenderseller of gnma fhlmc va and fha mortgage loans and is subject to all of those agencies’ rules and regulations these rules and regulations restrict certain activities of nvrm nvrm is currently eligible and expects to remain eligible to participate in such programs in addition nvrm is subject to regulation at the state and federal level with respect to specific origination selling and servicing practices 

pipeline 

nvrm’s mortgage loans in process that have not closed “pipeline” at december 31 2011 and 2010 had an aggregate principal balance of approximately 790 million and 670 million respectively nvrm’s cancellation rate was approximately 29 in 2011 during 2010 and 2009 nvrm’s loan cancellation rates were approximately 29 and 35 respectively we can provide no assurance that our historical loan cancellation rates are indicative of the actual loan cancellation rate that may occur in future periods see “risk factors” in item 1a in this form 10k 

  

employees 

at december 31 2011 we employed 2765 fulltime persons of whom 1077 were officers and management personnel 182 were technical and construction personnel 619 were sales personnel 477 were administrative personnel and 410 were engaged in various other service and labor activities none of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement and we have never experienced a work stoppage we believe that our employee relations are good

our business is affected by the risks generally incident to the residential construction business including but not limited to 

 

  

  

  

  

 all of these risks are discussed in detail below 

the homebuilding industry continues to experience a significant downturn the continuation of this slowdown could adversely affect our business and our results of operations 

the homebuilding industry has continued to experience a significant downturn as a result of low consumer confidence driven by an economic recession high unemployment levels affordability issues and uncertainty as to the stability of home prices additionally the tightening credit markets have made it more difficult for customers to obtain financing to purchase homes as a result we have experienced reduced demand for new homes these ongoing market factors have also resulted in pricing pressures and in turn gross profit margin pressure in all of our markets a continued downturn in the homebuilding industry could have a material adverse effect on our sales either through fewer gross sales andor higher cancellation rates which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

if the market value of our inventory or controlled lot position declines our profit could decrease and we may incur losses 

inventory risk can be substantial for homebuilders the market value of building lots and housing inventories can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing market conditions in addition inventory carrying costs can be significant and can result in losses in a poorly performing project or market we must in the ordinary course of our business continuously seek and make acquisitions of lots for expansion into new markets as well as for replacement and expansion within our current markets which is generally accomplished by us entering fixed price purchase agreements and paying forfeitable deposits under the purchase agreement to developers for the contractual right to acquire the lots in the event of further adverse changes in economic or market conditions we may cease further building activities in communities or restructure existing purchase agreements resulting in forfeiture of some or all of any remaining land contract deposit paid to the developer either action may result in a loss which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

if the underwriting quality of our mortgage originations is found to be deficient our profit could decrease and we may incur losses 

we originate several different loan products to our customers to finance the purchase of their home we sell all of the loans we originate into the secondary mortgage market generally within 30 to 60 days from origination all of the loans that we originate are underwritten to the standards and specifications of the ultimate investor insofar as we underwrite our originated loans to those standards we bear no increased concentration of credit risk from the issuance of loans except in certain limited instances where early payment default occurs in the event that a substantial number of the loans that we have originated fall into default and the investors to whom we sold the loan determine that we did not underwrite the loan in accordance with their requirements we could be required to repurchase the loans from the investor or indemnify the investor for any losses incurred this may result in a loss which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

  

because almost all of our customers require mortgage financing the availability of suitable mortgage financing could impair the affordability of our homes lower demand for our products and limit our ability to fully deliver our backlog 

our business and earnings depend on the ability of our potential customers to obtain mortgages for the purchase of our homes in addition many of our potential customers must sell their existing homes in order to buy a home from us the tightening of credit standards and the availability of suitable mortgage financing could prevent customers from buying our homes and could prevent buyers of our customers’ homes from obtaining mortgages they need to complete that purchase both of which could result in our potential customers’ inability to buy a home from us if our potential customers or the buyers of our customers’ current homes are not able to obtain suitable financing the result could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

if our ability to sell mortgages to investors is impaired we may be required to fund these commitments ourselves or may not be able to originate loans at all 

our mortgage banking business sells all of the loans it originates into the secondary market usually within 30 to 60 days from the date of closing and has up to approximately 25 million available in a repurchase agreement to fund mortgage closings in october 2011 bank of america discontinued their correspondent lending program as a result this reduced the number of investors available in our loan sale distribution channels increasing the loan volume of the remaining correspondent investors and in turn lengthening the time period it takes for us to sell loans and increasing our inventory of mortgages held for sale at december 31 2011 in the event that other disruptions to the secondary markets similar to this and to those which occurred during 2007 and 2008 continue to tighten or eliminate the available liquidity within the secondary markets for mortgage loans or the underwriting requirements by our secondary market investors continue to become more stringent our ability to sell future mortgages could decline and we could be required among other things to fund our commitments to our buyers with our own financial resources which is limited or require our home buyers to find another source of financing the result of such secondary market disruption could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

interest rate movements inflation and other economic factors can negatively impact our business 

high rates of inflation generally affect the homebuilding industry adversely because of their adverse impact on interest rates high interest rates not only increase the cost of borrowed funds to homebuilders but also have a significant effect on housing demand and on the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective purchasers we are also subject to potential volatility in the price of commodities that impact costs of materials used in our homebuilding business increases in prevailing interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

our financial results also are affected by the risks generally incident to our mortgage banking business including interest rate levels the impact of government regulation on mortgage loan originations and servicing and the need to issue forward commitments to fund and sell mortgage loans our homebuilding customers account for almost all of our mortgage banking business the volume of our continuing homebuilding operations therefore affects our mortgage banking business 

our mortgage banking business also is affected by interest rate fluctuations we also may experience marketing losses resulting from daily increases in interest rates to the extent we are unable to match interest rates and amounts on loans we have committed to originate with forward commitments from third parties to purchase such loans increases in interest rates may have a material adverse effect on our mortgage banking revenue profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

  

our operations may also be adversely affected by other economic factors within our markets such as negative changes in employment levels job growth and consumer confidence and availability of mortgage financing one or all of which could result in reduced demand or price depression from current levels such negative trends could have a material adverse effect on homebuilding operations 

these factors and thus the homebuilding business have at times in the past been cyclical in nature any downturn in the national economy or the local economies of the markets in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations in particular approximately 35 of our home settlements during 2011 occurred in the washington dc and baltimore md metropolitan areas which accounted for approximately 46 of our homebuilding revenues in 2011 thus we are dependent to a significant extent on the economy and demand for housing in those areas 

our inability to secure and control an adequate inventory of lots could adversely impact our operations 

the results of our homebuilding operations are dependent upon our continuing ability to control an adequate number of homebuilding lots in desirable locations there can be no assurance that an adequate supply of building lots will continue to be available to us on terms similar to those available in the past or that we will not be required to devote a greater amount of capital to controlling building lots than we have historically an insufficient supply of building lots in one or more of our markets an inability of our developers to deliver finished lots in a timely fashion due to their inability to secure financing to fund development activities or for other reasons or our inability to purchase or finance building lots on reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

volatility in the credit and capital markets may impact our ability to access necessary financing 

if we require working capital greater than that provided by our operations we may be required to seek to obtain alternative financing no assurance can be given that additional financing will be available on terms that are favorable or acceptable in addition the credit and capital markets are experiencing significant volatility that is difficult to predict if we are required to seek financing to fund our working capital requirements continued volatility in these markets may restrict our flexibility to access financing if we are at any time unsuccessful in obtaining sufficient capital to fund our planned homebuilding expenditures we may experience a substantial delay in the completion of any homes then under construction or we may be unable to control or purchase finished building lots any delay could result in cost increases and could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

our mortgage banking operations are dependent in part on the availability cost and other terms of mortgage financing facilities and may be adversely affected by any shortage or increased cost of such financing no assurance can be given that any additional or replacement financing will be available on terms that are favorable or acceptable our mortgage banking operations are also dependent upon the securitization market for mortgagebacked securities and could be materially adversely affected by any fluctuation or downturn in such market 

government regulations and environmental matters could negatively affect our operations 

we are subject to various local state and federal statutes ordinances rules and regulations concerning zoning building design construction and similar matters including local regulations that impose restrictive zoning and density requirements in order to limit the number of homes that can eventually be built within the boundaries of a particular area these regulations may further increase the cost to produce and market our products in addition we have from time to time been subject to and may also be subject in the future to periodic delays in our homebuilding projects due to building moratoriums in the areas in which we 

  

operate changes in regulations that restrict homebuilding activities in one or more of our principal markets could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

we are also subject to a variety of local state and federal statutes ordinances rules and regulations concerning the protection of health and the environment we are subject to a variety of environmental conditions that can affect our business and our homebuilding projects the particular environmental laws that apply to any given homebuilding site vary greatly according to the location and environmental condition of the site and the present and former uses of the site and adjoining properties environmental laws and conditions may result in delays cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs or prohibit or severely restrict homebuilding activity in certain environmentally sensitive regions or areas thereby adversely affecting our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

in addition the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act enacted on july 21 2010 contains numerous provisions affecting residential mortgages and mortgage lending practices because these provisions are to be implemented through future rulemaking the ultimate impact of such provisions on lending institutions including our mortgage banking subsidiary will depend on how the implementing rules are written 

we are an approved sellerservicer of fnma mortgage loans and an approved lenderseller of gnma fhlmc va and fha mortgage loans and are subject to all of those agencies’ rules and regulations any significant impairment of our eligibility to sellservice these loans could have a material adverse impact on our mortgage operations in addition we are subject to regulation at the state and federal level with respect to specific origination selling and servicing practices including the real estate settlement and protection act adverse changes in governmental regulation may have a negative impact on our mortgage loan origination business 

we face competition in our housing and mortgage banking operations 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive we compete with numerous homebuilders of varying size ranging from local to national in scope some of whom have greater financial resources than we do we face competition 

 

  

  

 our homebuilding operations compete primarily on the basis of price location design quality service and reputation 

the mortgage banking industry is also competitive our main competition comes from national regional and local mortgage bankers thrifts banks and mortgage brokers in each of these markets our mortgage banking operations compete primarily on the basis of customer service variety of products offered interest rates offered prices of ancillary services and relative financing availability and costs 

there can be no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully in our homebuilding or mortgage banking operations an inability to effectively compete may have an adverse impact on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

a shortage of building materials or labor or increases in materials or labor costs may adversely impact our operations 

the homebuilding business has from time to time experienced building material and labor shortages 

  

including shortages in insulation drywall certain carpentry work and concrete as well as fluctuating lumber prices and supply in addition high employment levels and strong construction market conditions could restrict the labor force available to our subcontractors and us in one or more of our markets significant increases in costs resulting from these shortages or delays in construction of homes could have a material adverse effect upon our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

product liability litigation and warranty claims may adversely impact our operations 

construction defect and home warranty claims are common and can represent a substantial risk for the homebuilding industry the cost of insuring against construction defect and product liability related claims as well as the claims themselves can be high in addition insurance companies limit coverage offered to protect against these claims further restrictions on coverage availability or significant increases in premium costs or claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

we are subject to litigation proceedings that could harm our business if an unfavorable ruling were to occur 

from time to time we may become involved in litigation and other legal proceedings relating to claims arising from our operations in the normal course of business as described in but not limited to part i item 3 “legal proceedings” of this form 10k we are currently subject to certain legal proceedings litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings may occur we cannot assure you that these or other litigation or legal proceedings will not materially affect our ability to conduct our business in the manner that we expect or otherwise adversely affect us should an unfavorable ruling occur 

weatherrelated and other events beyond our control may adversely impact our operations 

extreme weather or other events such as significant snowfalls hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes forest fires floods terrorist attacks or war may affect our markets our operations and our profitability these events may impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or subcontractors causing us material increases in costs or delays in construction of homes which could have a material adverse effect upon our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows

 item 2 properties tableend our corporate offices are located in reston virginia where we currently lease approximately 61000 square feet of office space the current corporate office lease expires in april 2015 

in connection with the operation of the homebuilding segment we lease manufacturing facilities in the following six locations thurmont maryland burlington county new jersey farmington new york kings mountain north carolina darlington pennsylvania and portland tennessee these facilities range in size from approximately 40000 square feet to 400000 square feet and combined total approximately 1 million square feet of manufacturing space each of these leases contains various options for extensions of the lease and for the purchase of the facility the portland lease expires in 2014 the thurmont and farmington leases expire in 2019 the kings mountain and burlington county leases expire in 2022 and 2023 respectively and the darlington lease expires in 2025 in march 2011 we purchased a manufacturing facility in dayton ohio and began production in june 2011 the dayton facility contains approximately 100000 square feet of manufacturing space due to the economic downturn and the related decline in our homebuilding activity our current plant utilization has dropped to approximately 31 of total capacity 

  

we also in connection with both our homebuilding and mortgage banking businesses lease office space in multiple locations for homebuilding divisional offices and mortgage banking and title services branches under leases expiring at various times through 2019 none of which are individually material to our business we anticipate that upon expiration of existing leases we will be able to renew them or obtain comparable facilities on terms acceptable to us

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend on july 18 2007 former and current employees filed lawsuits against us in the court of common pleas in allegheny county pennsylvania and hamilton county ohio in superior court in durham county north carolina and in the circuit court in montgomery county maryland and on july 19 2007 in the superior court in new jersey alleging that we incorrectly classified our sales and marketing representatives as being exempt from overtime wages these lawsuits are similar in nature to another lawsuit filed on october 29 2004 by another former employee in the united states district court for the western district of new york the complaints seek injunctive relief an award of unpaid wages including fringe benefits liquidated damages equal to the overtime wages allegedly due and not paid attorney and other fees and interest and where available multiple damages the suits were filed as purported class actions however while a number of individuals have filed consents to join and assert federal claims in the new york action none of the groups of employees that the lawsuits purport to represent have been certified as a class the lawsuits filed in ohio pennsylvania maryland new jersey and north carolina have been stayed pending further developments in the new york action 

we believe that our compensation practices in regard to sales and marketing representatives are entirely lawful and in compliance with two letter rulings from the united states department of labor “dol” issued in january 2007 the three courts to most recently consider similar claims against other homebuilders have acknowledged the dol’s position that sales and marketing representatives were properly classified as exempt from overtime wages and the only court to have directly addressed the exempt status of such employees concluded that the dol’s position was valid accordingly we have vigorously defended and intend to continue to vigorously defend these lawsuits because we are unable to determine the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome of these cases or the amount of damages if any we have not recorded any associated liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 

in june 2010 we received a request for information from the united states environmental protection agency “epa” pursuant to section 308 of the clean water act the request sought information about storm water discharge practices in connection with homebuilding projects completed or underway by us in new york and new jersey we cooperated with this request and provided information to the epa we have since been informed by the united states department of justice “doj” that the epa forwarded the information on the matter to the doj and the doj requested that we meet with the government to discuss the status of the case a meeting took place in late january 2012 with representatives from both the epa and doj it is not yet known what next steps if any the doj will take in the matter we intend to continue cooperating with any future epa andor doj inquiries at this time we cannot predict the outcome of this inquiry nor can we reasonably estimate the potential costs that may be associated with its eventual resolution 

in august 2011 the wage and hour division of the us department of labor “dol” notified us that it was initiating an investigation to determine our compliance with the fair standards labor act “fsla” in the notice the dol requested certain information including payroll data for a two year period and multiple communityspecific items related to our homebuilding operations we have cooperated with this information request have either provided or made available the information that the dol has requested and expect to continue to cooperate with the dol’s investigation we believe that our payroll practices are in compliance with the fsla at this time we cannot predict the outcome of this investigation nor can we reasonably estimate the potential costs that may be associated with its eventual resolution 

we are also involved in various other litigation arising in the ordinary course of business in the opinion of management and based on advice of legal counsel this litigation is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows legal costs incurred in connection with outstanding litigation are expensed as incurred

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend  results of operations for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 

overview 

business 

our primary business is the construction and sale of singlefamily detached homes townhomes and condominium buildings all of which are primarily constructed on a presold basis to fully serve customers of our homebuilding operations we also operate a mortgage banking and title services business we primarily conduct our operations in mature markets additionally we generally grow our business through market share gains in our existing markets and by expanding into markets contiguous to our current active markets our four homebuilding reportable segments consist of the following regions 

 

   

our lot acquisition strategy is predicated upon avoiding the financial requirements and risks associated with direct land ownership and development historically we have not engaged in land development to obtain finished lots for use in our homebuilding operations instead we have acquired finished lots at market prices from various third party land developers pursuant to fixed price purchase agreements these purchase agreements require deposits typically ranging up to 10 of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots in the form of cash or letters of credit that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the purchase agreement this strategy has allowed us to maximize inventory turnover which we believe enables us to minimize market risk and to operate with less capital thereby enhancing rates of return on equity and total capital 

our continued success is contingent upon our ability to control an adequate supply of finished lots on which to build and on our developers’ ability to timely deliver finished lots to meet the sales demands of our customers however economic conditions and the continued downturn of the homebuilding industry have exerted pressure on our developers’ ability to obtain acquisition and development financing or to raise equity investments to finance land development activity potentially constraining our supply of finished lots this pressure has necessitated that in certain specific strategic circumstances we deviate from our historical lot acquisition strategy and engage in joint venture arrangements with land developers or directly acquire raw ground already zoned for its intended use for development once we acquire control of any raw ground we determine whether to sell the raw parcel to a developer and enter into a fixed price purchase agreement with the developer to purchase the finished lots or whether to hire a developer to develop the land on our behalf while joint venture arrangements and direct land development activity are not our preferred method of acquiring finished building lots we may enter into additional transactions in the future on a limited basis where there exists a compelling strategic or prudent financial reason to do so we expect however to continue to acquire substantially all of our finished lot inventory using fixed price purchase agreements with forfeitable deposits 

as of december 31 2011 we controlled approximately 48200 lots under purchase agreements with deposits in cash and letters of credit totaling approximately 202300 and 3200 respectively additionally we controlled approximately 6700 lots through joint venture limited liability corporations with an aggregate investment of approximately 89500 of the lots controlled by the joint ventures approximately 2700 were not under contract at december 31 2011 included in the number of controlled lots are approximately 10600 lots for which we have recorded a contract land deposit impairment reserve of approximately 70300 as of december 31 2011 see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information regarding contract land deposits further as of december 31 2011 we had approximately 78000 in land under development that once fully developed will result in approximately 800 lots 

in addition to constructing homes primarily on a presold basis and utilizing what we believe is a conservative lot acquisition strategy we focus on obtaining and maintaining a leading market position in each market we serve this strategy allows us to gain valuable efficiencies and competitive advantages in our markets which we believe contributes to minimizing the adverse effects of regional economic cycles and provides growth opportunities within these markets 

current business environment and key financial results 

the homebuilding environment remained challenging throughout 2011 as it continued to be impacted by the economic downturn and uncertainty that has been experienced over the past several years the sluggish economy and high unemployment rates continue to weigh on consumer confidence and in turn suppress housing demand in addition new home sales and selling prices continue to be pressured by market uncertainty surrounding home prices and by a more restrictive mortgage lending environment as a result our new orders net of cancellations “new orders” for 2011 were down 2 from the prior year while our average new order selling price of 3041 remained flat year over year gross profit margins in 2011 within our homebuilding business were negatively impacted by pricing pressure and increased construction and sales incentive costs year over year declining to 171 from 182 in 2010 

  

consolidated revenues totaled 2659149 for 2011 a decrease of 13 from 3041892 in 2010 net income declined 37 to 129420 in 2011 from the prior year and diluted earnings per share declined 31 to 2301 year over year 

we believe that significant economic uncertainties remain which could result in continued sales pricing and gross margin pressure over the next several quarters further our expectation of continued sales and pricing pressures has been factored into the impairment analysis of our homebuilding inventory land under development and contract land deposits we assess our land under development including land under development held in joint ventures and contract land deposits each quarter for impairment on a communitybycommunity basis by considering among other items overall market and economic conditions and analyzing as applicable current sales absorption levels and recent sales’ gross profit at this time we do not believe that any of the land under development is impaired and we consider the allowance for losses on contract land deposits reflected on the december 31 2011 balance sheet to be adequate further we believe that our homebuilding inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market however there can be no assurance that we will not incur impairment charges in the future due to unanticipated adverse changes in the economy or other events adversely affecting specific markets or the homebuilding industry in addition the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act enacted on july 21 2010 contains numerous provisions affecting residential mortgages and mortgage lending practices because these provisions are to be implemented through future rulemaking the ultimate impact of such provisions on lending institutions including our mortgage banking subsidiary will depend on how the implementing rules are written despite these ongoing economic uncertainties we believe that we are well positioned to withstand this market uncertainty and take advantage of opportunities that may arise due to the strength of our balance sheet and liquidity 

homebuilding operations 

the following table summarizes the results of our consolidated homebuilding operations and certain operating activity for each of the last three years 

 

 consolidated homebuilding revenues 

homebuilding revenues for 2011 decreased 12 from 2010 as a result of a 15 decrease in the number of homes settled offset partially by a 4 increase in the average settlement price year over year the decrease in the number of homes settled was attributable to a 17 lower beginning backlog unit balance entering 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010 coupled with lower new orders in the first half of 2011 as compared to the first half of 2010 average settlement prices in the current year were favorably impacted by an 8 higher average price of homes in the beginning backlog entering 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 

homebuilding revenues for 2010 increased 11 from 2009 as a result of an 11 increase in the number of homes settled the increase in the number of homes settled was primarily attributable to the impact of the 

  

federal homebuyer tax credit which resulted in strong first quarter sales and increased settlements through the second quarter of 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009 in addition the increase in settlements was also favorably impacted by a 12 higher beginning backlog unit balance entering 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 

consolidated homebuilding new orders 

new orders in 2011 decreased 2 when compared to the prior year while the average sales price of new orders remained flat year over year as discussed in the overview section above we continue to face selling pressure in most of our markets due to continuing economic uncertainty driven by low consumer confidence and high unemployment rates we expect to face continued sales and pricing pressure over the next several quarters until we see economic stability and improved consumer confidence levels 

new orders in 2010 remained flat with 2009 new orders while the average sales price of new orders increased 4 year over year new orders remained flat despite a strong first quarter in 2010 driven we believe by the federal homebuyer tax credit and increased sales in the indianapolis in orlando fl and raleigh nc markets each of which began operations in the second half of 2009 from the first quarter of 2010 we experienced a consistent decline in the number of new orders across all of our markets in each of the second third and fourth quarters of 2010 compared to the respective periods in 2009 the increase in the average price of new orders year over year was attributable to a product mix shift away from our attached products to our detached product which generally sell at higher price points 

consolidated homebuilding gross profit 

gross profit margins in 2011 declined to 171 from 182 in 2010 as discussed in the overview section above gross profit margins in 2011 were negatively impacted by pricing pressure and increased construction and sales incentive costs we expect to experience gross profit margin pressure over at least the next several quarters due to significant market uncertainties as discussed in the overview section above 

gross profit margins in 2010 declined slightly to 182 from 185 in 2009 gross profit margins in 2010 were negatively impacted by a contract land deposit impairment charge of approximately 4300 or 14 basis points while 2009 gross profit margins were favorably impacted by the recovery of approximately 6500 or 24 basis points of contract land deposits previously determined to be uncollectible 

consolidated homebuilding selling general and administrative “sga” 

sga expenses in 2011 increased approximately 6900 or 3 compared to 2010 and as a percentage of revenue increased to 101 in 2011 from 86 in the prior year the increase in sga expenses was primarily attributable to an approximate 10500 increase in equitybased compensation costs in 2011 compared to 2010 the increase in equitybased compensation resulted primarily from the favorable impact in 2010 of a reversal of approximately 6600 in equitybased compensation expense related to an adjustment of our stock option forfeiture estimates to our actual forfeiture experience while there was no forfeiture adjustment recorded in 2011 in addition the increase in equitybased compensation expense in 2011 resulted from incurring a full year of expense in 2011 for nonqualified stock options and restricted share units granted in the second quarter of 2010 under the 2010 equity incentive plan this increase in sga expenses was partially offset by an approximate 4100 decrease in personnel costs primarily driven by a 7800 decline in management incentives year over year sga expenses increased as a percentage of revenue due to the aforementioned 12 decrease in revenues year over year 

sga expenses in 2010 increased approximately 24200 compared to 2009 but remained flat as a percentage of revenue year over year the increase in sga expenses was attributable to an approximate 13500 increase in stockbased compensation costs in 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 due to the grant of nonqualified stock options and restricted share units under the 2010 equity incentive plan offset partially by a reversal of approximately 6600 in stockbased compensation expense previously recorded to 

  

sga expense as we adjusted our stock option forfeiture estimates to our actual forfeiture experience sga expense was also higher due to an approximate 5600 increase in management incentive costs as 2009 incentive plans were limited to payouts of 50 of incentive earned while no similar restrictions were imposed on 2010 incentive compensation in addition sga expenses were impacted by an approximate 7600 increase in selling and marketing costs year over year due primarily to an approximate 5700 increase in advertising and model home costs attributable in part to an increase in the average number of active communities to 371 communities in 2010 from 355 communities in 2009 

consolidated homebuilding backlog 

backlog units and dollars increased approximately 26 to 3676 and 21 to 1160879 respectively as of december 31 2011 compared to 2916 and 958287 as of december 31 2010 the increase in backlog units was primarily attributable to the decreased settlement activity in 2011 as discussed above backlog dollars were favorably impacted by the backlog unit increase offset partially by a 4 decline in the average price of homes in backlog in 2011 compared to 2010 

backlog which represents homes sold but not yet settled with the customer may be impacted by customer cancellations for various reasons that are beyond our control such as failure to obtain mortgage financing inability to sell an existing home job loss or a variety of other reasons in any period a portion of the cancellations that we experience are related to new sales that occurred during the same period and a portion are related to sales that occurred in prior periods and therefore appeared in the opening backlog for the current period expressed as the total of all cancellations during the period as a percentage of gross sales during the period our cancellation rate was approximately 14 in each of 2011 2010 and 2009 of a reporting quarter’s opening backlog 6 during 2011 and 2010 and 7 during 2009 of that opening backlog balance cancelled during the fiscal quarter we can provide no assurance that our historical cancellation rates are indicative of the actual cancellation rate that may occur in future periods see “risk factors” in item 1a of this report 

backlog units and dollars decreased approximately 17 to 2916 and 11 to 958287 respectively as of december 31 2010 compared to 3531 and 1076437 as of december 31 2009 the decrease in backlog units was primarily attributable to the increased settlement activity in 2010 as discussed above backlog dollars were negatively impacted by the decrease in backlog units 

  

reportable homebuilding segments 

homebuilding profit before tax includes all revenues and income generated from the sale of homes less the cost of homes sold sga expenses and a corporate capital allocation charge determined at the corporate headquarters the corporate capital allocation charge eliminates in consolidation is based on the segment’s average net assets employed and is charged using a consistent methodology in the years presented the corporate capital allocation charged to the operating segment allows the chief operating decision maker to determine whether the operating segment’s results are providing the desired rate of return after covering our cost of capital we record charges on contract land deposits when we determine that it is probable that recovery of the deposit is impaired for segment reporting purposes impairments on contract land deposits are generally charged to the operating segment upon the determination to terminate a finished lot purchase agreement with the developer or to restructure a lot purchase agreement resulting in the forfeiture of the deposit we evaluate our entire net contract land deposit portfolio for impairment each quarter for additional information regarding our contract land deposit impairment analysis see the critical accounting policies section within this management discussion and analysis for presentation purposes below the contract land deposit reserve at december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively has been allocated to the reportable segments to show contract land deposits on a net basis the net contract land deposit balances below also includes approximately 3200 6600 and 4900 at december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively of letters of credit issued as deposits in lieu of cash the following tables summarize certain homebuilding operating activity by reportable segment for each of the last three years

mid atlantic 

2011 versus 2010 

the mid atlantic segment had an approximate 61100 or 29 decrease in segment profit in 2011 compared to 2010 revenues decreased approximately 197700 or 11 in 2011 from 2010 on a 16 decrease in the number of units settled offset partially by a 6 increase in the average settlement price year over year the decrease in the number of homes settled was attributable to a 14 lower beginning backlog unit balance entering 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010 coupled with a 12 decline in new orders in the first half of 2011 compared to the first half of 2010 average settlement prices in the current year were favorably impacted by a 10 higher average price of homes in the beginning backlog entering 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 the segment’s gross profit margin percentage decreased to 181 in 2011 from 190 in 2010 segment profit and gross profit margins were negatively impacted by pricing pressure and increased construction and sales incentive costs in addition to the reduced settlement volume year over year and its impact on our ability to leverage certain operating costs 

segment new orders in 2011 declined approximately 3 from 2010 while the average sales price of new orders in 2011 remained flat year over year new orders were lower despite a 10 increase in the number of active communities year over year for the reasons previously discussed in the overview section above new orders were also negatively impacted by an increase in the cancellation rate to 133 in 2011 from 113 in 2010 

2010 versus 2009 

the mid atlantic segment had an approximate 23600 or 13 increase in segment profit in 2010 compared to 2009 revenues increased approximately 119300 or 7 in 2010 from 2009 on a 7 increase in the number of units settled the increase in units settled was attributable to the impact of the federal homebuyer tax credit which we believe resulted in higher first quarter sales and increased settlements through the second quarter of 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009 in addition 2010 settlements were also favorably impacted by a 5 higher beginning backlog unit balance entering 2010 as compared to 2009 the segment’s gross profit margin percentage increased to 190 in 2010 from 185 in 2009 segment profit and gross profit margins were favorably impacted by lower contract land deposit impairment charges in 2010 of 9150 or 51 basis points compared to 18425 or 111 basis points in 2009 

segment new orders in 2010 declined approximately 1 while the average sales price of new orders in 2010 increased approximately 5 as compared to new orders and the average sales price in 2009 the increase in the average price of new orders was attributable to a product mix shift away from our attached products to our detached product which generally sell at higher price points 

north east 

2011 versus 2010 

the north east segment had an approximate 11600 or 46 decrease in segment profit in 2011 compared to 2010 revenues decreased approximately 66400 or 23 in 2011 from 2010 the decrease in revenues was primarily due to a 21 decrease in the number of units settled which was attributable to a 29 lower backlog unit balance entering 2011 as compared to the backlog unit balance entering 2010 in addition settlements were negatively impacted by a slower backlog turnover rate in 2011 compared to 2010 gross profit margins remained relatively flat period over period as lower contract land deposit impairment charges in 2011 of 818 or 37 basis points compared to 2010 of 4898 or 170 basis points were offset by pricing pressure and increased construction and sales incentive costs year over year in addition gross profit margins and segment profit were negatively affected by the lower settlement volume year over year which impacted our ability to leverage certain operating costs 

  

segment new orders in 2011 increased 5 compared to 2010 while the average sales price of new orders decreased 5 year over year new orders were favorably impacted by the increase in the number of active communities year over year average selling prices were lower year over year due to a product mix shift from our detached product to our attached product which generally sells at lower price points 

2010 versus 2009 

the north east segment had an approximate 5500 or 28 increase in segment profit in 2010 compared to 2009 revenues increased approximately 32900 or 13 in 2010 from 2009 revenues increased due to a 4 increase in the number of units settled and an 8 increase in the average settlement price year over year the increase in units settled was primarily attributable to the impact of the federal homebuyer tax credit which we believe resulted in higher first quarter sales and increased settlements through the second quarter of 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009 the increase in the average settlement price resulted from a product mix shift away from our attached products to our detached product which generally sells at higher price points gross profit margins remained relatively flat period over period as the higher contract land deposit impairment charges in 2010 of 4898 or 170 basis points compared to 2009 of 2489 or 98 basis points were offset by improved leveraging of fixed operating costs due to higher settlement volume year over year 

segment new orders in 2010 decreased 9 compared to 2009 while the average sales price of new orders increased 8 year over year subsequent to the april 30 2010 expiration of the federal homebuyer tax credit we experienced a decline in new orders in each quarter of 2010 as compared to the respective quarters of 2009 the average sales price of new orders has been favorably impacted by a product mix shift away from our attached products to our detached product which generally sells at higher price points 

mid east 

2011 versus 2010 

the mid east segment had an approximate 29700 or 52 decrease in segment profit in 2011 compared to 2010 driven by a decrease in revenues of approximately 83000 or 13 year over year the decline in revenues was primarily due to a 19 decrease in the number of units settled offset partially by a 7 increase in the average price of homes settled year over year units settled in 2011 were negatively impacted by a 24 lower beginning backlog unit balance entering 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 coupled with a 15 decline in new orders in the first half of 2011 compared to the first half of 2010 the increase in the average settlement price in 2011 is attributable to a 4 higher average price of homes in the beginning backlog year over year and an 8 higher average price of new orders in the first half of 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 gross profit margins declined to 155 in 2011 from 173 in 2010 gross profit margins and segment profit were negatively impacted by pricing pressure and increased construction and sales incentive costs year over year and by the lower settlement volume year over year which impacted our ability to leverage certain operating costs 

segment new orders in 2011 decreased 9 compared to 2010 while the average new order selling price increased 8 year over year new orders were lower year over year due to the economic circumstances discussed in the o verview section above in addition new orders were negatively impacted by a lower number of active communities in certain of our markets year over year most notably the ohio and new york regions which were down 10 and 11 respectively the increase in the average selling price is attributable to a shift in mix to higher priced communities in certain markets 

2010 versus 2009 

the mid east segment had an approximate 18900 or 50 increase in segment profit in 2010 compared to 2009 the increase in segment profit was driven by an increase in revenues of approximately 126900 or 25 in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to a 24 increase in the number of units settled year over year the increase in units settled was attributable to the impact of the federal homebuyer tax credit which we believe resulted in higher first quarter sales and increased settlements through the second quarter of 2010 as 

  

compared to the same period in 2009 in addition settlements were favorably impacted by a 31 higher beginning backlog entering 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 gross profit margins remained relatively flat year over year at 173 in 2010 compared to 170 in 2009 

segment new orders and the average new order selling price in 2010 increased 4 and 2 respectively compared to 2009 new orders were favorably impacted primarily by the 178 new orders in 2010 in indianapolis in market which began operations in the fourth quarter of 2009 this increase was offset partially by an increase in the cancellation rate in both the third and fourth quarters of 2010 to 21 in each quarter as compared to 15 and 13 in the third and fourth quarters of 2009 respectively 

south east 

2011 versus 2010 

the south east segment had an approximate 3300 or 30 increase in segment profit in 2011 compared to 2010 despite an 8 decrease in revenues year over year the number of units settled remained flat year over year while the average price of homes settled in 2011 decreased 9 compared to 2010 the decrease in the average settlement price in 2011 is attributable to the 7 lower average price of units in backlog entering 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 gross profit margins increased to 163 in 2011 from 147 in 2010 due primarily to lower contract land deposit impairment charges in 2011 of 311 or 12 basis points compared to 4618 or 165 basis points in 2010 despite this gross profit margin improvement year over year the south east segment’s gross profit margins similar to our other segments have been negatively impacted by pricing pressure and increased construction and sales incentive costs year over year 

segment new orders increased 16 in 2011 compared to 2010 while the average selling price of new orders decreased 6 year over year the increase in new orders is primarily attributable to an increase in the number of active communities in the raleigh nc and orlando fl markets in addition new orders were favorably impacted by a decline in the cancellation rate in the south east segment to 13 in 2011 from 19 in 2010 the decrease in the average selling price is attributable to product mix shift to lower priced more affordable homes in certain of our markets in the south east segment 

2010 versus 2009 

the south east segment had an approximate 3500 or 47 increase in segment profit in 2010 compared to 2009 the increase in segment profit was driven by an increase of approximately 18200 or 7 in revenues in 2010 from 2009 due primarily to a 6 increase in the number of units settled the increase in units settled was primarily attributable to the impact of the federal homebuyer tax credit which we believe resulted in higher first quarter sales and increased settlements through the second quarter of 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009 in addition settlements were favorably impacted by an 8 higher beginning backlog entering 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 gross profit margins increased to 147 in 2010 from 139 in 2009 due in part to lower contract land deposit impairment charges in 2010 of 4618 or 165 basis points compared to 5236 or 200 basis points in 2009 coupled with improved leveraging of fixed operating costs due to higher settlement volume year over year 

segment new orders and the average sales price of new orders for 2010 remained relatively flat with 2009 new orders were favorably impacted by an 18 increase in the average number of active communities year over year and by the increase of approximately 80 new orders in 2010 in the orlando fl and raleigh nc markets in which we began operations in the third quarter of 2009 these favorable variances were offset by higher cancellations rates in the segment in both the third and fourth quarters of 2010 of 32 and 19 respectively compared to 14 and 18 for the respective quarters of 2009 and lower absorption rates year over year market conditions continued to deteriorate in this segment throughout 2010 the challenging market conditions coupled with the expiration of the federal homebuyer tax credit in april of 2010 attributed to the segment’s higher cancellation rates and fewer new orders in each the second third and fourth quarters of 2010 as compared to the respective quarters in 2009 

  

homebuilding segment reconciliations to consolidated homebuilding operations 

in addition to the corporate capital allocation and contract land deposit impairments discussed above the other reconciling items between homebuilding segment profit and homebuilding consolidated profit before tax include unallocated corporate overhead which includes all management incentive compensation stockbased compensation expense consolidation adjustments and external corporate interest expense our overhead functions such as accounting treasury human resources etc are centrally performed and the costs are not allocated to our operating segments consolidation adjustments consist of such items to convert the reportable segments’ results which are predominantly maintained on a cash basis to a full accrual basis for external financial statement presentation purposes and are not allocated to our operating segments likewise stockbased compensation expense is not charged to the operating segments external corporate interest expense is primarily comprised of interest charges on our senior notes and is not charged to the operating segments because the charges are included in the corporate capital allocation discussed above 

 

  

     

  

  

  mortgage banking segment 

we conduct our mortgage banking activity through nvr mortgage finance inc “nvrm” a wholly owned subsidiary nvrm focuses almost exclusively on serving the homebuilding segment’s customer base following is a table of financial and statistical data for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 

 

   

2011 versus 2010 

loan closing volume for the year ended december 31 2011 decreased 16 from 2010 the 2011 decrease was primarily attributable to an 18 decrease in the number of units closed partially offset by a 3 increase in the average loan amount year over year the decrease in the number of units closed and the increase in the average loan amount are primarily attributable to the aforementioned decrease in the homebuilding segment’s number of units settled and the increase in the average settlement prices in 2011 as compared to 2010 the decrease in the number of units closed was also partially attributable to a 2 percentage point decrease in the number of loans closed by nvrm for our homebuyers who obtain a mortgage to purchase the home “capture rate” which decreased to 88 compared to 90 in 2010 

segment profit for the year ended december 31 2011 decreased approximately 9600 from 2010 the decrease in segment profit was primarily attributable to an approximate 13200 decrease in mortgage banking fees partially offset by an approximate 3350 decrease in general and administrative expenses the decrease in mortgage banking fees was primarily attributable to the aforementioned 16 decrease in closed loan volume the decrease in general and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to an approximate 1200 decrease in the provision for loan loss and an approximate 1500 decrease in management incentive compensation compared to the same period in 2010 

2010 versus 2009 

loan closing volume for the year ended december 31 2010 increased 8 from 2009 the 2010 increase was primarily attributable to a 7 increase in the number of units closed and a 1 increase in the average loan amount year over year the increases in the number of units closed and the average loan amount are attributable to the increase in the homebuilding segment’s number of units settled and the increase in the average settlement prices in 2010 as compared to 2009 

segment profit for the year ended december 31 2010 decreased approximately 2400 from 2009 the decrease in segment profit was primarily attributable to an approximate 5800 increase in general and administrative expenses the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of a 6000 increase in the provision for loan loss compared to 2009 the 5800 increase in general and administrative expenses was partially offset by an approximate 2500 increase in interest income primarily as a result of the change in our loan sale distribution channels 

mortgage banking – other 

we sell all of the loans we originate into the secondary mortgage market insofar as we underwrite our originated loans to the standards and specifications of the ultimate investor we have no further financial obligations from the issuance of loans except in certain limited instances where early payment default occurs those underwriting standards are typically equal to or more stringent than the underwriting standards required by fnma va and fha nvrm has always maintained an allowance for losses on mortgage loans originated that reflects our judgment of the present loss exposure in the loans that we have originated and sold the allowance is calculated based on an analysis of historical experience and anticipated losses on mortgages held for investment real estate owned and specific expected loan repurchases or indemnifications for the period january 1 2005 to december 31 2011 we have originated approximately 19032000 of mortgage loans and have cumulative actual charges incurred related to mortgage indemnifications and repurchases of approximately 5800 during that period because we sell all of our loans and do not service them there is often a substantial delay between the time that a loan goes into default and the time that the investor requests us to reimburse them for losses incurred because of the default we believe that all of the loans that we originate are underwritten to the standards and specifications of the ultimate investor to whom we sell our originated loans we employ a quality control department to ensure that our underwriting controls are effective and further assess the underwriting function as part of our assessment of internal controls over financial reporting at december 31 2011 we had an allowance for loan losses of approximately 12850 although we consider the allowance for loan losses reflected on the december 31 2011 balance sheet to be adequate there can be no assurance that this allowance will prove to be adequate to cover losses on loans previously originated 

  

historically we sold a substantial number of our loans to bank of america through their correspondent lending program however in october 2011 bank of america discontinued their correspondent lending program as a result this decreased the number of investors available in our loan sale distribution channels the remaining correspondent investors are now dealing with a larger volume of loans and are performing a much more comprehensive review of loan files prior to purchase which has resulted in loans remaining in inventory for a longer period of time before being sold prior to bank of america discontinuing their correspondent lending program loans were typically sold within 30 days this time period has now increased to 30 to 60 days resulting in an increase in the mortgages held for sale balance included in the consolidated balance sheet for december 31 2011 compared to the prior year 

nvrm is dependent on our homebuilding segment’s customers for business as new orders and selling prices of the homebuilding segment decline nvrm’s operations will also be adversely affected in addition the mortgage segment’s operating results may be adversely affected in future periods due to the continued tightening and volatility of the credit markets as well as increased regulation of mortgage lending practices 

seasonality 

overall we do not experience material seasonal fluctuations in sales settlements or loan closings 

effective tax rate 

our consolidated effective tax rate in 2011 2010 and 2009 was 3765 3610 and 3560 respectively the 2009 effective tax rate was favorably impacted by the expiration of certain tax reserves the receipt of tax refunds from the amendment of certain prior year federal and state returns and a tax benefit related to compensation expense recorded for certain outstanding option grants that were previously considered to be a permanent nondeductible tax difference

liquidity and capital resources 

lines of credit and notes payable 

our homebuilding segment provides for its working capital cash requirements using cash generated from operations effective october 27 2010 we voluntarily terminated our 300000 unsecured working capital revolving credit facility which was set to expire on december 6 2010 we currently do not intend to enter into a new credit facility however effective october 27 2010 we entered into an uncommitted collateralized letter of credit facility to issue letters of credit in our ordinary course of business see note 11 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of letters of credit 

  

our mortgage subsidiary nvrm provides for its mortgage origination and other operating activities using cash generated from operations borrowings from its parent company nvr as well as a revolving mortgage repurchase facility which is nonrecourse to nvr on august 2 2011 nvrm entered into a repurchase agreement with us bank national association which provides for loan purchases up to 25000 subject to certain sublimits “repurchase agreement” the repurchase agreement replaced our expiring 125000 revolving mortgage repurchase agreement the purpose of the repurchase agreement is to finance the origination of mortgage loans by nvrm the repurchase agreement expires on august 1 2012 

advances under the repurchase agreement carry a pricing rate based on the libor rate plus the libor margin or the default pricing rate as determined under the repurchase agreement provided that the pricing rate shall not be less than 375 there are several restrictions on purchased loans including that they cannot be sold to others they cannot be pledged to anyone other than the agent and they cannot support any other borrowing or repurchase agreement the repurchase agreement contains various affirmative and negative covenants the negative covenants include among others certain limitations on transactions involving acquisitions mergers the incurrence of debt sale of assets and creation of liens upon any of its mortgage notes additional covenants include i a tangible net worth requirement ii a minimum liquidity requirement iii a minimum net income requirement and iv a maximum leverage ratio requirement the company was in compliance with all covenants under the repurchase agreement at december 31 2011 at december 31 2011 there was no debt outstanding under the repurchase agreement and there were no borrowing base limitations the average pricing rate for amounts outstanding under the previous repurchase agreement at december 31 2010 was 41 

equity repurchases 

in addition to funding growth in our homebuilding and mortgage banking operations we historically have used a substantial portion of our excess liquidity to repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock in open market and privately negotiated transactions this ongoing repurchase activity is conducted pursuant to publicly announced board authorizations and is typically executed in accordance with the safeharbor provisions of rule 10b18 promulgated under the securities and exchange act of 1934 as amended in addition the board resolutions authorizing us to repurchase shares of our common stock specifically prohibit us from purchasing shares from our officers directors profit sharing401k plan trust or employee stock ownership plan trust the repurchase program assists us in accomplishing our primary objective creating increases in shareholder value see part ii item 5 of this form 10k for disclosure of amounts repurchased during the fourth quarter of 2011 for the year ended december 31 2011 we repurchased 1017588 shares of our common stock at an aggregate purchase price of approximately 689300 as of december 31 2011 we had approximately 319900 available under two board approved repurchase authorizations 

cash flows 

for the year ended december 31 2011 cash and cash equivalents decreased by 712956 net cash provided by operating activities was 1463 cash provided by homebuilding operations was used to fund the increase to homebuilding inventory of 99527 as a result of an increase in the units under construction at the end of 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010 in addition cash was used to fund the 42385 increase in contract land deposits year over year the presentation of operating cash flows was reduced by 22835 which is the amount of the excess tax benefit realized from stock option exercises and deferred compensation plan distributions during 2011 and credited directly to additional paid in capital investing activities during 2011 used net cash of 61866 primarily as a result of our investment in a joint venture with morgan stanley real estate investing of 61250 see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included herein for further discussion in addition cash was used to purchase 11444 in property plant and equipment during 2011 these uses of cash from investing activities were partially offset by capital distributions received from our unconsolidated joint ventures net cash used by financing activities was 652553 during 2011 we spent approximately 689300 to repurchase 1017588 shares of our common stock under our ongoing common stock 

  

repurchase program as discussed above in addition cash was used in the repayment of approximately 90000 of the outstanding nvrm repurchase facility due to our decision to substantially reduce the available credit capacity under the repurchase agreement these uses of cash from financing activities were offset partially by equitybased activity which provided stock option exercise proceeds of 106999 and the realization of 22835 in excess income tax benefits from stock option exercises and deferred compensation plan distributions 

for the year ended december 31 2010 cash and cash equivalents decreased by 56400 net cash provided by operating activities was 55388 cash was provided primarily by homebuilding operations and was used to fund increases to contract land deposits the presentation of operating cash flows was reduced by 63558 which is the amount of the excess tax benefit realized from stock option exercises and deferred compensation plan distributions during 2010 and credited directly to additional paid in capital investing activities provided net cash of 212440 primarily due to the net redemption of 219535 in marketable securities at maturity during the year net cash used by financing activities was 324228 during 2010 we repurchased 644562 shares of our common stock at an aggregate purchase price of 417079 under our ongoing common stock repurchase program in addition we redeemed the remaining outstanding 5 senior notes due 2010 totaling 133370 upon their maturity on june 15 2010 stock option exercise activity during 2010 provided 77492 in exercise proceeds and we realized 63558 in excess income tax benefits from the exercise of stock options and deferred compensation plan distributions we also increased net borrowings under the mortgage warehouse facility by 77579 due to a change in the distribution channel for the sale of mortgage loans closed 

in 2009 cash and cash equivalents increased by approximately 102500 operating activities provided cash of 241642 cash was provided primarily by homebuilding operations and by an approximate 32400 decrease in mortgage loans held for sale the presentation of operating cash flows was reduced by approximately 66400 which is the amount of the excess tax benefit realized from the exercise of stock options and deferred compensation plan distributions during the period and credited directly to additional paid in capital net cash used for investing activities during 2009 was 221617 for the year ended december 31 2009 which primarily resulted from the net purchase of marketable securities during 2009 the marketable securities which were debt securities issued by the us treasury and other us government corporations and agencies were classified as heldtomaturity securities and matured within one year net cash provided by financing activities during 2009 was 82482 financing cash flow was favorably impacted by approximately 78500 of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the realization of approximately 66400 in excess income tax benefits from the exercise of stock options and deferred compensation plan distributions cash was used by financing activities to reduce net borrowings under the mortgage warehouse facility by approximately 32200 and we repurchased 29950 of our 5 senior notes due 2010 at par during 2009 

at december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 the homebuilding segment had restricted cash of approximately 19119 22889 and 4600 respectively which is included in “other assets” on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets the higher restricted cash balances in 2011 and 2010 as compared to 2009 were primarily attributable to holding requirements related to outstanding letters of credit issued under the letter of credit agreement we entered into in october 2010 as discussed further in note 11 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements in addition restricted cash relates to customer deposits for certain home sales 

we believe that our current cash holdings cash generated from operations and borrowings available under our mortgage repurchase agreement and the public debt and equity markets will be sufficient to satisfy near and long term cash requirements for working capital and debt service in both our homebuilding and mortgage banking operations 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

lot acquisition strategy 

we generally do not engage in land development instead we typically acquire finished building lots at market prices from various land developers under fixed price purchase agreements that require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the agreement the deposits required under the purchase agreements are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percentage typically ranging up to 10 of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots 

we believe that our lot acquisition strategy reduces the financial requirements and risks associated with direct land ownership and land development we may at our option choose for any reason and at any time not to perform under these purchase agreements by delivering notice of our intent not to acquire the finished lots under contract our sole legal obligation and economic loss for failure to perform under these purchase agreements is limited to the amount of the deposit pursuant to the liquidated damage provision contained within the purchase agreements we do not have any financial guarantees or completion obligations and we typically do not guarantee lot purchases on a specific performance basis under these purchase agreements 

at december 31 2011 we controlled approximately 53000 lots with an aggregate purchase price of approximately 4600000 by making or committing to make deposits of approximately 253000 in the form of cash and letters of credit our entire risk of loss pertaining to the aggregate purchase price contractual commitment resulting from our nonperformance under the contracts is limited to our 205500 deposit paid plus the additional 47500 referred to below of the 253000 deposit total approximately 202300 was in cash and approximately 3200 was in letters of credit which had been issued as of december 31 2011 the remaining balance of approximately 47500 relates to deposits to be paid subsequent to december 31 2011 assuming that contractual development milestones are met by the developers see contractual obligations section below as of december 31 2011 we had recorded an impairment valuation allowance of approximately 70300 related to the cash deposits currently outstanding please refer to note 1 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of the contract land deposits and note 3 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of our lot acquisition strategy in relation to our accounting related to the consolidation of variable interest entities  

bonds and letters of credit 

we enter into bond or letter of credit arrangements with local municipalities government agencies or land developers to collateralize our obligations under various contracts we had approximately 46300 of contingent obligations under such agreements as of december 31 2011 inclusive of the 3200 of lot acquisition deposits in the form of letters of credit discussed above we believe we will fulfill our obligations under the related contracts and do not anticipate any material losses under these bonds or letters of credit 

mortgage commitments and forward sales 

in the normal course of business our mortgage banking segment enters into contractual commitments to extend credit to buyers of singlefamily homes with fixed expiration dates the commitments become effective when the borrowers “lockin” a specified interest rate within time frames established by us all mortgagors are evaluated for credit worthiness prior to the extension of the commitment market risk arises if interest rates move adversely between the time of the “lockin” of rates by the borrower and the sale date of the loan to a brokerdealer to mitigate the effect of the interest rate risk inherent in providing rate lock commitments to borrowers we enter into optional or mandatory delivery forward sale contracts to sell whole loans and mortgagebacked securities to brokerdealers the forward sale contracts lock in an interest rate and price for the sale of loans similar to the specific rate lock commitments we do not engage in speculative or trading derivative activities both the rate lock commitments to borrowers and the forward sale contracts to brokerdealers are undesignated derivatives and accordingly are marked to fair value through earnings at december 31 2011 there were contractual commitments to extend credit to borrowers aggregating 126929 and open forward delivery contracts aggregating 353555 please refer to note 12 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of our fair value accounting 

  

contractual obligations 

our fixed noncancelable obligations as of december 31 2011 were as follows 

 

  

     critical accounting policies 

general 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods we continually 

  

evaluate the estimates we use to prepare the consolidated financial statements and update those estimates as necessary in general our estimates are based on historical experience on information from third party professionals and other various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances actual results could differ materially from those estimates made by management 

homebuilding inventory 

the carrying value of inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market value cost of lots and completed and uncompleted housing units represent the accumulated actual cost of the units field construction supervisors’ salaries and related direct overhead expenses are included in inventory costs interest costs are not capitalized into inventory with the exception of land under development upon settlement the cost of the unit is expensed on a specific identification basis cost of manufacturing materials is determined on a firstin firstout basis 

sold inventory is evaluated for impairment based on the contractual selling price compared to the total estimated cost to construct unsold inventory is evaluated for impairment by analyzing recent comparable sales prices within the applicable community compared to the costs incurred to date plus the expected costs to complete any calculated impairments are recorded immediately 

land under development and contract land deposits 

land under development 

on a very limited basis we directly acquire raw parcels of land already zoned for its intended use to develop into finished lots land under development includes the land acquisition costs direct improvement costs capitalized interest where applicable and real estate taxes 

land under development including the land under development held by our unconsolidated joint ventures and the related joint venture investments is reviewed for potential writedowns when impairment indicators are present in addition to considering market and economic conditions we assess land under development impairments on a communitybycommunity basis analyzing as applicable current sales absorption levels recent sales’ gross profit and the dollar differential between the projected fullydeveloped cost of the lots and the current market price for lots if indicators of impairment are present for a community we perform an analysis to determine if the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts and if they are impairment charges are required to be recorded in an amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets our determination of fair value is primarily based on discounting the estimated future cash flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams 

at december 31 2011 we had approximately 78000 in land under development in three separate communities in addition at december 31 2011 we had an aggregate investment totaling approximately 89500 in four separate jvs that controlled land under development none of the three communities classified as land under development nor any of the undeveloped land held by the four jvs had any indicators of impairment at december 31 2011 as such we do not believe that any of the land under development is impaired at this time however there can be no assurance that we will not incur impairment charges in the future due to unanticipated adverse changes in the economy or other events adversely affecting specific markets or the homebuilding industry 

contract land deposits 

we purchase finished lots under fixed price purchase agreements that require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the contract the deposits are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percentage of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots 

  

we maintain an allowance for losses on contract land deposits that reflects our judgment of the present loss exposure in the existing contract land deposit portfolio at the end of the reporting period to analyze contract land deposit impairments we utilize a loss contingency analysis that is conducted each quarter in addition to considering market and economic conditions we assess contract land deposit impairments on a communitybycommunity basis pursuant to the purchase contract terms analyzing as applicable current sales absorption levels recent sales’ gross profit the dollar differential between the contractual purchase price and the current market price for lots a developer’s financial stability a developer’s financial ability or willingness to reduce lot prices to current market prices and the contract’s default status by either us or the developer along with an analysis of the expected outcome of any such default 

our analysis is focused on whether we can sell houses profitably in a particular community in the current market with which we are faced because we don’t own the finished lots on which we had placed a contract land deposit if the above analysis leads to a determination that we can’t sell homes profitably at the current contractual lot price we then determine whether we will elect to default under the contract forfeit our deposit and terminate the contract or whether we will attempt to restructure the lot purchase contract which may require us to forfeit the deposit to obtain contract concessions from a developer we also assess whether an impairment is present due to collectability issues resulting from a developer’s nonperformance because of financial or other conditions 

although we consider the allowance for losses on contract land deposits reflected on the december 31 2011 consolidated balance sheet to be adequate see note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included herein there can be no assurance that this allowance will prove to be adequate over time to cover losses due to unanticipated adverse changes in the economy or other events adversely affecting specific markets or the homebuilding industry 

intangible assets 

reorganization value in excess of identifiable assets “excess reorganization value” is an indefinite life intangible asset that was created upon our emergence from bankruptcy on september 30 1993 based on the allocation of our reorganization value the portion of our reorganization value which was not attributed to specific tangible or intangible assets has been reported as excess reorganization value which is treated similarly to goodwill excess reorganization value is not subject to amortization rather excess reorganization value is subject to an impairment assessment on an annual basis or more frequently if changes in events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred because excess reorganization value was based on the reorganization value of our entire enterprise upon bankruptcy emergence the impairment assessment is conducted on an enterprise basis based on the comparison of our total equity compared to the market value of our outstanding publiclytraded common stock we do not believe that excess reorganization value is impaired at this time however changes in strategy or continued adverse changes in market conditions could impact this judgment and require an impairment loss to be recognized if our book value including excess reorganization value exceeds the fair value 

warranty  product liability accruals 

warranty and product liability accruals are established to provide for estimated future costs as a result of construction and product defects product recalls and litigation incidental to our business liability estimates are determined based on our judgment considering such factors as historical experience the likely current cost of corrective action manufacturers’ and subcontractors’ participation in sharing the cost of corrective action consultations with third party experts such as engineers and evaluations by our general counsel and outside counsel retained to handle specific product liability cases although we consider the warranty and product liability accrual reflected on the december 31 2011 consolidated balance sheet to be adequate see note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included herein there can be no assurance that this accrual will prove to be adequate over time to cover losses due to increased costs for material and labor the inability or refusal of manufacturers or subcontractors to financially participate in corrective action unanticipated adverse legal settlements or other unanticipated changes to the assumptions used to estimate the warranty and product liability accrual 

  

equitybased compensation expense 

compensation costs related to our equitybased compensation plans are recognized within our income statement the costs recognized are based on the grant date fair value compensation cost for sharebased grants is recognized on a straightline basis over the requisite service period for the entire award from the date of grant through the period of the last separately vesting portion of the grant 

we calculate the fair value of our nonpublicly traded employee stock options using the blackscholes optionpricing model while the blackscholes model is a widely accepted method to calculate the fair value of options its results are dependent on input variables two of which expected term and expected volatility are significantly dependent on management’s judgment we have concluded that our historical exercise experience is the best estimate of future exercise patterns to determine an option’s expected term to estimate expected volatility we analyze the historical volatility of our common stock over a period equal to the option’s expected term changes in management’s judgment of the expected term and the expected volatility could have a material effect on the grantdate fair value calculated and expensed within the income statement in addition we are required to estimate future grant forfeitures when considering the amount of stockbased compensation costs to record we have concluded that our historical forfeiture rate is the best measure to base our estimate of future forfeitures of equitybased compensation grants however there can be no assurance that our future forfeiture rate will not be materially higher or lower than our historical forfeiture rate which would affect the aggregate cumulative compensation expense recognized 

mortgage loan loss allowance 

we originate several different loan products to our customers to finance the purchase of their home we sell all of the loans we originate into the secondary mortgage market generally within 30 to 60 days from origination all of the loans that we originate are underwritten to the standards and specifications of the ultimate investor insofar as we underwrite our originated loans to those standards we bear no increased concentration of credit risk from the issuance of loans except in certain limited instances where early payment default occurs those underwriting standards are typically equal to or more stringent than the underwriting standards required by fnma va and fha we employ a quality control department to ensure that our underwriting controls are effectively operating and further assess the underwriting function as part of our assessment of internal controls over financial reporting we maintain an allowance for losses on mortgage loans originated that reflects our judgment of the present loss exposure in the loans that we have originated and sold the allowance is calculated based on an analysis of historical experience and anticipated losses on mortgages held for investment real estate owned and specific expected loan repurchases or indemnifications although we consider the allowance for loan losses reflected on the december 31 2011 consolidated balance sheet to be adequate see note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included herein there can be no assurance that this allowance will prove to be adequate over time to cover losses due to unanticipated changes to the assumptions used to estimate the mortgage loan loss allowance

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk tableend market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates our market risk arises from interest rate risk inherent in our financial instruments interest rate risk results from the possibility that changes in interest rates will cause unfavorable changes in net income or in the value of interest ratesensitive assets liabilities and commitments lower interest rates tend to increase demand for mortgage loans for home purchasers while higher interest rates make it more difficult for potential borrowers to purchase residential properties and to qualify for mortgage loans we have no market rate sensitive instruments held for speculative or trading purposes 

  

our mortgage banking segment is exposed to interest rate risk as it relates to its lending activities the mortgage banking segment originates mortgage loans which are sold through either optional or mandatory forward delivery contracts into the secondary markets all of the mortgage banking segment’s loan portfolio is held for sale and subject to forward sale commitments nvrm also sells all of its mortgages held for sale on a servicing released basis 

nvrm has available a mortgage repurchase agreement which provides for loan repurchases up to 25000 subject to certain sub limits the repurchase agreement is used to fund nvrm’s mortgage origination activities advances under the repurchase agreement carry a pricing rate based on the libor rate plus the libor margin or the default pricing rate as determined under the repurchase agreement provided that the pricing rate shall not be less than 375 at december 31 2011 there was no debt outstanding under the repurchase agreement 

the following table represents the contractual balances of our onbalance sheet financial instruments at the expected maturity dates as well as the fair values of those onbalance sheet financial instruments at december 31 2011 the table does not include the debt of our consolidated joint venture as it is nonrecourse to us the expected maturity categories take into consideration the actual and anticipated amortization of principal and do not take into consideration the reinvestment of cash or the refinancing of existing indebtedness because we sell all of the mortgage loans we originate into the secondary markets we have made the assumption that the portfolio of mortgage loans held for sale will mature in the first year consequently advances outstanding under the repurchase agreement are also assumed to mature in the first year

 item 1 business 

general 

nvr inc “nvr” was formed in 1980 as nvhomes inc our primary business is the construction and sale of singlefamily detached homes townhomes and condominium buildings to more fully serve customers of our homebuilding operations we also operate a mortgage banking and title services business we conduct our homebuilding activities directly our mortgage banking operations are operated primarily through a wholly owned subsidiary nvr mortgage finance inc “nvrm” unless the context otherwise requires references to “nvr” “we” “us” or “our” include nvr and its consolidated subsidiaries 

we are one of the largest homebuilders in the united states while we operate in multiple locations in fourteen states primarily in the eastern part of the united states approximately 37 of our home settlements in 2010 occurred in the washington dc and baltimore md metropolitan areas which accounted for 47 of our 2010 homebuilding revenues our homebuilding operations include the construction and sale of singlefamily detached homes townhomes and condominium buildings under four trade names ryan homes nvhomes fox ridge homes and rymarc homes the ryan homes fox ridge homes and rymarc homes products are marketed primarily to firsttime homeowners and firsttime moveup buyers the ryan homes product is currently sold in twentythree metropolitan areas located in maryland virginia west virginia pennsylvania new york north carolina south carolina ohio new jersey delaware kentucky indiana and florida the fox ridge homes product is sold solely in the nashville tn metropolitan area and the rymarc homes product is sold solely in the columbia sc metropolitan area the nvhomes product is marketed primarily to moveup and upscale buyers and is sold in the washington dc baltimore md philadelphia pa and the maryland eastern shore metropolitan areas in 2010 our average price of a settled unit was approximately 297100 

historically we generally have not engaged in land development see discussion below on our recent limited land development activities instead we typically acquire finished building lots at market prices from various development entities under fixed price purchase agreements “purchase agreements” that require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the purchase agreement the deposits required under the purchase agreements are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percentage typically ranging up to 10 of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots 

we believe that our lot acquisition strategy avoids the financial requirements and risks associated with direct land ownership and land development we may at our option choose for any reason and at any time not to perform under these purchase agreements by delivering notice of our intent not to acquire the finished lots under contract our sole legal obligation and economic loss for failure to perform under these purchase agreements is limited to the amount of the deposit pursuant to the liquidated damage provision contained within the purchase agreements we do not have any financial guarantees or completion obligations and we typically do not guarantee lot purchases on a specific performance basis under these purchase agreements none of the creditors of any of the development entities with which we have entered these purchase agreements have recourse to our general credit we generally seek to maintain control over a supply of lots believed to be suitable to meet our fiveyear business plan 

our continued success is contingent upon our ability to control an adequate supply of finished lots on which to build and on our developers’ ability to timely deliver finished lots to meet the sales demands of our customers however current economic conditions and the continued downturn of the homebuilding industry have exerted pressure on our developers’ ability to obtain acquisition and development financing or to raise equity investments to finance land development activity potentially constraining our supply of finished lots this pressure has necessitated that in certain specific strategic circumstances we deviate from our historical lot acquisition strategy and engage in joint venture arrangements with land developers or directly acquire raw ground already zoned for its intended use for development once we acquire control of any raw ground we will determine whether to sell the raw parcel to a developer and enter into a fixed price purchase agreement with the 

  developer to purchase the finished lots or whether we will hire a developer to develop the land on our behalf while joint venture arrangements and direct land development activity are not our preferred method of acquiring finished building lots we may enter into additional transactions in the future on a limited basis where there exists a compelling strategic or prudent financial reason to do so we expect however to continue to acquire substantially all of our finished lot inventory using fixed price purchase agreements with forfeitable deposits 

as of december 31 2010 we controlled approximately 50400 lots under purchase agreements with deposits in cash and letters of credit totaling approximately 1743 million and 66 million respectively included in the number of controlled lots are approximately 10300 lots for which we have recorded a contract land deposit impairment reserve of approximately 735 million as of december 31 2010 in addition we had an aggregate investment totaling approximately 37 million in three separate joint venture limited liability corporations “jvs” through which we controlled approximately 1100 lots further as of december 31 2010 we directly acquired four separate raw parcels of land zoned for their intended use with a current cost basis including development costs of approximately 78 million that we intend to develop into approximately 890 finished lots for use in our homebuilding operations see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information regarding jvs and land under development 

in addition to building and selling homes we provide a number of mortgagerelated services through our mortgage banking operations through operations in each of our homebuilding markets nvrm originates mortgage loans almost exclusively for our homebuyers nvrm generates revenues primarily from origination fees gains on sales of loans and title fees nvrm sells all of the mortgage loans it closes into the secondary markets on a servicing released basis 

segment information for our homebuilding and mortgage banking businesses is included in note 2 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

current business environment 

during 2010 the homebuilding environment continued to be negatively impacted by economic uncertainty the market stabilization we experienced toward the end of 2009 and into the first quarter of 2010 was negatively impacted by the april 30 2010 expiration of the federal homebuyer tax credit after april 30 2010 new home sales experienced sharp declines providing evidence that rather than increasing overall demand the tax credit may have merely accelerated existing demand the current home sales environment continues to be adversely impacted by high inventory levels low consumer confidence driven by high unemployment rates and a highly restrictive mortgage lending environment that has made it more difficult for our customers to obtain mortgage financing for additional information and analysis of recent trends in our operations and financial condition see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 of this form 10k 

homebuilding 

  products 

we offer singlefamily detached homes townhomes and condominium buildings with many different basic home designs these home designs have a variety of elevations and numerous other options our homes combine traditional or colonial exterior designs with contemporary interior designs and amenities generally include two to four bedrooms and range from approximately 1000 to 7300 square feet during 2010 the prices at which we settled homes ranged from approximately 97000 to 17 million and averaged approximately 297100 during 2009 our average price was approximately 296400 

  markets 

our four reportable homebuilding segments operate in the following geographic regions 

 

further discussion of settlements new orders and backlog activity by homebuilding reportable segment for each of the last three years can be found in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 of this form 10k 

  backlog 

backlog totaled 2916 units and approximately 10 billion at december 31 2010 compared to backlog of 3531 units and approximately 11 billion at december 31 2009 backlog which represents homes sold but not yet settled with the customer may be impacted by customer cancellations for various reasons that are beyond our control such as failure to obtain mortgage financing inability to sell an existing home job loss or a variety of other reasons in any period a portion of the cancellations that we experience are related to new sales that occurred during the same period and a portion are related to sales that occurred in prior periods and therefore appeared in the opening backlog for the current period expressed as the total of all cancellations during the period as a percentage of gross sales during the period our cancellation rate was approximately 14 14 and 23 in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively during 2010 2009 and 2008 approximately 6 7 and 10 of a reporting quarter’s opening backlog cancelled during the fiscal quarter respectively we can provide no assurance that our historical cancellation rates are indicative of the actual cancellation rate that may occur in future periods see “risk factors” in item 1a of this form 10k 

  construction 

we utilize independent subcontractors under fixed price contracts to perform construction work on our homes the subcontractors’ work is performed under the supervision of our employees who monitor quality control we use several independent subcontractors in our various markets and we are not dependent on any single subcontractor or on a small number of subcontractors 

  sales and marketing 

our preferred marketing method is for customers to visit a furnished model home featuring many builtin options and a landscaped lot the garages of these model homes are usually converted into temporary sales centers where alternative facades and floor plans are displayed and designs for other models are available for review sales representatives are compensated predominantly on a commission basis 

  regulation 

we and our subcontractors must comply with various federal state and local zoning building environmental advertising and consumer credit statutes rules and regulations as well as other regulations and requirements in connection with our construction and sales activities all of these regulations have increased the cost to produce and market our products and in some instances have delayed our developers’ abilities to deliver us finished lots counties and cities in which we build homes have at times declared moratoriums on the issuance of building permits and imposed other restrictions in the areas in which sewage treatment facilities and other public facilities do not reach minimum standards to date restrictive zoning laws and the imposition of moratoriums have not had a material adverse effect on our construction activities however in certain markets in which we operate we believe that our growth has been hampered by the longer time periods necessary for our developers to obtain the necessary governmental approvals 

    competition and market factors 

the housing industry is highly competitive we compete with numerous homebuilders of varying size ranging from local to national in scope some of which have greater financial resources than we do we also face competition from the home resale market our homebuilding operations compete primarily on the basis of price location design quality service and reputation historically we have been one of the market leaders in each of the markets where we build homes 

the housing industry is cyclical and is affected by consumer confidence levels prevailing economic conditions and interest rates other factors that affect the housing industry and the demand for new homes include the availability and the cost of land labor and materials changes in consumer preferences demographic trends and the availability of mortgage finance programs see “risk factors” in item 1a of this form 10k 

we are dependent upon building material suppliers for a continuous flow of raw materials whenever possible we utilize standard products available from multiple sources in the past such raw materials have been generally available to us in adequate supply 

mortgage banking 

we provide a number of mortgage related services to our homebuilding customers through our mortgage banking operations our mortgage banking operations also include separate subsidiaries that broker title insurance and perform title searches in connection with mortgage loan closings for which they receive commissions and fees because nvrm originates mortgage loans almost exclusively for our homebuilding customers nvrm is dependent on our homebuilding segment in 2010 nvrm closed approximately 8600 loans with an aggregate principal amount of approximately 22 billion as compared to approximately 8000 loans with an aggregate principal amount of approximately 21 billion in 2009 

nvrm sells all of the mortgage loans it closes to investors in the secondary markets on a servicing released basis typically within 30 days from the loan closing nvrm is an approved sellerservicer for fnma gnma fhlmc va and fha mortgage loans 

  competition and market factors 

nvrm’s main competition comes from national regional and local mortgage bankers mortgage brokers thrifts and banks in each of these markets nvrm competes primarily on the basis of customer service variety of products offered interest rates offered prices of ancillary services and relative financing availability and costs 

  regulation 

nvrm is an approved sellerservicer of fnma gnma fhlmc fha and va mortgage loans and is subject to all of those agencies’ rules and regulations these rules and regulations restrict certain activities of nvrm nvrm is currently eligible and expects to remain eligible to participate in such programs in addition nvrm is subject to regulation at the state and federal level with respect to specific origination selling and servicing practices 

  pipeline 

nvrm’s mortgage loans in process that have not closed “pipeline” at december 31 2010 and 2009 had an aggregate principal balance of approximately 670 million and 770 million respectively nvrm’s cancellation rate was approximately 29 in 2010 during 2009 and 2008 nvrm’s loan cancellation rates were approximately 35 and 49 respectively we can provide no assurance that our historical loan cancellation rates are indicative of the actual loan cancellation rate that may occur in future periods see “risk factors” in item 1a in this form 10k 

  employees 

at december 31 2010 we employed 2822 fulltime persons of whom 1076 were officers and management personnel 174 were technical and construction personnel 580 were sales personnel 490 were administrative personnel and 502 were engaged in various other service and labor activities none of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement and we have never experienced a work stoppage we believe that our employee relations are good

  our business is affected by the risks generally incident to the residential construction business including but not limited to 

 

all of these risks are discussed in detail below 

the homebuilding industry continues to experience a significant downturn the continuation of this slowdown could adversely affect our business and our results of operations 

the homebuilding industry has continued to experience a significant downturn as a result of declining consumer confidence driven by an economic recession high unemployment levels affordability issues and uncertainty as to the stability of home prices additionally the tightening credit markets have made it more difficult for customers to obtain financing to purchase homes as a result we have experienced reduced demand for new homes our cancellation rate was approximately 14 in both 2010 and 2009 and was 23 in 2008 these ongoing market factors have also resulted in pricing pressures and in turn gross profit margin pressure in all of our markets a continued downturn in the homebuilding industry could result in a material adverse effect on our sales fewer gross sales andor higher cancellation rates profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

if the market value of our inventory or controlled lot position declines our profit could decrease and we may incur losses 

inventory risk can be substantial for homebuilders the market value of building lots and housing inventories can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing market conditions in addition inventory carrying costs can be significant and can result in losses in a poorly performing project or market we must in the ordinary course of our business continuously seek and make acquisitions of lots for expansion into new markets as well as for replacement and expansion within our current markets which is accomplished by us entering fixed price purchase agreements and paying forfeitable deposits under the purchase agreement to developers for the contractual right to acquire the lots in the event of further adverse changes in economic or market conditions we may cease further building activities in communities or restructure existing purchase agreements resulting in forfeiture of some or all of any remaining land contract deposit paid to the developer either action may result in a loss which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

if the underwriting quality of our mortgage originations is found to be deficient our profit could decrease and we may incur losses 

we originate several different loan products to our customers to finance the purchase of their home we sell all of the loans we originate into the secondary mortgage market generally within 30 days from origination all of the loans that we originate are underwritten to the standards and specifications of the ultimate investor insofar as we underwrite our originated loans to those standards we bear no increased concentration of credit risk from the issuance of loans except in certain limited instances where early payment default occurs in the event that a substantial number of the loans that we have originated fall into default and the investors to whom we sold the loan determine that we did not underwrite the loan in accordance with their requirements we could be required to repurchase the loans from the investor or indemnify the investor for any losses incurred this may result in a loss which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

  because almost all of our customers require mortgage financing the availability of suitable mortgage financing could impair the affordability of our homes lower demand for our products and limit our ability to fully deliver our backlog 

our business and earnings depend on the ability of our potential customers to obtain mortgages for the purchase of our homes in addition many of our potential customers must sell their existing homes in order to buy a home from us the tightening of credit standards and the availability of suitable mortgage financing could prevent customers from buying our homes and could prevent buyers of our customers’ homes from obtaining mortgages they need to complete that purchase both of which could result in our potential customers’ inability to buy a home from us if our potential customers or the buyers of our customers’ current homes are not able to obtain suitable financing the result could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

if our ability to sell mortgages to investors is impaired we may be required to fund these commitments ourselves or may not be able to originate loans at all 

our mortgage segment sells all of the loans it originates into the secondary market usually within 30 days from the date of closing and has up to approximately 100 million available in a repurchase agreement to fund mortgage closings in the event that disruptions to the secondary markets similar to those which occurred during 2007 and 2008 continue to tighten or eliminate the available liquidity within the secondary markets for mortgage loans or the underwriting requirements by our secondary market investors continue to become more stringent our ability to sell future mortgages could decline and we could be required among other things to fund our commitments to our buyers with our own financial resources which is limited or require our home buyers to find another source of financing the result of such secondary market disruption could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

interest rate movements inflation and other economic factors can negatively impact our business 

high rates of inflation generally affect the homebuilding industry adversely because of their adverse impact on interest rates high interest rates not only increase the cost of borrowed funds to homebuilders but also have a significant effect on housing demand and on the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective purchasers we are also subject to potential volatility in the price of commodities that impact costs of materials used in our homebuilding business increases in prevailing interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

our financial results also are affected by the risks generally incident to our mortgage banking business including interest rate levels the impact of government regulation on mortgage loan originations and servicing and the need to issue forward commitments to fund and sell mortgage loans our homebuilding customers account for almost all of our mortgage banking business the volume of our continuing homebuilding operations therefore affects our mortgage banking business 

our mortgage banking business also is affected by interest rate fluctuations we also may experience marketing losses resulting from daily increases in interest rates to the extent we are unable to match interest rates and amounts on loans we have committed to originate with forward commitments from third parties to purchase such loans increases in interest rates may have a material adverse effect on our mortgage banking revenue profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

our operations may also be adversely affected by other economic factors within our markets such as negative changes in employment levels job growth and consumer confidence and availability of mortgage financing one or all of which could result in reduced demand or price depression from current levels such negative trends could have a material adverse effect on homebuilding operations 

  these factors and thus the homebuilding business have at times in the past been cyclical in nature any downturn in the national economy or the local economies of the markets in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations in particular approximately 37 of our home settlements during 2010 occurred in the washington dc and baltimore md metropolitan areas which accounted for 47 of our homebuilding revenues in 2010 thus we are dependent to a significant extent on the economy and demand for housing in those areas 

our inability to secure and control an adequate inventory of lots could adversely impact our operations 

the results of our homebuilding operations are dependent upon our continuing ability to control an adequate number of homebuilding lots in desirable locations there can be no assurance that an adequate supply of building lots will continue to be available to us on terms similar to those available in the past or that we will not be required to devote a greater amount of capital to controlling building lots than we have historically an insufficient supply of building lots in one or more of our markets an inability of our developers to deliver finished lots in a timely fashion due to their inability to secure financing to fund development activities or for other reasons or our inability to purchase or finance building lots on reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

volatility in the credit and capital markets may impact our ability to access necessary financing 

our homebuilding operations are dependent in part on the availability and cost of working capital financing and may be adversely affected by a shortage or an increase in the cost of such financing if we require working capital greater than that provided by our operations we may be required to seek to obtain alternative financing no assurance can be given that additional financing will be available on terms that are favorable or acceptable in addition the credit and capital markets are experiencing significant volatility that is difficult to predict if we are required to seek financing to fund our working capital requirements continued volatility in these markets may restrict our flexibility to access financing if we are at any time unsuccessful in obtaining sufficient capital to fund our planned homebuilding expenditures we may experience a substantial delay in the completion of any homes then under construction or we may be unable to control or purchase finished building lots any delay could result in cost increases and could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

our mortgage banking operations are dependent on the availability cost and other terms of mortgage financing facilities and may be adversely affected by any shortage or increased cost of such financing no assurance can be given that any additional or replacement financing will be available on terms that are favorable or acceptable our mortgage banking operations are also dependent upon the securitization market for mortgagebacked securities and could be materially adversely affected by any fluctuation or downturn in such market 

our current indebtedness may impact our future operations 

our existing indebtedness contains financial and other restrictive covenants and any future indebtedness may also contain covenants these covenants include or could include limitations on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness pay cash dividends and make distributions make loans and investments enter into transactions with affiliates effect certain asset sales incur certain liens merge or consolidate with any other person or transfer all or substantially all of our properties and assets substantial losses by us or other action or inaction by us or our subsidiaries could result in the violation of one or more of these covenants which could result in decreased liquidity or a default on our current or future indebtedness thereby having a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

  government regulations and environmental matters could negatively affect our operations 

we are subject to various local state and federal statutes ordinances rules and regulations concerning zoning building design construction and similar matters including local regulations that impose restrictive zoning and density requirements in order to limit the number of homes that can eventually be built within the boundaries of a particular area these regulations may further increase the cost to produce and market our products in addition we have from time to time been subject to and may also be subject in the future to periodic delays in our homebuilding projects due to building moratoriums in the areas in which we operate changes in regulations that restrict homebuilding activities in one or more of our principal markets could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

we are also subject to a variety of local state and federal statutes ordinances rules and regulations concerning the protection of health and the environment we are subject to a variety of environmental conditions that can affect our business and our homebuilding projects the particular environmental laws that apply to any given homebuilding site vary greatly according to the location and environmental condition of the site and the present and former uses of the site and adjoining properties environmental laws and conditions may result in delays cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs or prohibit or severely restrict homebuilding activity in certain environmentally sensitive regions or areas thereby adversely affecting our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

in addition the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act enacted on july 21 2010 contains numerous provisions affecting residential mortgages and mortgage lending practices because these provisions are to be implemented through future rulemaking the ultimate impact of such provisions on lending institutions including our mortgage banking subsidiary will depend on how the implementing rules are written 

we are an approved sellerservicer of fnma gnma fhlmc fha and va mortgage loans and are subject to all of those agencies’ rules and regulations any significant impairment of our eligibility to sellservice these loans could have a material adverse impact on our mortgage operations in addition we are subject to regulation at the state and federal level with respect to specific origination selling and servicing practices including the real estate settlement and protection act adverse changes in governmental regulation may have a negative impact on our mortgage loan origination business 

we face competition in our housing and mortgage banking operations 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive we compete with numerous homebuilders of varying size ranging from local to national in scope some of whom have greater financial resources than we do we face competition 

 

our homebuilding operations compete primarily on the basis of price location design quality service and reputation 

the mortgage banking industry is also competitive our main competition comes from national regional and local mortgage bankers thrifts banks and mortgage brokers in each of these markets our mortgage banking operations compete primarily on the basis of customer service variety of products offered interest rates offered prices of ancillary services and relative financing availability and costs 

  there can be no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully in our homebuilding or mortgage banking operations an inability to effectively compete may have an adverse impact on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

a shortage of building materials or labor or increases in materials or labor costs may adversely impact our operations 

the homebuilding business has from time to time experienced building material and labor shortages including shortages in insulation drywall certain carpentry work and concrete as well as fluctuating lumber prices and supply in addition high employment levels and strong construction market conditions could restrict the labor force available to our subcontractors and us in one or more of our markets significant increases in costs resulting from these shortages or delays in construction of homes could have a material adverse effect upon our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

product liability litigation and warranty claims may adversely impact our operations 

construction defect and home warranty claims are common and can represent a substantial risk for the homebuilding industry the cost of insuring against construction defect and product liability related claims as well as the claims themselves can be high in addition insurance companies limit coverage offered to protect against these claims further restrictions on coverage availability or significant increases in premium costs or claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

we are subject to litigation proceedings that could harm our business if an unfavorable ruling were to occur 

from time to time we may become involved in litigation and other legal proceedings relating to claims arising from our operations in the normal course of business as described in but not limited to part i item 3 “legal proceedings” of this form 10k we are currently subject to certain legal proceedings litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings may occur we cannot assure you that these or other litigation or legal proceedings will not materially affect our ability to conduct our business in the manner that we expect or otherwise adversely affect us should an unfavorable ruling occur 

weatherrelated and other events beyond our control may adversely impact our operations 

extreme weather or other events such as significant snowfalls hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes forest fires floods terrorist attacks or war may affect our markets our operations and our profitability these events may impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or subcontractors causing us material increases in costs or delays in construction of homes which could have a material adverse effect upon our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows

 item 2 properties 

our corporate offices are located in reston virginia where we currently lease approximately 61000 square feet of office space the current corporate office lease expires in april 2015 

in connection with the operation of the homebuilding segment we lease manufacturing facilities in the following six locations thurmont maryland burlington county new jersey farmington new york kings mountain north carolina darlington pennsylvania and portland tennessee these facilities range in size from approximately 40000 square feet to 400000 square feet and combined total approximately 1 million square feet of manufacturing space each of these leases contains various options for extensions of the lease and 

  for the purchase of the facility the portland thurmont and farmington leases expire in 2014 and the kings mountain and burlington county leases expire in 2022 and 2023 respectively the darlington lease expires in 2025 we expect to purchase a new manufacturing facility in the first quarter of 2011 in dayton oh the new facility will contain approximately 100000 square feet of manufacturing space and production from the dayton facility is expected to begin by the end of 2011 due to the economic downturn and the related decline in our homebuilding activity our current plant utilization has dropped to approximately 40 of total capacity 

we also in connection with both our homebuilding and mortgage banking businesses lease office space in multiple locations for homebuilding divisional offices and mortgage banking and title services branches under leases expiring at various times through 2018 none of which are individually material to our business we anticipate that upon expiration of existing leases we will be able to renew them or obtain comparable facilities on terms acceptable to us 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

on july 18 2007 former and current employees filed lawsuits against the company in the court of common pleas in allegheny county pennsylvania and hamilton county ohio in superior court in durham county north carolina and in the circuit court in montgomery county maryland and on july 19 2007 in the superior court in new jersey alleging that we incorrectly classified our sales and marketing representatives as being exempt from overtime wages these lawsuits are similar in nature to another lawsuit filed on october 29 2004 by another former employee in the united states district court for the western district of new york the complaints seek injunctive relief an award of unpaid wages including fringe benefits liquidated damages equal to the overtime wages allegedly due and not paid attorney and other fees and interest and where available multiple damages the suits were filed as purported class actions however while a number of individuals have filed consents to join and assert federal claims in the new york action none of the groups of employees that the lawsuits purport to represent have been certified as a class the lawsuits filed in ohio pennsylvania maryland new jersey and north carolina have been stayed pending further developments in the new york action 

we believe that our compensation practices in regard to sales and marketing representatives are entirely lawful and in compliance with two letter rulings from the united states department of labor “dol” issued in january 2007 the two courts to most recently consider similar claims against other homebuilders have acknowledged the dol’s position that sales and marketing representatives were properly classified as exempt from overtime wages and the only court to have directly addressed the exempt status of such employees concluded that the dol’s position was valid accordingly we have vigorously defended and intend to continue to vigorously defend these lawsuits because we are unable to determine the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome of this case or the amount of damages if any we have not recorded any associated liabilities in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets 

in june 2010 we received a request for information from the united states environmental protection agency the “epa” pursuant to section 308 of the clean water act the request seeks information about storm water discharge practices in connection with homebuilding projects completed or underway by us we have been cooperating with this request have provided information to the epa and intend to continue cooperating with the epa’s inquiries at this time we cannot predict the outcome of this inquiry nor can we reasonably estimate the potential costs that may be associated with its eventual resolution 

in april 2010 nvrm received a report of examination “roe” from the office of the commissioner of banks of the state of north carolina the “nccob” reporting certain findings that resulted from the nccob’s examination of selected files relating to loans originated by us in north carolina between august 1 2006 and august 31 2009 the roe alleged that certain of the loan files reflected violations of north carolina andor us lending or consumer protection laws the roe requested that we correct or otherwise address the alleged violations and in some instances requested that we undertake an examination of all of our other loans in north carolina to determine whether similar alleged violations may have occurred and if so to take corrective action we responded to the roe by letter dated june 10 2010 contesting the findings and allegations providing factual information to correct certain of the findings and refuting the nccob’s interpretation of applicable law on november 15 2010 the nccob provided a written response to our june 10 2010 letter 

  closing certain alleged violations while reasserting certain others on january 12 2011 we responded to the nccob’s november 15 2010 letter providing additional factual information to address the remaining findings and refuting the nccob’s interpretation of applicable law accordingly while the outcome of the matter is currently not determinable we do not expect resolution of the matter to have a material adverse effect on our financial position 

we are also involved in various other litigation arising in the ordinary course of business in the opinion of management and based on advice of legal counsel this litigation is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations

dollars in thousands except per share data 

results of operations for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 

overview 

  business 

our primary business is the construction and sale of singlefamily detached homes townhomes and condominium buildings all of which are primarily constructed on a presold basis to fully serve customers of our homebuilding operations we also operate a mortgage banking and title services business we primarily conduct our operations in mature markets additionally we generally grow our business through market share gains in our existing markets and by expanding into markets contiguous to our current active markets our four homebuilding reportable segments consist of the following regions 

  mid atlantic maryland virginia west virginia and delaware 

  north east new jersey and eastern pennsylvania 

  mid east kentucky new york ohio western pennsylvania and indiana 

  south east north carolina south carolina tennessee and florida 

  our lot acquisition strategy is predicated upon avoiding the financial requirements and risks associated with direct land ownership and development historically we have not engaged in land development to obtain finished lots for use in our homebuilding operations instead we have acquired finished lots at market prices from various third party land developers pursuant to fixed price purchase agreements these purchase agreements require deposits typically ranging up to 10 of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots in the form of cash or letters of credit that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the purchase agreement this strategy has allowed us to maximize inventory turnover which we believe enables us to minimize market risk and to operate with less capital thereby enhancing rates of return on equity and total capital 

our continued success is contingent upon our ability to control an adequate supply of finished lots on which to build and on our developers’ ability to timely deliver finished lots to meet the sales demands of our customers however current economic conditions and the continued downturn of the homebuilding industry have exerted pressure on our developers’ ability to obtain acquisition and development financing or to raise equity investments to finance land development activity potentially constraining our supply of finished lots this pressure has necessitated that in certain specific strategic circumstances we deviate from our historical lot acquisition strategy and engage in joint venture arrangements with land developers or directly acquire raw ground already zoned for its intended use for development once we acquire control of any raw ground we will determine whether to sell the raw parcel to a developer and enter into a fixed price purchase agreement with the developer to purchase the finished lots or whether we will hire a developer to develop the land on our behalf while joint venture arrangements and direct land development activity are not our preferred method of acquiring finished building lots we may enter into additional transactions in the future on a limited basis where there exists a compelling strategic or prudent financial reason to do so we expect however to continue to acquire substantially all of our finished lot inventory using fixed price purchase agreements with forfeitable deposits 

as of december 31 2010 we controlled approximately 50400 lots under purchase agreements with deposits in cash and letters of credit totaling approximately 174300 and 6600 respectively in addition we controlled approximately 1100 lots through joint ventures included in the number of controlled lots are approximately 10300 lots for which we have recorded a contract land deposit impairment reserve of approximately 73500 as of december 31 2010 see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information regarding contract land deposits further as of december 31 2010 we had approximately 78000 in land under development that once fully developed will result in approximately 890 lots 

in addition to constructing homes primarily on a presold basis and utilizing what we believe is a conservative lot acquisition strategy we focus on obtaining and maintaining a leading market position in each market we serve this strategy allows us to gain valuable efficiencies and competitive advantages in our markets which we believe contributes to minimizing the adverse effects of regional economic cycles and provides growth opportunities within these markets 

  current business environment 

the homebuilding environment in 2010 remained challenging as it continued to be impacted by the economic downturn that began several years prior the market stabilization we had experienced toward the end of 2009 and into the first quarter of 2010 was negatively impacted by the april 30 2010 expiration of the federal homebuyer tax credit after april 30 2010 new home sales experienced sharp declines providing evidence that rather than increasing overall demand the tax credit may have merely accelerated existing demand the current home sales environment continues to be adversely impacted by high inventory levels low consumer confidence driven by high unemployment rates and a highly restrictive mortgage lending environment that has made it more difficult for our customers to obtain mortgage financing our new orders for 2010 remained flat with new orders in 2009 however new housing demand declined in both the third and fourth quarters of 2010 from the higher new order results experienced in the first two quarters of 2010 in addition cancellation rates increased to 18 in both the third and fourth quarters of 2010 compared to 14 and 15 in the third and fourth quarters of 2009 respectively and 12 in the second quarter of 2010 

  consolidated revenues totaled 3041892 for 2010 an increase of 11 from 2743848 in 2009 the increase in revenues was driven by increased home settlements primarily resulting from the expiration of the federal homebuyer tax credit in the second quarter of 2010 net income and diluted earnings per share in 2010 each increased 7 from 2009 gross profit margins within our homebuilding business declined slightly to 182 in 2010 from 185 in 2009 

although we believe we have once again begun to experience some pricing stabilization in several of our markets as we enter 2011 we believe that significant economic uncertainties remain which could result in continued sales and pricing pressure over the next several quarters in addition the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act enacted on july 21 2010 contains numerous provisions affecting residential mortgages and mortgage lending practices because these provisions are to be implemented through future rulemaking the ultimate impact of such provisions on lending institutions including our mortgage banking subsidiary will depend on how the implementing rules are written 

despite these ongoing economic uncertainties we believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities that may arise due to the strength of our balance sheet and liquidity as of december 31 2010 our cash and cash equivalents balance totaled approximately 1200000 in addition during 2010 we redeemed the remaining 133370 of our outstanding senior notes upon their maturity and repurchased approximately 417080 of our common stock 

homebuilding operations 

the following table summarizes the results of our consolidated homebuilding operations and certain operating activity for each of the last three years 

 

consolidated homebuilding revenues 

homebuilding revenues for 2010 increased 11 from 2009 as a result of an 11 or 988 unit increase in the number of homes settled the increase in the number of homes settled was primarily attributable to the impact of the federal homebuyer tax credit which resulted in strong first quarter sales and increased settlements through the second quarter of 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009 in addition the increase in settlements was also favorably impacted by a 12 higher beginning backlog unit balance entering 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 

homebuilding revenues for 2009 decreased 26 from 2008 as a result of a 16 or 1699 unit decrease in the number of homes settled and a 12 decrease in the average settlement price the decrease in the number of units settled was primarily attributable to our beginning backlog units being approximately 39 or 1981 units lower entering 2009 compared to the backlog unit balance entering 2008 offset partially by a higher backlog turnover rate period over period average settlement prices were impacted primarily by a 15 lower 

  average price of homes in the beginning backlog entering 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 coupled with a 9 decline in the average sales price of new orders for the first six months of 2009 as compared to the same period in 2008 

consolidated homebuilding new orders 

new orders in 2010 remained flat with 2009 new orders while the average sales price of new orders increased 4 year over year new orders remained flat despite a strong first quarter in 2010 driven we believe by the federal homebuyer tax credit and increased sales in the indianapolis in orlando fl and raleigh nc markets each of which began operations in the second half of 2009 since the first quarter of 2010 we experienced a consistent decline in the number of new orders across all of our markets in each of the second third and fourth quarters of 2010 compared to the respective periods in 2009 the increase in the average price of new orders was attributable to a product mix shift away from our attached products to our detached product which generally sell at higher price points we expect to continue to face selling pressure over the next several quarters due to continuing economic uncertainties including low consumer confidence and high unemployment rates as discussed in the overview section above 

new orders in 2009 increased by 7 compared to 2008 while the average sales price of new orders decreased 6 year over year the increase in new orders in 2009 was in part attributable to a 47 increase in new orders in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 a period in which we experienced a significant dropoff in new orders due to a sharp decline in overall economic conditions in addition new orders in 2009 were favorably impacted by higher absorption rates offsetting the 17 decrease in the average number of active communities year over year we believe new orders in 2009 were also favorably impacted by the firsttime homebuyer federal tax credit as well as by a decrease in the cancellation rate to 14 in 2009 from 23 in 2008 during 2009 to meet affordability issues in many of our markets we altered our product offerings to provide smaller lower priced products 

consolidated homebuilding gross profit 

gross profit margins in 2010 declined slightly to 182 from 185 in 2009 gross profit margins in 2010 were negatively impacted by a contract land deposit impairment charge of approximately 4300 or 14 basis points while 2009 gross profit margins were favorably impacted by the recovery of approximately 6500 or 24 basis points of contract land deposits previously determined to be uncollectible we expect to experience gross profit margin pressure over at least the next several quarters due to significant market uncertainties as discussed in the overview section above 

gross profit margins in 2009 improved to 185 compared to 126 in 2008 primarily due to a favorable variance in contract land deposit impairment charges year over year in 2009 we recognized the recovery of approximately 6500 or 24 basis points of contract land deposits previously determined to be uncollectible in 2008 we recognized a contract land deposit impairment charge of approximately 165000 or 454 basis points gross profit margins in 2009 were also favorably impacted as a result of us exiting a significant number of poor performing communities in 2008 which were producing lower gross profit margins in addition gross profit margins in 2009 were favorably impacted by lower lumber and certain other commodity costs as well as by cost control measures implemented to reduce subcontractor and material costs in prior periods 

consolidated homebuilding selling general and administrative “sga” 

sga expenses in 2010 increased approximately 24200 compared to 2009 but remained flat as a percentage of revenue year over year the increase in sga expenses was attributable to an approximate 13500 increase in stockbased compensation costs in 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 due to the grant of nonqualified stock options and restricted share units under the 2010 equity incentive plan offset partially by a reversal of approximately 6600 in stockbased compensation expense previously recorded to sga expense as we adjusted our stock option forfeiture estimates to our actual forfeiture experience sga expense was also higher due to an approximate 5600 increase in management incentive costs as 2009 incentive 

  plans were limited to payouts of 50 of incentive earned while no similar restrictions are imposed on 2010 incentive compensation in addition sga expenses were impacted by an approximate 7600 increase in selling and marketing costs year over year due primarily to an approximate 5700 increase in advertising and model home costs attributable in part to an increase in the average number of active communities to 371 communities in 2010 from 355 communities in 2009 

sga expenses in 2009 decreased approximately 75600 compared to 2008 but increased slightly as a percentage of revenue to 87 in 2009 from 85 in 2008 the decrease in sga expenses was primarily attributable to a 36300 decrease in selling and marketing costs in 2009 compared to 2008 due to a 17 decrease in the average number of active communities year over year to 355 in 2009 from 427 in 2008 in addition personnel costs were down approximately 26900 due primarily to 24 decrease in average staffing levels year over year 

consolidated homebuilding backlog 

backlog units and dollars decreased approximately 17 to 2916 and 11 to 958287 respectively as of december 31 2010 compared to 3531 and 1076437 as of december 31 2009 the decrease in backlog units was primarily attributable to the increased settlement activity in 2010 as discussed above backlog dollars were negatively impacted by the decrease in backlog units 

backlog which represents homes sold but not yet settled with the customer may be impacted by customer cancellations for various reasons that are beyond our control such as failure to obtain mortgage financing inability to sell an existing home job loss or a variety of other reasons in any period a portion of the cancellations that we experience are related to new sales that occurred during the same period and a portion are related to sales that occurred in prior periods and therefore appeared in the opening backlog for the current period expressed as the total of all cancellations during the period as a percentage of gross sales during the period our cancellation rate was approximately 14 in both 2010 and 2009 and 23 in 2008 during 2010 2009 and 2008 approximately 6 7 and 10 of a reporting quarter’s opening backlog cancelled during the fiscal quarter respectively we can provide no assurance that our historical cancellation rates are indicative of the actual cancellation rate that may occur in future periods see “risk factors” in item 1a of this report 

backlog units and dollars were 3531 and 1076437 respectively as of december 31 2009 compared to 3164 and 1002795 as of december 31 2008 net new order and settlement activity during 2009 resulted in the increase in backlog units year over year the 7 increase in backlog dollars was primarily attributable to the 12 increase in backlog units offset partially by a 4 decrease in the average price of homes in ending backlog 

consolidated homebuilding — other charges 

we reassessed our goodwill and intangible asset balances for impairment in the fourth quarter of 2008 as a result of the continuing declines in new orders and backlog in 2008 and the continuing deterioration of the homebuilding environment in each of our markets spurred further in 2008 by the credit crisis in the latter part of 2008 as a result of that assessment we determined that the goodwill and intangible assets related to our rymarc homes and fox ridge homes operations were fully impaired and we wroteoff a total of 11686 related to such assets in 2008 we completed the annual assessment of the intangible asset balance in 2010 and 2009 and determined that there was no impairment see note 1 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements included herein for further discussion of intangible assets 

reportable homebuilding segments 

homebuilding profit before tax includes all revenues and income generated from the sale of homes less the cost of homes sold sga expenses and a corporate capital allocation charge determined at the corporate headquarters the corporate capital allocation charge eliminates in consolidation is based on the segment’s average net assets employed and is charged using a consistent methodology in the years presented the corporate capital allocation charged to the operating segment allows the chief operating decision maker to determine whether the operating segment’s results are providing the desired rate of return after covering our cost 

  of capital we record charges on contract land deposits when we determine that it is probable that recovery of the deposit is impaired for segment reporting purposes impairments on contract land deposits are generally charged to the operating segment upon the determination to terminate a finished lot purchase agreement with the developer or to restructure a lot purchase agreement resulting in the forfeiture of the deposit we evaluate our entire net contract land deposit portfolio for impairment each quarter for additional information regarding our contract land deposit impairment analysis see the critical accounting policies section within this management discussion and analysis for presentation purposes below the contract land deposit reserve at december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively has been allocated to the reportable segments to show contract land deposits on a net basis the net contract land deposit balances below also includes approximately 6600 4900 and 5400 at december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively of letters of credit issued as deposits in lieu of cash the following tables summarize certain homebuilding operating activity by reportable segment for each of the last three years

mid atlantic 

2010 versus 2009 

the mid atlantic segment had an approximate 23600 or 13 increase in segment profit in 2010 compared to 2009 revenues increased approximately 119300 or 7 in 2010 from 2009 on a 7 increase in the number of units settled the increase in units settled was attributable to the impact of the federal homebuyer tax credit which we believe resulted in higher first quarter sales and increased settlements through the second quarter of 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009 in addition 2010 settlements were also favorably impacted by a 5 higher beginning backlog unit balance entering 2010 as compared to 2009 the segment’s 

  gross profit margin percentage increased to 190 in 2010 from 185 in 2009 segment profit and gross profit margins were favorably impacted by lower contract land deposit impairment charges in 2010 of 9150 or 51 basis points compared to 18425 or 111 basis points in 2009 

segment new orders in 2010 declined approximately 1 while the average sales price of new orders in 2010 increased approximately 5 as compared to new orders and the average sales price in 2009 the increase in the average price of new orders was attributable to a product mix shift away from our attached products to our detached product which generally sell at higher price points 

2009 versus 2008 

the mid atlantic segment had an approximate 82200 or 79 increase in segment profit in 2009 compared to 2008 revenues for the mid atlantic segment which represents approximately 62 of total homebuilding revenues for the year decreased approximately 500500 or 23 in 2009 compared to 2008 revenues declined due to a 10 or 518 unit decrease in units settled and a 15 decrease in the average settlement price of homes in 2009 compared to 2008 the decrease in units settled is attributable to a 35 or 950 unit lower backlog balance at the beginning of 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 offset partially by a higher backlog turnover rate year over year the decrease in the average settlement price was primarily attributable to a 17 lower average price of homes in the beginning backlog year over year coupled with a 9 decline in the average sales price of new orders for the first six months of 2009 as compared to the same period in 2008 the segment’s gross profit margin percentage increased to 185 in 2009 from 136 in 2008 gross profit margins were favorably impacted by lower contract land deposit impairment charges in 2009 of 18425 or 111 basis points compared to 81834 or 379 basis points in 2008 gross profit margins in 2009 were also favorably impacted as a result of us exiting poor performing communities in 2008 which were producing lower gross profit margins in addition 2009 gross profit margins as well as segment profit were favorably impacted by lower lumber and certain other commodity costs as well as by cost control measures taken in prior quarters reducing material and personnel costs 

segment new orders in 2009 increased 12 from 2008 while the segment’s average sales price of new orders decreased 7 year over year new orders were favorably impacted in part by a 43 increase in the number of new orders in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 as a result of the significant impact of the fourth quarter 2008 credit crisis on the homebuilding market new orders were also favorably impacted in 2009 by a decrease in the cancellation rate in 2009 to 14 from 24 during 2008 in addition we believe that the federal tax credit for firsttime homebuyers had a favorable impact on new orders in 2009 as firsttime homebuyers made up a higher percentage of our total sales in the segment year over year 

north east 

2010 versus 2009 

the north east segment had an approximate 5500 or 28 increase in segment profit in 2010 compared to 2009 revenues increased approximately 32900 or 13 in 2010 from 2009 revenues increased due to a 4 increase in the number of units settled and an 8 increase in the average settlement price year over year the increase in units settled was primarily attributable to the impact of the federal homebuyer tax credit which we believe resulted in higher first quarter sales and increased settlements through the second quarter of 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009 the increase in the average settlement price resulted from a product mix shift away from our attached products to our detached product which generally sells at higher price points gross profit margins remained relatively flat period over period as the higher contract land deposit impairment charges in 2010 of 4898 or 170 basis points compared to 2009 of 2489 or 98 basis points were offset by improved leveraging of fixed operating costs due to higher settlement volume year over year 

segment new orders in 2010 decreased 9 compared to 2009 while the average sales price of new orders increased 8 year over year subsequent to the april 30 2010 expiration of the federal homebuyer tax credit we experienced a decline in new orders in each quarter of 2010 as compared to the respective quarters of 

  2009 the average sales price of new orders has been favorably impacted by a product mix shift away from our attached products to our detached product which generally sells at higher price points 

2009 versus 2008 

the north east segment had an approximate 6400 or 49 increase in segment profit in 2009 compared to 2008 despite a decrease in revenues of approximately 92500 or 27 year over year the decline in revenues was due to a 19 or 204 unit decrease in the number of units settled and a 10 decrease in the average settlement price year over year the decrease in the number of units settled and the average settlement price was primarily attributable to a 40 or 202 unit lower beginning backlog balance entering 2009 compared to 2008 and 15 lower average price of homes in beginning backlog year over year gross profit margins increased to 166 in 2009 from 134 in 2008 the increase in gross margins was attributable primarily to lower contract land deposit impairment charges in 2009 of 2489 or 98 basis points compared to 2008 of 11190 or 322 basis points in addition 2009 gross profit margins as well as segment profit were favorably impacted by lower lumber and certain other commodity costs as well as by cost control measures taken in prior quarters reducing material and personnel costs 

segment new orders in 2009 increased 2 from 2008 while the segment’s average sales price for new orders decreased 2 year over year new orders were favorably impacted in part by a 26 increase in the number of new orders in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 as a result of the significant impact of the fourth quarter 2008 credit crisis on the homebuilding market we believe new orders were also favorably impacted in 2009 by the federal tax credit for firsttime homebuyers and by a decrease in the cancellation rate to 15 in 2009 from 20 in 2008 

mid east 

2010 versus 2009 

the mid east segment had an approximate 18900 or 50 increase in segment profit in 2010 compared to 2009 the increase in segment profit was driven by an increase in revenues of approximately 126900 or 25 in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to a 24 increase in the number of units settled year over year the increase in units settled was attributable to the impact of the federal homebuyer tax credit which we believe resulted in higher first quarter sales and increased settlements through the second quarter of 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009 in addition settlements were favorably impacted by a 31 higher beginning backlog entering 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 gross profit margins remained relatively flat year over year at 173 in 2010 compared to 170 in 2009 

segment new orders and the average new order selling price in 2010 increased 4 and 2 respectively compared to 2009 new orders were favorably impacted primarily by the 178 new orders in the current year in indianapolis in market which began operations in the fourth quarter of 2009 this increase was offset partially by an increase in the cancellation rate in both the third and fourth quarters of 2010 to 21 in each quarter as compared to 15 and 13 in the third and fourth quarters of 2009 respectively 

2009 versus 2008 

the mid east segment had an approximate 1600 or 4 decrease in segment profit and an approximate 154200 or 23 decrease in revenues in 2009 compared to 2008 revenues decreased due to a 16 or 439 unit decrease in the number of units settled and a 9 decrease in the average settlement price period over period the decreases in the number of units settled and the average settlement price were primarily attributable to a 34 or 382 unit lower beginning backlog balance and 9 lower average price of homes in beginning backlog year over year respectively in addition average settlement prices were negatively impacted by a 10 decline in the average sales price of new orders for the first six months of 2009 as compared to the same period in 2008 gross profit margins increased year over year as cost reduction measures initiated in prior periods offset the decrease in the average settlement price in 2009 compared to 2008 gross profit margins in 2009 were also favorably impacted as a result of us exiting poor performing communities in 2008 which were producing lower gross profit margins 

  segment new orders in 2009 increased 7 from 2008 while the segment’s average sales price for new orders decreased 5 year over year new orders were favorably impacted in part by a 51 increase in the number of new orders in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 as a result of the significant impact of the fourth quarter 2008 credit crisis on the homebuilding market we believe new orders in 2009 were also favorably impacted by the federal tax credit for firsttime homebuyers and a decrease in the cancellation rate to 14 in 2009 from 18 in 2008 despite a reduction in the average number of active communities year over year new order average sale prices continued to be negatively impacted by market conditions which required us to alter our product offerings and reduce prices in each market within this segment 

south east 

2010 versus 2009 

the south east segment had an approximate 3500 increase in segment profit in 2010 compared to 2009 the increase in segment profit was driven by an increase of approximately 18200 or 7 in revenues in 2010 from 2009 due primarily to a 6 increase in the number of units settled the increase in units settled was primarily attributable to the impact of the federal homebuyer tax credit which we believe resulted in higher first quarter sales and increased settlements through the second quarter of 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009 in addition settlements were favorably impacted by an 8 higher beginning backlog entering 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 gross profit margins increased to 147 in 2010 from 139 in 2009 due in part to lower contract land deposit impairment charges in 2010 of 4618 or 165 basis points compared to 5236 or 200 basis points in 2009 coupled with improved leveraging of fixed operating costs due to higher settlement volume year over year 

segment new orders and the average sales price of new orders for 2010 remained relatively flat with 2009 new orders were favorably impacted by an 18 increase in the average number of active communities year over year and by the increase of approximately 80 new orders in 2010 in the orlando fl and raleigh nc markets in which we began operations in the third quarter of 2009 these favorable variances were offset by higher cancellations rates in the segment in both the third and fourth quarters of 2010 of 32 and 19 respectively compared to 14 and 18 for the respective quarters of 2009 and lower absorption rates year over year market conditions continued to deteriorate in this segment throughout 2010 the challenging market conditions coupled with the expiration of the federal homebuyer tax credit in april of 2010 attributed to the segment’s higher cancellation rates and fewer new orders in each the second third and fourth quarters of 2010 as compared to the respective quarters in 2009 we believe we will continue to face significant new order and sales pricing pressure in many of our markets in the south east segment over the next several quarters due to continuing difficult market conditions 

2009 versus 2008 

the south east segment had an approximate 500 or 7 decrease in segment profit and an approximate 208000 or 44 decrease in revenues in 2009 compared to 2008 revenues decreased primarily due to a 33 or 538 unit decrease in the number of units settled and a 17 decrease in the average settlement price year over year the decrease in units settled was attributable to a 56 or 447 unit lower beginning backlog balance entering 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 coupled with a 25 or 203 unit decrease in new orders during the first six months of 2009 as compared to the first six months of 2008 the decrease in the average settlement price was primarily attributable to a 16 lower average price of units in backlog entering 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 coupled with a 16 decline in the average sales price of new orders for the first six months of 2009 as compared to the same period in 2008 gross profit margins increased to 139 in 2009 from 128 in 2008 gross profit margins were favorably impacted by lower contract land deposit impairment charges in 2009 of 5236 or 200 basis points compared to 20081 or 427 basis points in 2008 this favorable impact on gross profit margins year over year was partially offset by a 12 decline in average new order sales prices in 2009 from 2008 as the south east segment market conditions were more challenging than those seen in our other market segments 

  segment new orders and the average new order sales price decreased 5 and 12 respectively in 2009 compared to 2008 new orders have been negatively impacted by a 23 decrease in the average number of active communities year over year in addition the challenging market conditions in the south east segment had continued to negatively impact both new orders and new order sales prices we believe new orders were favorably impacted in 2009 by the federal tax credit for firsttime homebuyers and by a decrease in cancellation rates to 15 in 2009 from 29 in 2008 

homebuilding segment reconciliations to consolidated homebuilding operations 

in addition to the corporate capital allocation and contract land deposit impairments discussed above the other reconciling items between homebuilding segment profit and homebuilding consolidated profit before tax include unallocated corporate overhead which includes all management incentive compensation stock option compensation expense goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges consolidation adjustments and external corporate interest expense our overhead functions such as accounting treasury human resources etc are centrally performed and the costs are not allocated to our operating segments consolidation adjustments consist of such items to convert the reportable segments’ results which are predominantly maintained on a cash basis to a full accrual basis for external financial statement presentation purposes and are not allocated to our operating segments likewise stock option compensation expense and goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges are not charged to the operating segments external corporate interest expense is primarily comprised of interest charges on our senior notes and is not charged to the operating segments because the charges are included in the corporate capital allocation discussed above

  mortgage banking segment 

we conduct our mortgage banking activity through nvr mortgage finance inc “nvrm” a wholly owned subsidiary nvrm focuses almost exclusively on serving the homebuilding segment’s customer base following is a table of financial and statistical data for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 

 

2010 versus 2009 

loan closing volume for the year ended december 31 2010 increased 8 from 2009 the 2010 increase was primarily attributable to a 7 increase in the number of units closed and a 1 increase in the average loan amount year over year the increases in the number of units closed and the average loan amount are attributable to the aforementioned increase in the homebuilding segment’s number of units settled and the increase in the average settlement prices in 2010 as compared to 2009 

segment profit for the year ended december 31 2010 decreased approximately 2400 from 2009 the decrease in segment profit was primarily attributable to an approximately 5800 increase in general and administrative expenses the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of a 6000 increase in the provision for loan loss compared to 2009 the 5800 increase in general and administrative expenses was partially offset by an approximate 2500 increase in interest income primarily as a result of the change in our loan sale distribution channels refer to mortgage bankingother section below for additional information 

2009 versus 2008 

loan closing volume for the year ended december 31 2009 decreased 12 from 2008 the 2009 decrease was primarily attributable to a 7 decrease in the number of units closed and a 6 decrease in the average loan amount year over year these decreases are attributable to the aforementioned decrease in the homebuilding segment’s number of units settled and the decrease in the average settlement prices in 2009 as compared to 2008 the aforementioned decrease in builder settlements in 2009 compared to 2008 was partially offset by a 6 percentage point increase in the number of loans closed by nvrm for our homebuyers who obtain a mortgage to purchase the home “capture rate” which increased to 91 for the period ended december 31 2009 compared to 85 for the same period in 2008 

  segment profit for the year ended december 31 2009 increased approximately 8900 from 2008 the increase was partially attributable to an approximate 6000 increase in mortgage banking fees which was primarily the result of a decrease in incentives the increase was partially offset by a decrease in fees attributable to the aforementioned decrease in closed loan volume the increase in mortgage banking fees for the year ended december 31 2009 was also partially attributable to an approximate 440 increase in unrealized income from the fair value measurement of our locked loan commitments forward mortgagebacked securities sales and closed loans held for sale which is included in mortgage banking fees the fair value calculations are classified as level 2 observable inputs as defined by gaap refer to note 11 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information the aforementioned fair value measurements will be impacted in the future by the change in the value of the servicing rights and the change in volume and product mix of our closed loans and locked loan commitments 

the increase in segment profit for the year ended december 31 2009 was also partially attributable to an approximate 4400 decrease in general and administrative expenses compared to the same period for 2008 the decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of a decrease in salary and other personnel costs primarily as the result of an approximate 24 decrease in staffing compared to the same period for 2008 

mortgage banking — other 

we sell all of the loans we originate into the secondary mortgage market insofar as we underwrite our originated loans to the standards and specifications of the ultimate investor we have no further financial obligations from the issuance of loans except in certain limited instances where early payment default occurs those underwriting standards are typically equal to or more stringent than the underwriting standards required by fnma va and fha nvrm has always maintained an allowance for losses on mortgage loans originated that reflects our judgment of the present loss exposure in the loans that we have originated and sold the allowance is calculated based on an analysis of historical experience and anticipated losses on mortgages held for investment real estate owned and specific expected loan repurchases or indemnifications for the period january 1 2005 to december 31 2010 we have originated approximately 17200000 of mortgage loans and have cumulative actual charges incurred related to mortgage indemnifications and repurchases of approximately 5400 during that period it has been reported that investors have become increasingly aggressive in looking for any type of underwriting deficiency incurred on loans that have gone into default to force the seller or the originator of the loans to assume any losses incurred on the defaulted loans we have not experienced an abnormal increase in the number of loans that we have been requested to either repurchase or provide indemnification for losses because we sell all of our loans and do not service them there is often a substantial delay between the time that a loan goes into default and the time that the servicer requests us to reimburse them for losses incurred because of the default we believe that all of the loans that we originate are underwritten to the standards and specifications of the ultimate investor to whom we sell our originated loans we employ a quality control department to ensure that our underwriting controls are effective and further assess the underwriting function as part of our assessment of internal controls over financial reporting at december 31 2010 we had an allowance for loan losses of approximately 8200 although we consider the allowance for loan losses reflected on the december 31 2010 balance sheet to be adequate there can be no assurance that this allowance will prove to be adequate to cover losses on loans previously originated 

nvrm continues to manage its interest rate risk by entering into optional or mandatory delivery forward sale contracts to sell whole loans and mortgagebacked securities to brokerdealers to mitigate the effect of the interest rate risk inherent in providing rate lock commitments to our borrowers however in april 2010 nvrm changed the method by which we deliver loans into our sale distribution channels in order to increase our profitability while loans are still typically sold to investors within 30 days of settlement the change has resulted in loans remaining in inventory for a longer period of time than under our previous loan sale channels this change has resulted in an increase in the mortgages held for sale balance included in the consolidated balance sheet for december 31 2010 compared to previous years and in the related interest income 

  nvrm is dependent on our homebuilding segment’s customers for business as new orders and selling prices of the homebuilding segment decline nvrm’s operations will also be adversely affected in addition the mortgage segment’s operating results may be adversely affected in future periods due to the continued tightening and volatility of the credit markets as well as increased regulation of mortgage lending practices 

seasonality 

overall we do not experience material seasonal fluctuations in sales settlements or loan closings 

effective tax rate 

our consolidated effective tax rate in 2010 2009 and 2008 was 361 356 and 3975 respectively the lower effective tax rates in 2010 and 2009 as compared to 2008 were due to the expiration of certain tax reserves previously established the amendment of certain prior year federal and state income tax returns that we believe will result in tax refunds and changes under internal revenue code section 199 domestic manufacturing deduction that provides us the ability to obtain a larger tax benefit in addition the 2009 effective tax rate was favorably impacted by mr schar relinquishing his executive officer role with us in 2009 generating a tax benefit related to compensation expense recorded for certain outstanding option grants held by mr schar that were previously considered to be a permanent nondeductible tax difference 

recent accounting pronouncements pending adoption 

there have not been any pronouncements issued but not yet implemented that we believe will have a material impact on our financial statements see note 1 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of pronouncements adopted in 2010 

liquidity and capital resources 

lines of credit and notes payable 

our homebuilding segment has generally provided for its working capital cash requirements using cash generated from operations a shortterm unsecured working capital revolving credit facility and the public debt and equity markets effective october 27 2010 we voluntarily terminated our 300000 unsecured working capital revolving credit facility which was set to expire on december 6 2010 we currently do not intend to enter into a new credit facility however effective october 27 2010 we entered into an uncommitted collateralized letter of credit facility to issue letters of credit in our ordinary course of business see note 10 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of letters of credit 

our mortgage subsidiary nvrm provides for its mortgage origination and other operating activities using cash generated from operations as well as a revolving mortgage repurchase facility which is nonrecourse to nvr on july 30 2010 we renewed and amended our master repurchase agreement dated august 5 2008 with us bank national association as agent and representative of itself as a buyer and the other buyers thereto the “master repurchase agreement” pursuant to a second amendment to master repurchase agreement with us bank national association as agent and representative of itself as buyer “agent” and the other buyers thereto together with the master repurchase agreement the “repurchase agreement” the purpose of the repurchase agreement is to finance the origination of mortgage loans by nvrm the repurchase agreement provides for loan purchases up to 100000 subject to certain sub limits in addition the repurchase agreement provides for an accordion feature under which nvrm may request that the aggregate commitments under the repurchase agreement be increased to an amount up to 125000 the repurchase agreement expires on august 2 2011 

advances under the repurchase agreement carry a pricing rate based on the libor rate plus the libor margin or the default pricing rate as determined under the repurchase agreement provided that the pricing rate shall not be less than 45 prior to the july 30 2010 renewal date the pricing rate was based on libor plus libor margin or at nvrm’s option the balance funded rate which included credit for 

  compensating balances under the repurchase agreement we may enter into separate agreements with the buyers party to the repurchase agreement adjusting the pricing rate in effect these separate agreements do not effect the maximum aggregate commitment available under the repurchase agreement there are several restrictions on purchased loans including that they cannot be sold to others they cannot be pledged to anyone other than the agent and they cannot support any other borrowing or repurchase agreement the average pricing rate on outstanding balances at december 31 2010 was 41 the average pricing rate for amounts outstanding under the previous repurchase agreement at december 31 2009 was 41 

at december 31 2010 there was 90338 outstanding under the repurchase agreement which is included in the mortgage banking segment’s “note payable” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet amounts outstanding under the repurchase agreement are collateralized by the our mortgage loans held for sale which are included in assets in the december 31 2010 balance sheet in the accompanying consolidated financial statements there were no borrowing base limitations at december 31 2010 

the repurchase agreement contains various affirmative and negative covenants with which nvrm must comply the negative covenants include among others certain limitations on transactions involving acquisitions mergers the incurrence of debt sale of assets and creation of liens upon any of its mortgage notes additional covenants include i a tangible net worth requirement ii a minimum liquidity requirement iii a minimum tangible net worth ratio iv a minimum net income requirement and v a maximum leverage ratio requirement we were in compliance with all covenants under the repurchase agreement at december 31 2010 

on june 17 2003 we completed an offering at par for 200000 of 5 senior notes due 2010 the “senior notes” under a shelf registration statement filed in 1998 with the securities and exchange commission the “sec” the senior notes bore interest at 5 payable semiannually in arrears on june 15 and december 15 upon their maturity on june 15 2010 we redeemed the remaining 133370 in outstanding senior notes upon maturity at par 

on september 8 2008 we filed a shelf registration statement the “2008 shelf registration” with the sec to register for future offer and sale an unlimited amount of debt securities common shares preferred shares depositary shares representing preferred shares and warrants we expect to use the proceeds received from future offerings if any issued under the 2008 shelf registration for general corporate purposes this discussion of nvr’s shelf registration capacity does not constitute an offer of any securities for sale 

equity repurchases 

in addition to funding growth in our homebuilding and mortgage banking operations we historically have used a substantial portion of our excess liquidity to repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock in open market and privately negotiated transactions this ongoing repurchase activity is conducted pursuant to publicly announced board authorizations and is typically executed in accordance with the safeharbor provisions of rule 10b18 promulgated under the securities and exchange act of 1934 as amended in addition the board resolutions authorizing us to repurchase shares of our common stock specifically prohibit us from purchasing shares from our officers directors profit sharing401k plan trust or employee stock ownership plan trust the repurchase program assists us in accomplishing our primary objective creating increases in shareholder value see part ii item 5 of this form 10k for disclosure of amounts repurchased during the fourth quarter of 2010 for the year ended december 31 2010 we repurchased 644562 shares of our common stock at an aggregate purchase price of 417079 as of december 31 2010 we had 109200 available under a 300000 board approved repurchase authorization 

cash flows 

for the year ended december 31 2010 cash and cash equivalents decreased by 56400 net cash provided by operating activities was 55388 cash was provided primarily by homebuilding operations and was used to fund increases to contract land deposits the presentation of operating cash flows was reduced by 63558 which is the amount of the excess tax benefit realized from the exercise of stock options and deferred 

  compensation during 2010 and credited directly to additional paid in capital investing activities provided net cash of 212440 primarily due to the net redemption of 219535 in marketable securities at maturity during the year net cash used by financing activities was 324228 during 2010 we repurchased 644562 shares of our common stock at an aggregate purchase price of 417079 under our ongoing common stock repurchase program as discussed above in addition we redeemed the remaining outstanding 5 senior notes due 2010 totaling 133370 upon their maturity on june 15 2010 stock option exercise activity during 2010 provided 77492 in exercise proceeds and we realized 63558 in excess income tax benefits from the exercise of stock options and deferred compensation plan distributions we also increased net borrowings under the mortgage warehouse facility by 77579 due to a change in the distribution channel for the sale of mortgage loans closed as discussed previously in the mortgage banking segment discussion 

in 2009 cash and cash equivalents increased by approximately 102500 operating activities provided cash of 241642 cash was provided primarily by homebuilding operations and by an approximate 32400 decrease in mortgage loans held for sale the presentation of operating cash flows was reduced by approximately 66400 which is the amount of the excess tax benefit realized from the exercise of stock options and deferred compensation during the period and credited directly to additional paid in capital net cash used for investing activities during 2009 was 221617 for the year ended december 31 2009 which primarily resulted from the net purchase of marketable securities during 2009 the marketable securities which were debt securities issued by the us treasury and other us government corporations and agencies were classified as heldtomaturity securities and matured within one year net cash provided by financing activities during 2009 was 82482 financing cash flow was favorably impacted by approximately 78500 of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and deferred compensation and the realization of approximately 66400 in excess income tax benefits from the exercise of stock options cash was used by financing activities to reduce net borrowings under the mortgage warehouse facility by approximately 32200 and we repurchased 29950 of our 5 senior notes due 2010 at par during 2009 

in 2008 cash and cash equivalents increased by approximately 483000 operating activities provided cash of 462361 cash was provided primarily by homebuilding operations and a reduction in our homebuilding inventories of approximately 288000 due to a reduction in the number of homes under construction at the end of 2008 as compared to the same period in 2007 operating cash flow was reduced by a decrease in our customer deposits of approximately 66000 the presentation of operating cash flows was also reduced by approximately 50000 which is the amount of the excess tax benefit realized from the exercise of stock options during the period and credited directly to additional paid in capital cash used for investing activities of 5498 in 2008 was used primarily for property and equipment purchases financing activities in 2008 provided 26571 due primarily to proceeds from the exercise of stock options of approximately 52000 and the realization of approximately 50000 in excess income tax benefits from the exercise of stock options cash was used in financing activities to reduce net borrowings under the mortgage warehouse facility by approximately 39000 and to repurchase 36680 of our 5 senior notes due 2010 at a cost of approximately 36400 

at december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 the homebuilding segment had restricted cash of approximately 22889 4600 and 4500 respectively the increase in restricted cash in 2010 is primarily attributable to holding requirements related to outstanding letters of credit issued under our letter of credit agreement as discussed further in note 10 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements in addition restricted cash relates to customer deposits for certain home sales 

we believe that our current cash holdings cash generated from operations and borrowings available under our mortgage repurchase agreement and the public debt and equity markets will be sufficient to satisfy near and long term cash requirements for working capital and debt service in both our homebuilding and mortgage banking operations 

  off balance sheet arrangements 

lot acquisition strategy 

we generally do not engage in land development instead we typically acquire finished building lots at market prices from various land developers under fixed price purchase agreements that require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the agreement the deposits required under the purchase agreements are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percentage typically ranging up to 10 of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots 

we believe that our lot acquisition strategy reduces the financial requirements and risks associated with direct land ownership and land development we may at our option choose for any reason and at any time not to perform under these purchase agreements by delivering notice of our intent not to acquire the finished lots under contract our sole legal obligation and economic loss for failure to perform under these purchase agreements is limited to the amount of the deposit pursuant to the liquidated damage provision contained within the purchase agreements we do not have any financial guarantees or completion obligations and we typically do not guarantee lot purchases on a specific performance basis under these purchase agreements 

at december 31 2010 we controlled approximately 50400 lots with an aggregate purchase price of approximately 4600000 by making or committing to make deposits of approximately 180900 in the form of cash and letters of credit our entire risk of loss pertaining to the aggregate purchase price contractual commitment resulting from our nonperformance under the contracts is limited to the 180900 deposit of the 180900 deposit total approximately 174300 is in cash and approximately 6600 is in letters of credit which have been issued as of december 31 2010 subsequent to december 31 2010 we will pay approximately 43200 in additional deposits assuming that contractual development milestones are met by the developers see contractual obligations section below as of december 31 2010 we had recorded an impairment valuation allowance of approximately 73500 related to the cash deposits currently outstanding please refer to note 1 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of the contract land deposits and note 3 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of our lot acquisition strategy in relation to our accounting related to the consolidation of variable interest entities  

bonds and letters of credit 

we enter into bond or letter of credit arrangements with local municipalities government agencies or land developers to collateralize our obligations under various contracts we had approximately 38300 of contingent obligations under such agreements as of december 31 2010 inclusive of the 6600 of lot acquisition deposits in the form of letters of credit discussed above we believe we will fulfill our obligations under the related contracts and do not anticipate any material losses under these bonds or letters of credit 

mortgage commitments and forward sales 

in the normal course of business our mortgage banking segment enters into contractual commitments to extend credit to buyers of singlefamily homes with fixed expiration dates the commitments become effective when the borrowers “lockin” a specified interest rate within time frames established by us all mortgagors are evaluated for credit worthiness prior to the extension of the commitment market risk arises if interest rates move adversely between the time of the “lockin” of rates by the borrower and the sale date of the loan to a brokerdealer to mitigate the effect of the interest rate risk inherent in providing rate lock commitments to borrowers we enter into optional or mandatory delivery forward sale contracts to sell whole loans and mortgagebacked securities to brokerdealers the forward sale contracts lock in an interest rate and price for the sale of loans similar to the specific rate lock commitments we do not engage in speculative or trading derivative activities both the rate lock commitments to borrowers and the forward sale contracts to brokerdealers are undesignated derivatives and accordingly are marked to fair value through earnings at december 31 2010 there were contractual commitments to extend credit to borrowers aggregating 96265 and open forward delivery contracts aggregating 262839 please refer to note 11 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of our fair value accounting 

  contractual obligations 

our fixed noncancelable obligations as of december 31 2010 were as follows 

 

 

 critical accounting policies 

general 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported 

  amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods we continually evaluate the estimates we use to prepare the consolidated financial statements and update those estimates as necessary in general our estimates are based on historical experience on information from third party professionals and other various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances actual results could differ materially from those estimates made by management 

  homebuilding inventory 

the carrying value of inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market value cost of lots and completed and uncompleted housing units represent the accumulated actual cost of the units field construction supervisors’ salaries and related direct overhead expenses are included in inventory costs interest costs are not capitalized into inventory with the exception of land under development upon settlement the cost of the unit is expensed on a specific identification basis cost of manufacturing materials is determined on a firstin firstout basis 

sold inventory is evaluated for impairment based on the contractual selling price compared to the total estimated cost to construct unsold inventory is evaluated for impairment by analyzing recent comparable sales prices within the applicable community compared to the costs incurred to date plus the expected costs to complete any calculated impairments are recorded immediately 

  land under development and contract land deposits 

  land under development 

on a very limited basis we directly acquire raw parcels of land already zoned for its intended use to develop into finished lots land under development includes the land acquisition costs direct improvement costs capitalized interest where applicable and real estate taxes 

land under development including the land under development held by our unconsolidated joint ventures and the related joint venture investments is reviewed for potential writedowns when impairment indicators are present in addition to considering market and economic conditions we assess land under development impairments on a communitybycommunity basis analyzing as applicable current sales absorption levels recent sales’ gross profit and the dollar differential between the projected fullydeveloped cost of the lots and the current market price for lots if indicators of impairment are present for a community we perform an analysis to determine if the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts and if so impairment charges are required to be recorded if the fair value of such assets is less than their carrying amounts for those assets deemed to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets our determination of fair value is primarily based on discounting the estimated future cash flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the asset and related estimated cash flow streams we do not believe that any of the land under development all of which was acquired during 2010 is impaired at this time however there can be no assurance that we will not incur impairment charges in the future due to unanticipated adverse changes in the economy or other events adversely affecting specific markets or the homebuilding industry 

  contract land deposits 

we purchase finished lots under fixed price purchase agreements that require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the contract the deposits are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percentage of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots 

we maintain an allowance for losses on contract land deposits that reflects our judgment of the present loss exposure in the existing contract land deposit portfolio at the end of the reporting period to analyze contract land deposit impairments we utilize a loss contingency analysis that is conducted each quarter in 

  addition to considering market and economic conditions we assess contract land deposit impairments on a communitybycommunity basis pursuant to the purchase contract terms analyzing as applicable current sales absorption levels recent sales’ gross profit the dollar differential between the contractual purchase price and the current market price for lots a developer’s financial stability a developer’s financial ability or willingness to reduce lot prices to current market prices and the contract’s default status by either us or the developer along with an analysis of the expected outcome of any such default 

our analysis is focused on whether we can sell houses profitably in a particular community in the current market with which we are faced because we don’t own the finished lots on which we had placed a contract land deposit if the above analysis leads to a determination that we can’t sell homes profitably at the current contractual lot price we then determine whether we will elect to default under the contract forfeit our deposit and terminate the contract or whether we will attempt to restructure the lot purchase contract which may require us to forfeit the deposit to obtain contract concessions from a developer we also assess whether an impairment is present due to collectability issues resulting from a developer’s nonperformance because of financial or other conditions 

although we consider the allowance for losses on contract land deposits reflected on the december 31 2010 balance sheet to be adequate see note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included herein there can be no assurance that this allowance will prove to be adequate over time to cover losses due to unanticipated adverse changes in the economy or other events adversely affecting specific markets or the homebuilding industry

reorganization value in excess of identifiable assets “excess reorganization value” is an indefinite life intangible asset that was created upon our emergence from bankruptcy on september 30 1993 based on the allocation of our reorganization value the portion of our reorganization value which was not attributed to specific tangible or intangible assets has been reported as excess reorganization value which is treated similarly to goodwill excess reorganization value is not subject to amortization rather excess reorganization value is subject to an impairment assessment on an annual basis or more frequently if changes in events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred because excess reorganization value was based on the reorganization value of our entire enterprise upon bankruptcy emergence the impairment assessment is conducted on an enterprise basis based on the comparison of our total equity compared to the market value of our outstanding publiclytraded common stock we do not believe that excess reorganization value is impaired at this time however changes in strategy or continued adverse changes in market conditions could impact this judgment and require an impairment loss to be recognized if our book value including excess reorganization value exceeds the fair value 

  warranty  product liability accruals 

warranty and product liability accruals are established to provide for estimated future costs as a result of construction and product defects product recalls and litigation incidental to our business liability estimates are determined based on our judgment considering such factors as historical experience the likely current cost of corrective action manufacturers’ and subcontractors’ participation in sharing the cost of corrective action consultations with third party experts such as engineers and evaluations by our general counsel and outside counsel retained to handle specific product liability cases although we consider the warranty and product liability accrual reflected on the december 31 2010 balance sheet to be adequate see note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included herein there can be no assurance that this accrual will prove to be adequate over time to cover losses due to increased costs for material and labor the inability or refusal of manufacturers or subcontractors to financially participate in corrective action unanticipated adverse legal settlements or other unanticipated changes to the assumptions used to estimate the warranty and product liability accrual 

    stockbased compensation expense 

compensation costs related to our stock based compensation plans are recognized within our income statement the costs recognized are based on the grant date fair value compensation cost for sharebased grants is recognized on a straightline basis over the requisite service period for the entire award from the date of grant through the period of the last separately vesting portion of the grant 

we calculate the fair value of our nonpublicly traded employee stock options using the blackscholes optionpricing model while the blackscholes model is a widely accepted method to calculate the fair value of options its results are dependent on input variables two of which expected term and expected volatility are significantly dependent on management’s judgment we have concluded that our historical exercise experience is the best estimate of future exercise patterns to determine an option’s expected term to estimate expected volatility we analyze the historical volatility of our common stock over a period equal to the option’s expected term changes in management’s judgment of the expected term and the expected volatility could have a material effect on the grantdate fair value calculated and expensed within the income statement in addition we are required to estimate future grant forfeitures when considering the amount of stockbased compensation costs to record we have concluded that our historical forfeiture rate is the best measure to base our estimate of future forfeitures of equitybased compensation grants however there can be no assurance that our future forfeiture rate will not be materially higher or lower than our historical forfeiture rate which would affect the aggregate cumulative compensation expense recognized 

  mortgage loan loss allowance 

we originate several different loan products to our customers to finance the purchase of their home we sell all of the loans we originate into the secondary mortgage market generally within 30 days from origination all of the loans that we originate are underwritten to the standards and specifications of the ultimate investor those underwriting standards are typically equal to or more stringent than the underwriting standards required by fnma va and fha insofar as we underwrite our originated loans to those standards we bear no increased concentration of credit risk from the issuance of loans except in certain limited instances where early payment default occurs we employ a quality control department to ensure that our underwriting controls are effectively operating and further assess the underwriting function as part of our assessment of internal controls over financial reporting we maintain an allowance for losses on mortgage loans originated that reflects our judgment of the present loss exposure in the loans that we have originated and sold the allowance is calculated based on an analysis of historical experience and anticipated losses on mortgages held for investment real estate owned and specific expected loan repurchases or indemnifications although we consider the allowance for loan losses reflected on the december 31 2010 balance sheet to be adequate see note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included herein there can be no assurance that this allowance will prove to be adequate over time to cover losses due to unanticipated changes to the assumptions used to estimate the mortgage loan loss allowance

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates our market risk arises from interest rate risk inherent in our financial instruments interest rate risk results from the possibility that changes in interest rates will cause unfavorable changes in net income or in the value of interest ratesensitive assets liabilities and commitments lower interest rates tend to increase demand for mortgage loans for home purchasers while higher interest rates make it more difficult for potential borrowers to purchase residential properties and to qualify for mortgage loans we have no market rate sensitive instruments held for speculative or trading purposes 

  our mortgage banking segment is exposed to interest rate risk as it relates to its lending activities the mortgage banking segment originates mortgage loans which are sold through either optional or mandatory forward delivery contracts into the secondary markets all of the mortgage banking segment’s loan portfolio is held for sale and subject to forward sale commitments nvrm also sells all of its mortgage servicing rights on a servicing released basis 

nvrm generates operating liquidity primarily through the mortgage repurchase agreement which provides for loan repurchases up to 100000 subject to certain sub limits the repurchase agreement is used to fund nvrm’s mortgage origination activities advances under the repurchase agreement carry a pricing rate based on the libor rate plus the libor margin or the default pricing rate as determined under the repurchase agreement provided that the pricing rate shall not be less than 45 under the repurchase agreement we may enter into separate agreements with the buyers party to the repurchase agreement adjusting the pricing rate in effect the average pricing rate on outstanding balances at december 31 2010 was 41 

the following table represents the contractual balances of our onbalance sheet financial instruments at the expected maturity dates as well as the fair values of those onbalance sheet financial instruments at december 31 2010 the expected maturity categories take into consideration the actual and anticipated amortization of principal and do not take into consideration the reinvestment of cash or the refinancing of existing indebtedness because we sell all of the mortgage loans we originate into the secondary markets we have made the assumption that the portfolio of mortgage loans held for sale will mature in the first year consequently advances outstanding under the repurchase agreement are also assumed to mature in the first year

 item 1 business 

general 

nvr inc “nvr” was formed in 1980 as nvhomes inc our primary business is the construction and sale of singlefamily detached homes townhomes and condominium buildings to more fully serve customers of our homebuilding operations we also operate a mortgage banking and title services business we conduct our homebuilding activities directly our mortgage banking operations are operated primarily through a wholly owned subsidiary nvr mortgage finance inc “nvrm” unless the context otherwise requires references to “nvr” “we” “us” or “our” include nvr and its consolidated subsidiaries 

we are one of the largest homebuilders in the united states while we operate in multiple locations in fourteen states primarily in the eastern part of the united states approximately 38 of our home settlements in 2009 occurred in the washington dc and baltimore md metropolitan areas which accounted for 48 of our 2009 homebuilding revenues our homebuilding operations include the construction and sale of singlefamily detached homes townhomes and condominium buildings under four trade names ryan homes nvhomes fox ridge homes and rymarc homes the ryan homes fox ridge homes and rymarc homes products are marketed primarily to firsttime homeowners and firsttime moveup buyers the ryan homes product is currently sold in twentyfive metropolitan areas located in maryland virginia west virginia pennsylvania new york north carolina south carolina ohio new jersey delaware kentucky indiana and florida the fox ridge homes product is sold solely in the nashville tn metropolitan area and the rymarc homes product is sold solely in the columbia sc metropolitan area the nvhomes product is marketed primarily to moveup and upscale buyers and is sold in the washington dc baltimore md philadelphia pa and the maryland eastern shore metropolitan areas in 2009 our average price of a settled unit was approximately 296000 

we do not engage in land development instead we typically acquire finished building lots at market prices from various development entities under fixed price purchase agreements “purchase agreements” that require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the purchase agreement the deposits required under the purchase agreements are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percentage typically ranging up to 10 of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots 

we believe that our lot acquisition strategy avoids the financial requirements and risks associated with direct land ownership and land development we may at our option choose for any reason and at any time not to perform under these purchase agreements by delivering notice of our intent not to acquire the finished lots under contract our sole legal obligation and economic loss for failure to perform under these purchase agreements is limited to the amount of the deposit pursuant to the liquidating damage provision contained within the purchase agreements we do not have any financial guarantees or completion obligations and we typically do not guarantee lot purchases on a specific performance basis under these purchase agreements we generally seek to maintain control over a supply of lots believed to be suitable to meet our fiveyear business plan 

on a limited basis we also obtain finished lots using joint venture limited liability corporations “llcs” all llcs are typically structured such that we are a noncontrolling member and are at risk only for the amount we have invested we are not a borrower guarantor or obligor on any of the llcs debt we enter into a standard fixed price purchase agreement to purchase lots from these llcs at december 31 2009 we had an aggregate investment totaling approximately 25 million in ten separate llcs as of december 31 2009 eight of these llcs were nonperforming and as a result we had recorded an impairment reserve equal to our total investment of approximately 3 million in these llcs due to our determination that our investment was not recoverable we do not expect to obtain any lots from these eight llcs in future periods in the two performing llcs our aggregate investment totaled 22 million and we controlled approximately 760 lots at december 31 2009 we had additional funding commitments totaling 4 million to one of the two performing llcs 

in addition to building and selling homes we provide a number of mortgagerelated services through our mortgage banking operations through operations in each of our homebuilding markets nvrm originates mortgage loans almost exclusively for our homebuyers nvrm generates revenues primarily from origination fees gains on sales of loans and title fees nvrm sells all of the mortgage loans it closes into the secondary markets on a servicing released basis 

segment information for our homebuilding and mortgage banking businesses is included in note 2 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

current business environment 

during 2009 the homebuilding environment in certain markets began to exhibit some stabilization after several years of declining sales and selling prices despite this stabilization the homebuilding market remains challenging and many market uncertainties remain due to the continuing economic recession homebuyer confidence continues to be negatively impacted by concerns regarding job stability driven by historically high unemployment rates slowed demand and high foreclosure rates have contributed to high levels of existing and new homes available for sale the sales of new and existing homes also continue to be adversely impacted by a tighter mortgage lending environment that has made it more difficult for our customers to obtain mortgage financing in addition significant future uncertainties remain as to certain of the government’s stimulus programs which we believe helped to stabilize home prices as the federal tax credit for first time and moveup buyers and the federal reserve’s purchases of mortgagebacked securities are expected to end in 2010 the termination of those programs may lead to a decline in demand and higher mortgage interest rates for additional information and analysis of recent trends in our operations and financial condition see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 of this form 10k 

homebuilding 

  products 

we offer singlefamily detached homes townhomes and condominium buildings with many different basic home designs these home designs have a variety of elevations and numerous other options our homes combine traditional or colonial exterior designs with contemporary interior designs and amenities generally include two to four bedrooms and range from approximately 1000 to 7300 square feet during 2009 the prices at which we settled homes ranged from approximately 56000 to 2000000 and averaged approximately 296000 during 2008 our average price was approximately 338000 

  markets 

our four reportable homebuilding segments operate in the following geographic regions 

 

further discussion of settlements new orders and backlog activity by homebuilding reportable segment for each of the last three years can be found in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 of this form 10k 

  backlog 

backlog totaled 3531 units and approximately 11 billion at december 31 2009 compared to backlog of 3164 units and approximately 10 billion at december 31 2008 backlog which represents homes sold but not yet settled with the customer may be impacted by customer cancellations for various reasons that are beyond our control such as failure to obtain mortgage financing inability to sell an existing home job loss or a variety of other reasons in any period a portion of the cancellations that we experience are related to new sales that occurred during the same period and a portion are related to sales that occurred in prior periods and therefore appeared in the opening backlog for the current period expressed as the total of all cancellations during the period as a percentage of gross sales during the period our cancellation rate was approximately 14 23 and 21 in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively during 2009 and 2008 approximately 7 and 10 of a reporting quarter’s opening backlog cancelled during the fiscal quarter respectively we can provide no assurance that our historical cancellation rates are indicative of the actual cancellation rate that may occur in 2010 see “risk factors” in item 1a 

  construction 

we utilize independent subcontractors under fixed price contracts to perform construction work on our homes the subcontractors’ work is performed under the supervision of our employees who monitor quality control we use several independent subcontractors in our various markets and we are not dependent on any single subcontractor or on a small number of subcontractors 

  land development 

we do not engage in land development instead we typically purchase finished lots from various land developers under fixed price purchase agreements that require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the agreement the deposits required under the purchase agreements are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percentage typically ranging up to 10 of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots we are not dependent on any single developer or on a small number of developers 

  sales and marketing 

our preferred marketing method is for customers to visit a furnished model home featuring many builtin options and a landscaped lot the garages of these model homes are usually converted into temporary sales centers where alternative facades and floor plans are displayed and designs for other models are available for review sales representatives are compensated predominantly on a commission basis 

  regulation 

we and our subcontractors must comply with various federal state and local zoning building environmental advertising and consumer credit statutes rules and regulations as well as other regulations and requirements in connection with our construction and sales activities all of these regulations have increased the cost to produce and market our products and in some instances have delayed our developers’ abilities to deliver us finished lots counties and cities in which we build homes have at times declared moratoriums on the issuance of building permits and imposed other restrictions in the areas in which sewage treatment facilities and other public facilities do not reach minimum standards to date restrictive zoning laws and the imposition of moratoriums have not had a material adverse effect on our construction activities however in certain markets in which we operate we believe that our growth has been hampered by the longer time periods necessary for our developers to obtain the necessary governmental approvals 

  competition and market factors 

the housing industry is highly competitive we compete with numerous homebuilders of varying size ranging from local to national in scope some of which have greater financial resources than we do we 

also face competition from the home resale market our homebuilding operations compete primarily on the basis of price location design quality service and reputation historically we have been one of the market leaders in each of the markets where we build homes 

the housing industry is cyclical and is affected by consumer confidence levels prevailing economic conditions and interest rates other factors that affect the housing industry and the demand for new homes include the availability and the cost of land labor and materials changes in consumer preferences demographic trends and the availability of mortgage finance programs see “risk factors” in item 1a 

we are dependent upon building material suppliers for a continuous flow of raw materials whenever possible we utilize standard products available from multiple sources in the past such raw materials have been generally available to us in adequate supply 

mortgage banking 

we provide a number of mortgage related services to our homebuilding customers through our mortgage banking operations our mortgage banking operations also include separate subsidiaries that broker title insurance and perform title searches in connection with mortgage loan closings for which they receive commissions and fees because nvrm originates mortgage loans almost exclusively for our homebuilding customers nvrm is dependent on our homebuilding segment in 2009 nvrm closed approximately 8000 loans with an aggregate principal amount of approximately 21 billion as compared to 8600 loans with an aggregate principal amount of approximately 24 billion in 2008 

nvrm sells all of the mortgage loans it closes to investors in the secondary markets on a servicing released basis typically within 30 days from the loan closing nvrm is an approved sellerservicer for fnma gnma fhlmc va and fha mortgage loans 

  competition and market factors 

nvrm’s main competition comes from national regional and local mortgage bankers mortgage brokers thrifts and banks in each of these markets nvrm competes primarily on the basis of customer service variety of products offered interest rates offered prices of ancillary services and relative financing availability and costs 

  regulation 

nvrm is an approved sellerservicer of fnma gnma fhlmc fha and va mortgage loans and is subject to all of those agencies’ rules and regulations these rules and regulations restrict certain activities of nvrm nvrm is currently eligible and expects to remain eligible to participate in such programs in addition nvrm is subject to regulation at the state and federal level with respect to specific origination selling and servicing practices 

  pipeline 

nvrm’s mortgage loans in process that have not closed “pipeline” at december 31 2009 and 2008 had an aggregate principal balance of 770 million and 730 million respectively our cancellation rate was approximately 35 in 2009 during 2008 and 2007 nvrm’s loan cancellation rates were approximately 49 and 45 respectively we can provide no assurance that our historical loan cancellation rates are indicative of the actual loan cancellation rate that may occur in 2010 see “risk factors” in item 1a 

employees 

at december 31 2009 we employed 2688 fulltime persons of whom 981 were officers and management personnel 170 were technical and construction personnel 556 were sales personnel 462 were administrative personnel and 519 were engaged in various other service and labor activities none of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement and we have never experienced a work stoppage we believe that our employee relations are good

risk factors 

our business is affected by the risks generally incident to the residential construction business including but not limited to 

 

all of these risks are discussed in detail below 

the homebuilding industry is experiencing a significant downturn the continuation of this downturn could adversely affect our business and our results of operations 

the homebuilding industry has continued to experience a significant downturn as a result of declining consumer confidence driven by an economic recession affordability issues and uncertainty as to the stability of home prices additionally the tightening credit markets have made it more difficult for customers to obtain financing to purchase homes as a result we have experienced reduced demand for new homes our cancellation rate was approximately 14 23 and 21 during 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively these ongoing market factors have also resulted in pricing pressures and in turn lower gross profit margins in most of our markets a continued downturn in the homebuilding industry could result in a material adverse effect on our sales fewer gross sales andor higher cancellation rates profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

if the market value of our inventory or controlled lot position declines our profit could decrease and we may incur losses 

inventory risk can be substantial for homebuilders the market value of building lots and housing inventories can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing market conditions in addition inventory carrying costs can be significant and can result in losses in a poorly performing project or market we must in the ordinary course of our business continuously seek and make acquisitions of lots for expansion into new markets as well as for replacement and expansion within our current markets which is accomplished by us entering fixed price purchase agreements and paying forfeitable deposits under the purchase agreement to developers for the contractual right to acquire the lots in the event of further adverse changes in economic or market conditions we may cease further building activities in communities or restructure existing purchase agreements resulting in forfeiture of some or all of any remaining land contract deposit paid to the developer either action may result in a loss which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

if the tax credit available to first time homebuyers expires on july 1 2010 and is not renewed it may negatively impact our future sales 

as part of the federal government’s economic stimulus efforts first time homebuyers may receive an 8000 tax credit and current homeowners purchasing a replacement primary residence may receive a 6500 tax credit when filing their federal income tax return if they purchase the primary residence by april 30 2010 and settle on the home prior to july 1 2010 which is the date that the homebuyer tax credit program expires it is unclear at this time if the federal government is going to extend or expand that program past july 1 2010 this program and the prior first time homebuyer tax credit program may have stimulated our sales over the recent quarters to levels that would not have been achieved without the program being in effect further there is a possibility that the availability of the program to homebuyers pulled sales forward from future 

quarters which could lead to reduced demand in the immediate future the expiration of the first time homebuyer tax credit could result in a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

because almost all of our customers require mortgage financing the availability of suitable mortgage financing could impair the affordability of our homes lower demand for our products and limit our ability to fully deliver our backlog 

our business and earnings depend on the ability of our potential customers to obtain mortgages for the purchase of our homes in addition many of our potential customers must sell their existing homes in order to buy a home from us the tightening of credit standards and the availability of suitable mortgage financing could prevent customers from buying our homes and could prevent buyers of our customers’ homes from obtaining mortgages they need to complete that purchase both of which could result in our potential customers’ inability to buy a home from us if our potential customers or the buyers of our customers’ current homes are not able to obtain suitable financing the result could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

if our ability to sell mortgages to investors is impaired we may be required to fund these commitments ourselves or may not be able to originate loans at all 

our mortgage segment sells all of the loans it originates into the secondary market usually within 30 days from the date of closing and has up to approximately 100 million available in a repurchase agreement to fund mortgage closings in the event that disruptions to the secondary markets similar to those which occurred during 2007 and 2008 continue to tighten or eliminate the available liquidity within the secondary markets for mortgage loans or the underwriting requirements by our secondary market investors continue to become more stringent our ability to sell future mortgages could decline and we could be required among other things to fund our commitments to our buyers with our own financial resources which is limited or require our home buyers to find another source of financing in addition governmentsponsored enterprises principally fnma and fhlmc play a significant role in buying home mortgages and creating investment securities that they either sell to investors or hold in their portfolios these organizations as well as the federal reserve’s program to purchase mortgagebacked securities provide liquidity to the secondary mortgage market the effects of the government takeover of fnma and fhlmc are not yet certain and may restrict or curtail their activities and further disrupt the secondary markets in addition the federal reserve is expected to discontinue purchasing mortgagebacked securities in 2010 the result of such secondary market disruption could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

interest rate movements inflation and other economic factors can negatively impact our business 

high rates of inflation generally affect the homebuilding industry adversely because of their adverse impact on interest rates high interest rates not only increase the cost of borrowed funds to homebuilders but also have a significant effect on housing demand and on the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective purchasers we are also subject to potential volatility in the price of commodities that impact costs of materials used in our homebuilding business increases in prevailing interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

our financial results also are affected by the risks generally incident to our mortgage banking business including interest rate levels the impact of government regulation on mortgage loan originations and servicing and the need to issue forward commitments to fund and sell mortgage loans our homebuilding customers account for almost all of our mortgage banking business the volume of our continuing homebuilding operations therefore affects our mortgage banking business 

our mortgage banking business also is affected by interest rate fluctuations we also may experience marketing losses resulting from daily increases in interest rates to the extent we are unable to match interest rates and amounts on loans we have committed to originate with forward commitments from third parties to purchase such loans increases in interest rates may have a material adverse effect on our mortgage banking revenue profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

our operations may also be adversely affected by other economic factors within our markets such as negative changes in employment levels job growth and consumer confidence and availability of mortgage financing one or all of which could result in reduced demand or price depression from current levels such negative trends could have a material adverse effect on homebuilding operations 

these factors and thus the homebuilding business have at times in the past been cyclical in nature any downturn in the national economy or the local economies of the markets in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations in particular approximately 38 of our home settlements during 2009 occurred in the washington dc and baltimore md metropolitan areas which accounted for 48 of our homebuilding revenues in 2009 thus we are dependent to a significant extent on the economy and demand for housing in those areas 

our inability to secure and control an adequate inventory of lots could adversely impact our operations 

the results of our homebuilding operations are dependent upon our continuing ability to control an adequate number of homebuilding lots in desirable locations there can be no assurance that an adequate supply of building lots will continue to be available to us on terms similar to those available in the past or that we will not be required to devote a greater amount of capital to controlling building lots than we have historically an insufficient supply of building lots in one or more of our markets an inability of our developers to deliver finished lots in a timely fashion due to their inability to secure financing to fund development activities or for other reasons or our inability to purchase or finance building lots on reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

volatility in the credit and capital markets may impact our ability to access necessary financing 

our homebuilding operations are dependent in part on the availability and cost of working capital financing and may be adversely affected by a shortage or an increase in the cost of such financing if we require working capital greater than that provided by our operations and our credit facility we may be required to seek to increase the amount available under the facility or to obtain alternative financing no assurance can be given that additional or replacement financing will be available on terms that are favorable or acceptable moreover issues involving liquidity and capital adequacy affecting our lenders could in turn affect our ability to fully access our available credit facilities in addition the credit and capital markets are experiencing significant volatility that is difficult to predict if we are required to seek alternative financing to fund our working capital requirements continued volatility in these markets may restrict our flexibility to access financing if we are at any time unsuccessful in obtaining sufficient capital to fund our planned homebuilding expenditures we may experience a substantial delay in the completion of any homes then under construction or we may be unable to control or purchase finished building lots any delay could result in cost increases and could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

our mortgage banking operations are dependent on the availability cost and other terms of mortgage financing facilities and may be adversely affected by any shortage or increased cost of such financing no assurance can be given that any additional or replacement financing will be available on terms that are favorable or acceptable our mortgage banking operations are also dependent upon the securitization market for mortgagebacked securities and could be materially adversely affected by any fluctuation or downturn in such market 

our current indebtedness may impact our future operations 

our existing indebtedness contains financial and other restrictive covenants and any future indebtedness may also contain covenants these covenants include limitations on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness pay cash dividends and make distributions make loans and investments enter into transactions with affiliates effect certain asset sales incur certain liens merge or consolidate with any other person or transfer all or substantially all of our properties and assets substantial losses by us or other action or inaction by us or our subsidiaries could result in the violation of one or more of these covenants which could result in decreased liquidity or a default on our indebtedness thereby having a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

government regulations and environmental matters could negatively affect our operations 

we are subject to various local state and federal statutes ordinances rules and regulations concerning zoning building design construction and similar matters including local regulations that impose restrictive zoning and density requirements in order to limit the number of homes that can eventually be built within the boundaries of a particular area these regulations may further increase the cost to produce and market our products in addition we have from time to time been subject to and may also be subject in the future to periodic delays in our homebuilding projects due to building moratoriums in the areas in which we operate changes in regulations that restrict homebuilding activities in one or more of our principal markets could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

we are also subject to a variety of local state and federal statutes ordinances rules and regulations concerning the protection of health and the environment we are subject to a variety of environmental conditions that can affect our business and our homebuilding projects the particular environmental laws that apply to any given homebuilding site vary greatly according to the location and environmental condition of the site and the present and former uses of the site and adjoining properties environmental laws and conditions may result in delays cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs or prohibit or severely restrict homebuilding activity in certain environmentally sensitive regions or areas thereby adversely affecting our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

we are an approved sellerservicer of fnma gnma fhlmc fha and va mortgage loans and are subject to all of those agencies’ rules and regulations any significant impairment of our eligibility to sellservice these loans could have a material adverse impact on our mortgage operations in addition we are subject to regulation at the state and federal level with respect to specific origination selling and servicing practices including the real estate settlement and protection act adverse changes in governmental regulation may have a negative impact on our mortgage loan origination business 

we face competition in our housing and mortgage banking operations 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive we compete with numerous homebuilders of varying size ranging from local to national in scope some of whom have greater financial resources than we do we face competition 

 

our homebuilding operations compete primarily on the basis of price location design quality service and reputation 

the mortgage banking industry is also competitive our main competition comes from national regional and local mortgage bankers thrifts banks and mortgage brokers in each of these markets our mortgage banking operations compete primarily on the basis of customer service variety of products offered interest rates offered prices of ancillary services and relative financing availability and costs 

there can be no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully in our homebuilding or mortgage banking operations an inability to effectively compete may have an adverse impact on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

a shortage of building materials or labor or increases in materials or labor costs may adversely impact our operations 

the homebuilding business has from time to time experienced building material and labor shortages including shortages in insulation drywall certain carpentry work and concrete as well as fluctuating lumber prices and supply in addition high employment levels and strong construction market conditions could restrict the labor force available to our subcontractors and us in one or more of our markets significant increases in costs resulting from these shortages or delays in construction of homes could have a material adverse effect upon our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

product liability litigation and warranty claims may adversely impact our operations 

construction defect and home warranty claims are common and can represent a substantial risk for the homebuilding industry the cost of insuring against construction defect and product liability claims as well as the claims themselves can be high in addition insurance companies limit coverage offered to protect against these claims further restrictions on coverage availability or significant increases in premium costs or claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

we are subject to litigation proceedings that could harm our business if an unfavorable ruling were to occur 

from time to time we may become involved in litigation and other legal proceedings relating to claims arising from our operations in the normal course of business as described in but not limited to part i item 3 “legal proceedings” of this 10k we are currently subject to certain legal proceedings litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings may occur we cannot assure you that these or other litigation or legal proceedings will not materially affect our ability to conduct our business in the manner that we expect or otherwise adversely affect us should an unfavorable ruling occur 

changes in tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws may negatively affect our operating results 

the effects of possible changes in the tax laws or changes in their interpretation could have a material negative impact on our financial results 

certain of our net deferred tax assets could be substantially limited if we experience an ownership change as defined in the internal revenue code 

certain of our net deferred tax assets give rise to builtin losses “bils” our ability to utilize bils and to offset our future taxable income andor to recover previously paid taxes would be limited if we were to undergo an “ownership change” within the meaning of section 382 of the internal revenue code which we refer to as the code in general an “ownership change” occurs whenever the percentage of the stock of a corporation owned by “5percent shareholders” within the meaning of section 382 of the code increases by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of the stock of such corporation owned by such “5percent shareholders” at any time over the preceding three years 

an ownership change under section 382 of the code would establish an annual limitation on the amount of bils we could utilize to offset our taxable income in any single taxable year to an amount equal to i the product of a specified rate which is published by the us treasury and the aggregate value of our outstanding stock plus ii the amount of unutilized limitation from prior years the application of these limitations might prevent full utilization of the deferred tax assets attributable to our bils we do not believe we have experienced an ownership change as defined by section 382 and therefore we do not believe the bils are subject to any section 382 limitation however whether a change in ownership occurs in the future is largely outside of our control and there can be no assurance that such a change will not occur 

 

extreme weather or other events such as significant snowfalls hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes forest fires floods terrorist attacks or war may affect our markets our operations and our profitability these events may impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or subcontractors causing us material increases in costs or delays in construction of homes which could have a material adverse effect upon our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows

 item 2 properties 

our corporate offices are located in reston virginia where we currently lease approximately 61000 square feet of office space of which approximately 9800 square feet we have subleased to a third party the current corporate office lease expires in april 2015 

in connection with the operation of the homebuilding segment we lease manufacturing facilities in the following six locations thurmont maryland burlington county new jersey farmington new york kings mountain north carolina darlington pennsylvania and portland tennessee these facilities range in size from approximately 40000 square feet to 400000 square feet and combined total approximately 1000000 square feet of manufacturing space each of these leases contains various options for extensions of the lease and for the purchase of the facility the portland thurmont and farmington leases expire in 2014 and the kings mountain and burlington county leases expire in 2023 and 2024 respectively the darlington lease expires in 2025 due to the economic downturn and the related decline in our homebuilding activity our current plant utilization has dropped to approximately 40 of total capacity 

we also in connection with both our homebuilding and mortgage banking businesses lease office space in multiple locations for homebuilding divisional offices and mortgage banking and title services branches under leases expiring at various times through 2017 none of which are individually material to our business we anticipate that upon expiration of existing leases we will be able to renew them or obtain comparable facilities on acceptable terms 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

on july 18 2007 former and current employees filed lawsuits against the company in the court of common pleas in allegheny county pennsylvania and hamilton county ohio in superior court in durham county north carolina and in the circuit court in montgomery county maryland and on july 19 2007 in the superior court in new jersey alleging that the company incorrectly classified its sales and marketing representatives as being exempt from overtime wages these lawsuits are similar in nature to another lawsuit filed on october 29 2004 by another former employee in the united states district court for the western district of new york the complaints seek injunctive relief an award of unpaid wages including fringe benefits liquidated damages equal to the overtime wages allegedly due and not paid attorney and other fees and interest and where available multiple damages the suits were filed as purported class actions however while a number of individuals have filed consents to join and assert 

federal claims in the new york action none of the groups of employees that the lawsuits purport to represent have been certified as a class the lawsuits filed in ohio pennsylvania maryland new jersey and north carolina have been stayed pending further developments in the new york action 

the company believes that its compensation practices in regard to sales and marketing representatives are entirely lawful and in compliance with two letter rulings from the united states department of labor “dol” issued in january 2007 the two courts to most recently consider similar claims against other homebuilders have acknowledged the dol’s position that sales and marketing representatives were properly classified as exempt from overtime wages and the only court to have directly addressed the exempt status of such employees concluded that the dol’s position was valid accordingly the company has vigorously defended and intends to continue to vigorously defend these lawsuits because the company is unable to determine the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome of this case or the amount of damages if any the company has not recorded any associated liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 

nvr and its subsidiaries are also involved in various other litigation arising in the ordinary course of business in the opinion of management and based on advice of legal counsel this litigation is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial position or results of operations of nvr

overview 

business 

our primary business is the construction and sale of singlefamily detached homes townhomes and condominium buildings to fully serve customers of our homebuilding operations we also operate a mortgage banking and title services business we primarily conduct our operations in mature markets additionally we generally grow our business through market share gains in our existing markets and by expanding into markets contiguous to our current active markets our four homebuilding reportable segments consist of the following regions 

 

we believe we operate our business with a conservative operating strategy we do not engage in land development and primarily construct homes on a presold basis this strategy allows us to maximize inventory turnover which enables us to minimize market risk and to operate with less capital thereby enhancing rates of return on equity and total capital in addition we focus on obtaining and maintaining a leading market position in each market we serve this strategy allows us to gain valuable efficiencies and competitive advantages in our markets which we believe contributes to minimizing the adverse effects of regional economic cycles and provides growth opportunities within these markets 

because we do not develop land our continued success is contingent upon our ability to control an adequate supply of finished lots on which to build and on our developers’ ability to timely deliver finished lots to meet the sales demands of our customers we acquire finished building lots at market prices from various land developers under purchase agreements these purchase agreements require deposits typically ranging up to 10 of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots in the form of cash or letters of credit that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the purchase agreement however we believe that this lot acquisition strategy avoids the financial requirements and risks associated with direct land ownership and development as of december 31 2009 we controlled approximately 46300 lots with deposits in cash and letters of credit totaling approximately 140700 and 4900 respectively included in the number of controlled lots are approximately 10800 lots for which we have recorded a contract land deposit impairment reserve of approximately 89500 as of december 31 2009 see note 1 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information regarding contract land deposits 

overview of current business environment 

during 2009 the homebuilding environment began to exhibit some stabilization after several years of declining sales and selling prices despite this stabilization the homebuilding market remains challenging and many market uncertainties remain due to the continuing economic recession homebuyer confidence continues to be negatively impacted by concerns regarding job stability driven by historically high unemployment rates reduced demand and high foreclosure rates have contributed to high levels of existing and new homes available for sale the sales of new and existing homes also continue to be adversely impacted by a tighter mortgage lending environment that has made it more difficult for our customers to obtain mortgage financing as well as making it difficult to sell their current homes in addition tighter lending requirements requiring higher downpayments have negatively impacted affordability despite current market conditions and a decrease in the average number of active communities year over year new orders net of cancellations “new orders” for 2009 increased 7 from the prior year the increase in new orders was in part attributable to a 47 increase in new orders in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 a period in which we experienced a significant dropoff in new orders due to a sharp decline in overall economic conditions in addition we believe new orders during the current year were also favorably impacted by the federal tax credit for first time homebuyers as we experienced an increase in the percentage of first time homebuyers year over year new orders were also favorably impacted in 2009 by higher absorption rates in each of our market segments and by a decline in our cancellation rate to 14 from 23 in 2008 new order selling prices continued to be negatively impacted in most of our markets by the challenging market conditions leading to a 6 decline in the average new order selling price in 2009 compared to 2008 

consolidated revenues for 2009 decreased 26 to 2743848 from 3693039 in 2008 net income for 2009 was 192180 3126 per diluted share compared to net income of 100892 1704 per diluted share in 2008 a 90 increase in net income and an 83 increase in diluted earnings per share gross profit margins within our homebuilding business increased to 185 in 2009 from 126 in 2008 as prior year gross profit margins were negatively impacted by a 165000 contract land deposit impairment charge 

over the last several years due to the significant decline in new orders and selling prices we worked with our developers to reduce lot prices to current market values andor to defer scheduled lot purchases to coincide with our slower than expected sales pace in communities where we were unsuccessful in negotiating necessary adjustments to the purchase agreements to meet current market prices we exited the community and forfeited our deposit under the applicable purchase agreement in addition we also forfeited our deposits in certain communities we did not exit in order to restructure the purchase agreement to current market prices during 2008 we incurred contract land deposit impairment charges of approximately 165000 from actual or expected terminations or from restructured purchase agreements where we forfeited or determined we would forfeit the deposit in 2009 as the result of market stabilization in several of our markets we recognized a net recovery of approximately 6500 of contract land deposits previously considered to be uncollectible as noted above as of december 31 2009 we had a reserve of approximately 89500 on outstanding contract land deposits related to approximately 10800 lots these lots are included in the total number of lots controlled mentioned above in addition to controlling lot costs we also have worked aggressively with our subcontractors and suppliers to gain efficiencies and reduce material and labor costs incurred in the construction process we also continue to evaluate and alter our product offerings where necessary to provide competitively priced homes 

we expect to continue to experience pressure on sales and selling prices over at least the next several quarters in all of our market segments due to significant uncertainties in the homebuilding market certain of the government’s stimulus programs which we believe helped to stabilize home prices such as the federal tax credit for first time and moveup buyers and the federal reserve’s purchases of mortgagebacked securities are expected to end in 2010 the result of which may lead to a decline in demand and higher mortgage interest rates despite these uncertainties we believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities that may arise due to the strength of our balance sheet and liquidity as of december 31 2009 our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balances totaled approximately 1468000 during 2009 we repurchased 29950 of our senior notes reducing the principal amount of senior notes to 133370 all of our outstanding senior notes are due in june of 2010 

homebuilding operations 

the following table summarizes the results of our consolidated homebuilding operations and certain operating activity for each of the last three years 

 

consolidated homebuilding revenues 

homebuilding revenues for 2009 decreased 26 from 2008 as a result of a 16 or 1699 unit decrease in the number of homes settled and a 12 decrease in the average settlement price the decrease in the number of units settled was primarily attributable to our beginning backlog units being approximately 39 or 1981 

units lower entering 2009 compared to the backlog unit balance entering 2008 offset partially by a higher backlog turnover rate period over period average settlement prices were impacted primarily by a 15 lower average price of homes in the beginning backlog entering 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 coupled with a 9 decline in the average sales price of new orders for the first six months of 2009 as compared to the same period in 2008 

homebuilding revenues for 2008 decreased 28 from 2007 primarily as a result of a 21 decrease in the number of homes settled and a 9 decrease in the average settlement price the decrease in the number of units settled was primarily attributable to our beginning backlog units being approximately 19 lower entering 2008 compared to the beginning backlog units entering 2007 and lower new orders year over year average settlement prices were impacted primarily by a 10 lower average price of homes in the beginning backlog entering 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 and also by lower average sales prices for new orders in 2008 compared to 2007 

consolidated homebuilding new orders 

new orders in 2009 increased by 7 compared to 2008 while the average sales price of new orders decreased 6 year over year as mentioned above in the overview section the increase in new orders in the current year was in part attributable to a 47 increase in new orders in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 a period in which we experienced a significant dropoff in new orders due to a sharp decline in overall economic conditions in addition new orders in 2009 were favorably impacted by higher absorption rates offsetting the 17 decrease in the average number of active communities year over year we believe new orders in the current year were also favorably impacted by the federal tax credit for firsttime homebuyers as well as by a decrease in the cancellation rate to 14 in 2009 from 23 in 2008 to meet affordability issues in many of our markets we have altered our product offerings to provide smaller lower priced products 

new orders and the average sales price of new orders decreased 29 and 12 respectively in 2008 compared to 2007 both the number of new orders and the average selling prices were negatively impacted by the continued deterioration in market conditions in 2008 from the prior year new orders were also negatively impacted by a 16 decrease in the average number of active communities year over year to 427 in 2008 from 505 in 2007 and a reduction in traffic per community year over year 

consolidated homebuilding gross profit 

gross profit margins in 2009 improved to 185 compared to 126 in 2008 primarily due to a favorable variance in contract land deposit impairment charges year over year in 2009 we recognized the recovery of approximately 6500 or 24 basis points of contract land deposits previously determined to be uncollectible in 2008 we recognized a contract land deposit impairment charge of approximately 165000 or 454 basis points gross profit margins in 2009 were also favorably impacted as a result of us exiting a significant number of poor performing communities in 2008 which were producing lower gross profit margins in addition gross profit margins in 2009 were favorably impacted by lower lumber and certain other commodity costs as well as by cost control measures implemented to reduce subcontractor and material costs in prior periods we expect to experience continued fluctuations in gross profit margins due to the aforementioned economic uncertainties still prevalent in the market 

gross profit margins in 2008 declined to 126 compared to 163 in 2007 despite lower contract land deposit impairment charges in 2008 of approximately 165000 or 454 basis points compared to approximately 261800 or 519 basis points in 2007 the decline in gross profit margins was primarily driven by continued pressure on selling prices as a result of challenging market conditions including a decline in demand due to low consumer confidence levels and deteriorating credit markets 

consolidated homebuilding selling general and administrative “sga” 

sga expenses in 2009 decreased approximately 75600 compared to 2008 but increased slightly as a percentage of revenue to 87 in 2009 from 85 in 2008 the decrease in sga expenses was primarily attributable to a 36300 decrease in selling and marketing costs in 2009 compared to 2008 due to a 17 decrease in the average number of active communities year over year to 355 in 2009 from 427 in 2008 in addition personnel costs were down approximately 26900 due primarily to 24 decrease in average staffing levels year over year 

sga expenses in 2008 decreased approximately 34800 or 10 from 2007 but increased as a percentage of revenue to 85 in 2008 from 68 in 2007 the decrease in sga expenses was attributable to a decrease in selling and marketing costs of approximately 31000 related to the previously mentioned 16 reduction in the average number of active communities in 2008 compared to 2007 in addition personnel costs decreased approximately 20000 as a result of lower staffing levels and lower management incentive costs year over year these declines were offset partially by an increase of approximately 24600 in stockbased compensation expense in 2008 compared to 2007 this increase was attributable to the reversal of approximately 28450 in sga classified stockbased compensation costs in the third quarter of 2007 related to approximately 400000 outstanding stock options which were subject to a performance metric which we determined in 2007 would not be achieved 

consolidated homebuilding backlog 

backlog units and dollars were 3531 and 1076437 respectively as of december 31 2009 compared to 3164 and 1002795 as of december 31 2008 net new order and settlement activity during 2009 resulted in the increase in backlog units year over year the 7 increase in backlog dollars was primarily attributable to the 12 increase in backlog units offset partially by a 4 decrease in the average price of homes in ending backlog 

backlog which represents homes sold but not yet settled with the customer may be impacted by customer cancellations for various reasons that are beyond our control such as failure to obtain mortgage financing inability to sell an existing home job loss or a variety of other reasons in any period a portion of the cancellations that we experience are related to new sales that occurred during the same period and a portion are related to sales that occurred in prior periods and therefore appeared in the opening backlog for the current period expressed as the total of all cancellations during the period as a percentage of gross sales during the period our cancellation rate was approximately 14 23 and 21 in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively during 2009 and 2008 approximately 7 and 10 of a reporting quarter’s opening backlog cancelled during the fiscal quarter respectively we can provide no assurance that our historical cancellation rates are indicative of the actual cancellation rate that may occur in 2010 see “risk factors” in item 1a of this report 

backlog units and dollars were 3164 and 1002795 respectively as of december 31 2008 compared to 5145 and 1910504 as of december 31 2007 the 39 decrease in backlog units was attributable to our beginning backlog units being approximately 19 lower entering 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 in addition backlog units were negatively impacted by the aforementioned 29 decline in new orders year over year backlog dollars were negatively impacted by the decrease in backlog units coupled with a 15 decrease in the average price of homes in ending backlog resulting primarily from an 8 decrease in the average selling price for new orders over the sixmonth period ended december 31 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 

consolidated homebuilding — other charges 

we reassessed our goodwill and intangible asset balances for impairment in the fourth quarter of 2008 as a result of the continuing declines in new orders and backlog as discussed above and the continuing deterioration of the homebuilding environment in each of our markets spurred further in 2008 by the credit crisis in the latter part of 2008 as a result of this assessment it was determined that the goodwill and intangible assets related to our rymarc homes and fox ridge homes operations were fully impaired and we wroteoff a total of 11686 related to such assets in 2008 we completed the annual assessment of the intangible asset balance in 2009 and 

determined that there was no impairment see note 1 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements included herein for further discussion of intangible assets 

reportable homebuilding segments 

homebuilding profit before tax includes all revenues and income generated from the sale of homes less the cost of homes sold sga expenses and a corporate capital allocation charge determined at the corporate headquarters the corporate capital allocation charge eliminates in consolidation is based on the segment’s average net assets employed and is charged using a consistent methodology in the years presented the corporate capital allocation charged to the operating segment allows the chief operating decision maker to determine whether the operating segment’s results are providing the desired rate of return after covering our cost of capital we record charges on contract land deposits when we determine that it is probable that recovery of the deposit is impaired for segment reporting purposes impairments on contract land deposits are generally charged to the operating segment upon the determination to terminate a finished lot purchase agreement with the developer or to restructure a lot purchase agreement resulting in the forfeiture of the deposit we evaluate our entire net contract land deposit portfolio for impairment each quarter for additional information regarding our contract land deposit impairment analysis see the critical accounting policies section within this management discussion and analysis for presentation purposes below the contract land deposit reserve at december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively has been allocated to the reportable segments to show contract land deposits on a net basis the net contract land deposit balances below also includes 4900 5400 and 9000 at december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively of letters of credit issued as deposits in lieu of cash the following tables summarize certain homebuilding operating activity by reportable segment for each of the last three years

the mid atlantic segment had an approximate 82200 or 79 increase in segment profit in 2009 compared to 2008 revenues for the mid atlantic segment which represents approximately 62 of total homebuilding revenues for the year decreased approximately 500500 or 23 in 2009 compared to 2008 revenues declined due to a 10 or 518 unit decrease in units settled and a 15 decrease in the average settlement price of homes in 2009 compared to 2008 the decrease in units settled is attributable to a 35 or 950 unit lower backlog balance at the beginning of 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 offset partially by a higher backlog turnover rate year over year the decrease in the average settlement price is primarily attributable to a 17 lower average price of homes in the beginning backlog year over year coupled with a 9 decline in the average sales price of new orders for the first six months of 2009 as compared to the same period in 2008 the segment’s gross profit margin percentage increased to 185 in 2009 from 136 in 2008 gross profit margins were favorably impacted by lower contract land deposit impairment charges in 2009 of 18425 or 111 basis points compared to 81834 or 379 basis points in 2008 gross profit margins in 2009 were also favorably impacted as a result of us exiting poor performing communities in 2008 which were producing lower gross profit margins in addition 2009 gross profit margins as well as segment profit were favorably impacted by lower lumber and certain other commodity costs as well as by cost control measures taken in prior quarters reducing material and personnel costs 

segment new orders in 2009 increased 12 from 2008 while the segment’s average sales price of new orders decreased 7 year over year new orders increased despite an 18 decrease in the average number of active communities in 2009 compared to 2008 new orders were favorably impacted in part by a 43 increase in the number of new orders in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 as a result of the significant impact of the fourth quarter 2008 credit crisis on the homebuilding market new orders were also favorably impacted in the current year by a decrease in the cancellation rate in 2009 to 14 from 24 during 2008 in addition we believe that the federal tax credit for firsttime homebuyers had a favorable impact on new orders in the current year as firsttime homebuyers made up a higher percentage of our total sales in the segment year over year 

net new order and settlement activity in 2009 resulted in a 5 increase in backlog units while backlog dollars remained relatively flat year over year the increase in backlog units is primarily attributable to the aforementioned increase in new orders in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 backlog dollars were impacted by the increase in backlog units offset partially by a 3 decrease in the average price of homes in ending backlog 

2008 versus 2007 

the mid atlantic segment had an approximate 187300 or 64 decrease in segment profit in 2008 compared to 2007 revenues for the mid atlantic segment which represent approximately 59 of total homebuilding revenues for the year decreased approximately 937300 or 30 for the year from the prior year period this decrease was attributable to a 21 decrease in the number of units settled and a 12 decrease in the average settlement price the decrease in units settled was attributable to a 26 lower backlog unit balance at the beginning of 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 and to a 25 decline in new orders year over year the decrease in the average settlement price was primarily attributable to an 11 lower average price of homes in the beginning backlog period over period and was also impacted by lower average selling prices of new orders in 2008 compared to 2007 the segment’s gross profit margin percentage fell to 136 in 2008 from 177 in 2007 gross profit margins were adversely affected by the downward pressure on selling prices which resulted in the aforementioned 12 decrease in the average settlement price gross profit margins were also negatively impacted in each respective period by contract land deposit impairment charges of 81834 or 379 basis points in 2008 compared to 153601 or 496 basis points in 2007 

new orders in the mid atlantic segment for 2008 decreased 25 from 2007 and the segment’s average new order sales price decreased 15 year over year new orders and the average selling price for new orders were down in each of our markets within the mid atlantic segment and were negatively impacted by challenging market conditions in addition new orders were negatively impacted by a 15 decrease in the average number of active communities to 205 in 2008 from 242 in 2007 within the segment backlog units and dollars decreased approximately 35 and 46 respectively year over year the decrease in backlog units was attributable to the beginning backlog units being approximately 26 lower entering 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 in addition backlog units were negatively impacted by the aforementioned decline in new orders in 2008 compared to 2007 backlog dollars were negatively impacted by the decrease in backlog units and a 17 decrease in the average price of homes in ending backlog

the north east segment had an approximate 6400 or 49 increase in segment profit in 2009 compared to 2008 despite a decrease in revenues of approximately 92500 or 27 year over year the decline in revenues was due to a 19 or 204 unit decrease in the number of units settled and a 10 decrease in the average settlement price year over year the decrease in the number of units settled and the average settlement price is primarily attributable to a 40 or 202 unit lower beginning backlog balance entering 2009 compared to 2008 and 15 lower average price of homes in beginning backlog year over year gross profit margins increased to 166 in 2009 from 134 in 2008 the increase in gross margins was attributable primarily to lower contract land deposit impairment charges in 2009 of 2489 or 98 basis points compared to 2008 of 11190 or 322 basis points in addition 2009 gross profit margins as well as segment profit were favorably impacted by lower lumber and certain other commodity costs as well as by cost control measures taken in prior quarters reducing material and personnel costs 

segment new orders in 2009 increased 2 from 2008 while the segment’s average sales price for new orders decreased 2 year over year new orders were favorably impacted in part by a 26 increase in the number of new orders in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 as a result of the significant impact of the fourth quarter 2008 credit crisis on the homebuilding market we believe new orders were also favorably impacted in the current year by the federal tax credit for firsttime homebuyers and by a decrease in the cancellation rate to 15 in 2009 from 20 in 2008 

net new order and settlement activity in 2009 resulted in an increase in backlog units and dollars of approximately 7 and 13 respectively the increase in backlog units is primarily attributable to the aforementioned increase in new orders in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 backlog dollars were impacted by the increase in backlog units coupled with a 5 increase in the average selling price for new orders for the sixmonth period ended december 31 2009 compared to the same period in 2008

segment new orders and the average new order sales price for 2008 decreased 27 and 12 respectively from 2007 due to challenging market conditions in addition new orders were negatively impacted by a decrease in the average number of active communities within the north east segment backlog units and dollars decreased approximately 40 and 49 respectively year over year the decrease in backlog units was attributable to the decline in new orders in 2008 compared to 2007 in addition to a 7 lower beginning backlog unit balance entering 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 the decrease in backlog dollars was due to the decrease in backlog units and to the 12 decrease in the average selling price for new orders for the sixmonth period ended december 31 2008 compared to the same period in 2007

the mid east segment had an approximate 1600 or 4 decrease in segment profit and an approximate 154200 or 23 decrease in revenues in 2009 compared to 2008 revenues decreased due to a 16 or 439 unit decrease in the number of units settled and a 9 decrease in the average settlement price period over period the decreases in the number of units settled and the average settlement price were primarily attributable to a 34 or 382 unit lower beginning backlog balance and 9 lower average price of homes in beginning backlog year over year respectively in addition average settlement prices were negatively impacted by a 10 decline in the average sales price of new orders for the first six months of 2009 as compared to the same period in 2008 gross profit margins increased year over year as cost reduction measures initiated in prior periods offset the decrease in the average settlement price in 2009 compared to 2008 gross profit margins in 2009 were also favorably impacted as a result of us exiting poor performing communities in 2008 which were producing lower gross profit margins 

segment new orders in 2009 increased 7 from 2008 while the segment’s average sales price for new orders decreased 5 year over year new orders were favorably impacted in part by a 51 increase in the number of new orders in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 as a result of the significant impact of the fourth quarter 2008 credit crisis on the homebuilding market we believe new orders in the current year were also favorably impacted by the federal tax credit for firsttime homebuyers and a decrease in the cancellation rate to 14 in 2009 from 18 in 2008 despite a reduction in the average number of active communities year over year new order average sale prices continue to be negatively impacted by market conditions which have required us to alter our product offerings and reduce prices in each market within this segment 

net new order and settlement activity in 2009 resulted in an increase in backlog units and dollars of approximately 31 and 32 respectively the increase in backlog units is primarily attributable to the aforementioned increase in new orders in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 backlog dollars were impacted by the increase in backlog units

the mid east segment had an approximate 38900 or 50 decrease in segment profit in 2008 compared to 2007 revenues decreased approximately 200500 or 23 in 2008 from 2007 due to a 17 decrease in the number of units settled and an 8 decrease in the average settlement price period over period the decrease in the number of units settled and the average settlement price was primarily attributable to a 13 lower beginning backlog balance and 9 lower average price of homes in beginning backlog period over period in addition the number of units settled was negatively impacted by a decline in new orders year over year gross profit margins decreased to 159 in 2008 from 181 in 2007 contract land deposit impairment charges in the segment were approximately 10393 or 158 basis points in 2008 compared to 10838 or 126 basis points in 2007 the decline in gross profit margins was primarily driven by continued pressure on selling prices due to challenging market conditions which resulted in an 8 decrease in the average settlement price year over year 

segment new orders and the average new order sales price in 2008 decreased 25 and 8 respectively from 2007 new orders were negatively impacted by market conditions which remained challenging in addition new orders were negatively impacted by a 16 decrease in the average number of active communities within the mid east segment year over year and by an increase in the cancellation rate in the segment to 18 in 2008 from 15 in 2007 backlog units and dollars decreased approximately 34 and 40 respectively year over year the decrease in backlog units was attributable to the beginning backlog units being approximately 13 lower entering 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 in addition backlog units were negatively impacted by the decline in new orders in 2008 compared to 2007 the decrease in backlog dollars was attributable to the decrease in backlog units and to a 9 decrease in the average selling price for new orders for the sixmonth period ended december 31 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 

south east 

2009 versus 2008 

the south east segment had an approximate 500 or 7 decrease in segment profit and an approximate 208000 or 44 decrease in revenues in 2009 compared to 2008 revenues decreased primarily due to a 33 or 538 unit decrease in the number of units settled and a 17 decrease in the average settlement price year over year the decrease in units settled was attributable to a 56 or 447 unit lower beginning backlog balance entering 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 coupled with a 25 or 203 unit decrease in new orders during the first six months of 2009 as compared to the first six months of 2008 the decrease in the average settlement price was primarily attributable to a 16 lower average price of units in backlog entering 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 coupled with a 16 decline in the average sales price of new orders for the first six months of 2009 as compared to the same period in 2008 gross profit margins increased to 139 in 2009 from 128 in 2008 gross profit margins were favorably impacted by lower contract land deposit impairment charges in 2009 of 5236 or 200 basis points compared to 20081 or 427 basis points in 2008 this favorable impact on gross profit margins year over year was partially offset by a 12 decline in average new order sales prices in 2009 from 2008 as the south east segment market conditions remain more challenging than those seen in our other market segments 

segment new orders and the average new order sales price decreased 5 and 12 respectively in 2009 compared to 2008 new orders have been negatively impacted by a 23 decrease in the average number of active communities year over year in addition as mentioned above the challenging market conditions in the south east segment have continued to negatively impact both new orders and new order sales prices we believe new orders were favorably impacted in the current year by the federal tax credit for firsttime homebuyers and by a decrease in cancellation rates to 15 in 2009 from 29 in 2008 

net new order and settlement activity in 2009 resulted in an 8 or 29 unit increase in backlog while backlog dollars remained relatively flat year over year the increase in backlog units is primarily attributable to an 84 or 122 unit increase in the number of new orders in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 as a result of the significant impact of the fourth quarter 2008 credit crisis on the homebuilding market backlog dollars were impacted by the increase in backlog units offset partially by a 6 decrease in the average price of homes in ending backlog due to a decrease in the average selling price for new orders for the sixmonth period ended december 31 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 

2008 versus 2007 

the south east segment had an approximate 79800 or 91 decrease in segment profit in 2008 compared to 2007 revenues decreased approximately 185200 or 28 in 2008 from 2007 due to a 29 decrease in the number of units settled period over period the decrease in units settled was attributable to a 12 lower beginning backlog unit balance entering 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 and to a decline in new orders year over year gross profit margins decreased to 128 in 2008 from 220 in 2007 gross profit margins were negatively impacted in 2008 by increased contract land deposit impairment charges of approximately 20081 or 427 basis points in 2008 compared to approximately 4766 or 73 basis points in 

2007 gross profit margins were also negatively impacted by the use of increased sales incentives and by higher average lot and operating costs per settled unit 

segment new orders and the average new order sales price decreased 45 and 10 respectively during 2008 compared to 2007 market conditions within the south east segment continued to deteriorate throughout 2008 these worsening market conditions resulted in lower sales absorption rates within our active communities and higher cancellation rates year over year new orders were negatively impacted by a 10 decrease in the average number of active communities to 65 in 2008 from 73 in 2007 within the segment cancellation rates in the overall segment increased to 29 in 2008 from 20 in 2007 the 45 decrease in new orders for 2008 coupled with a 12 lower beginning backlog balance entering 2008 compared to 2007 resulted in a 56 decrease in backlog units as of december 31 2008 compared to december 31 2007 the decrease in backlog units coupled with a decline of 16 in the average backlog price resulted in a 63 decline in backlog dollars year over year 

homebuilding segment reconciliations to consolidated homebuilding operations 

in addition to the corporate capital allocation and contract land deposit impairments discussed above the other reconciling items between homebuilding segment profit and homebuilding consolidated profit before tax include unallocated corporate overhead which includes all management incentive compensation stock option compensation expense goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges consolidation adjustments and external corporate interest expense our overhead functions such as accounting treasury human resources etc are centrally performed and the costs are not allocated to our operating segments consolidation adjustments consist of such items to convert the reportable segments’ results which are predominantly maintained on a cash basis to a full accrual basis for external financial statement presentation purposes and are not allocated to our operating segments likewise stock option compensation expense and goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges are not charged to the operating segments external corporate interest expense is primarily comprised of interest charges on our outstanding senior notes and working capital line borrowings and is not charged to the operating segments because the charges are included in the corporate capital allocation discussed above

mortgage banking segment 

we conduct our mortgage banking activity through nvr mortgage finance inc “nvrm” a wholly owned subsidiary nvrm focuses almost exclusively on serving the homebuilding segment’s customer base following is a table of financial and statistical data for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 

 

2009 versus 2008 

loan closing volume for the year ended december 31 2009 decreased 12 from 2008 the 2009 decrease was primarily attributable to a 7 decrease in the number of units closed and a 6 decrease in the average loan amount year over year these decreases are attributable to the aforementioned decrease in the homebuilding segment’s number of units settled and the decrease in the average settlement prices in 2009 as compared to 2008 the aforementioned decrease in builder settlements in 2009 compared to 2008 was partially offset by a 6 percentage point increase in the number of loans closed by nvrm for our homebuyers who obtain a mortgage to purchase the home “capture rate” which increased to 91 for the period ended december 31 2009 compared to 85 for the same period in 2008 

segment profit for the year ended december 31 2009 increased approximately 8900 from 2008 the increase was partially attributable to an approximate 6000 increase in mortgage banking fees which was primarily the result of a decrease in incentives the increase was partially offset by a decrease in fees attributable to the aforementioned decrease in closed loan volume the increase in mortgage banking fees for the year ended december 31 2009 was also partially attributable to an approximate 440 increase in unrealized income from the fair value measurement of our locked loan commitments forward mortgagebacked securities sales and closed loans held for sale which is included in mortgage banking fees the fair value calculations are classified as level 2 observable inputs as defined by gaap refer to note 11 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information the aforementioned fair value measurements will be impacted in the future by changes in volume and product mix of our closed loans and locked loan commitments 

the increase in segment profit for the year ended december 31 2009 was also partially attributable to an approximate 4400 decrease in general and administrative expenses compared to the same period for 2008 the decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of a decrease in salary and other personnel costs primarily as the result of an approximate 24 decrease in staffing compared to the same period for 2008 

2008 versus 2007 

loan closing volume for the year ended december 31 2008 decreased 27 from 2007 the 2008 decrease was primarily attributable to a 19 decrease in the number of units closed and a 10 decrease in the average loan amount year over year these decreases are attributable to the aforementioned decrease in the homebuilding segment’s number of units settled and average settlement prices in 2008 as compared to 2007 

segment profit for the year ended december 31 2008 decreased approximately 25300 from 2007 the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in mortgage banking fees attributable to the aforementioned decrease in closed loan volume and a reduction in fees charged to customers to assist our selling efforts in the homebuilding segment the decrease to mortgage banking fees was partially offset by 31 basis point increase in fees received for servicing released premiums as a result of the product mix shift towards fixed rate mortgages partly driven by an increase in the use of fha fixed rate loan products which generally carry a higher servicing released premium than other nonfha loan products 

the decrease to mortgage banking fees for the year ended december 31 2008 was also partially offset by an approximate 900 increase in unrealized income from the fair value measurement of our locked loan commitments forward mortgagebacked securities sales and closed loans held for sale which is included in mortgage banking fees the fair value measurement was the result of changes to the gaap fair value measurement which the company adopted on a prospective basis as of january 1 2008 as a result of the adoption of the gaap fair value measurement changes the fair value measurement for locked loan commitments and closed loans held for sale includes the assumed gainloss on the expected resultant loan sale and the value of the servicing rights associated with the loan this is in addition to the prior fair value measurement which only considered the effects of interest rate movements between the date of the rate lock and either the loan closing date or the balance sheet date the fair value calculations are classified as level 2 observable inputs as defined in gaap refer to note 11 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information the fair value measurement will be impacted in the future by the change in volume and product mix of our closed and locked loan commitments 

mortgage banking — other 

nvrm is dependent on our homebuilding segment’s customers for business as sales and selling prices of the homebuilding segment decline nvrm’s operations are likewise adversely affected in addition nvrm’s operating results may be adversely affected in future periods due to the continued tightening and volatility of the credit markets 

seasonality 

overall we do not experience material seasonal fluctuations in sales settlements or loan closings 

effective tax rate 

our consolidated effective tax rate in 2009 2008 and 2007 was 356 3975 and 381 respectively the lower effective tax rate in 2009 was due to the expiration of certain tax reserves previously established the amendment of certain prior year federal and state income tax returns that we believe will result in tax refunds and recent irs guidance allowing us to take a larger benefit under internal revenue code section 199 domestic manufacturing deduction in addition due to mr schar relinquishing his executive officer role with us in 2009 a tax benefit was generated related to compensation expense recorded for certain outstanding option grants held by mr schar that were previously considered to be a 

permanent nondeductible tax difference the higher effective tax rate in 2008 was primarily due to the reduction in tax exempt interest income and lower pretax income in 2008 compared to 2007 we expect our effective tax rate in 2010 to be inline with our effective tax rates in 2008 and 2007 

recent accounting pronouncements pending adoption 

in june 2009 the fasb issued sfas no 166 accounting for transfers of financial assets  as codified in asc 860 transfers and servicing  which changes the conditions for reporting a transfer of a portion of a financial asset as a sale and requires additional yearend and interim disclosures these amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2009 the implementation of which are not expected to have a material impact on the company’s financial statements 

in june 2009 the fasb issued sfas no 167 amendments to fasb interpretation no 46r as codified in asc 810 consolidation  through accounting standards update 200917 this statement amends fasb interpretation 46r related to the consolidation of variable interest entities “vies” and revises the approach to determining the primary beneficiary of a vie to be more qualitative in nature and requires companies to more frequently reassess whether they must consolidate a vie the amendment to asc 810 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2009 we are evaluating the impact of the amendment and currently believe that upon adoption the majority of development entities associated with our fixed price purchase agreements would no longer be required to be consolidated

net cash used for investing activities during 2009 was 221617 for the year ended december 31 2009 which primarily resulted from the net purchase of marketable securities during 2009 the marketable securities which are debt securities issued by the us treasury and other us government corporations and agencies are classified as heldtomaturity securities and mature within one year 

net cash provided by financing activities during 2009 was 82482 for the year ended december 31 2009 financing cash flow was favorably impacted by approximately 78500 of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the realization of approximately 66400 in excess income tax benefits from the exercise of stock options cash was used by financing activities to reduce net borrowings under the mortgage warehouse facility by approximately 32200 and we repurchased 29950 of our 5 senior notes due 2010 at par during 2009 

in 2008 cash and cash equivalents increased by approximately 483000 operating activities provided cash of 462361 cash was provided primarily by homebuilding operations and a reduction in our homebuilding inventories of approximately 288000 due to a reduction in the number of homes under construction at the end of 2008 as compared to the same period in 2007 operating cash flow was reduced by a decrease in our customer deposits of approximately 66000 the presentation of operating cash flows was also reduced by approximately 50000 which is the amount of the excess tax benefit realized from the exercise of stock options during the period and credited directly to additional paid in capital cash used for investing activities of 5498 in 2008 was used primarily for property and equipment purchases financing activities in 2008 provided 26571 due primarily to proceeds from the exercise of stock options of approximately 52000 and the realization of approximately 50000 in excess income tax benefits from the exercise of stock options cash was used in financing activities to reduce net borrowings under the mortgage warehouse facility by approximately 39000 and to repurchase 36680 of our 5 senior notes due 2010 at a cost of approximately 36400 

in 2007 cash and cash equivalents increased by approximately 108090 operating activities provided cash of 558766 cash was provided primarily by homebuilding operations and an approximate 71000 decrease in mortgage loans held for sale the presentation of operating cash flows was reduced by approximately 69000 related to the amount of the excess tax benefit realized from the exercise of stock options during the year cash provided by operating activities were partially offset by cash used for financing activities of 441361 due to our repurchase of approximately 507500 of our common stock 

at december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 the homebuilding segment had restricted cash of approximately 4600 4500 and 6200 respectively which relates to customer deposits on certain home sales 

we believe that our current cash holdings cash generated from operations and borrowings available under our credit facilities will be sufficient to satisfy near and long term cash requirements for working capital and debt service in both our homebuilding and mortgage banking operations 

off balance sheet arrangements 

lot acquisition strategy 

we do not engage in land development instead we typically acquire finished building lots at market prices from various land developers under fixed price purchase agreements that require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the agreement the deposits required under the purchase agreements are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percentage typically ranging up to 10 of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots 

we believe that our lot acquisition strategy reduces the financial requirements and risks associated with direct land ownership and land development we may at our option choose for any reason and at any time not to perform under these purchase agreements by delivering notice of our intent not to acquire the finished lots under contract our sole legal obligation and economic loss for failure to perform under these purchase agreements is limited to the amount of the deposit pursuant to the liquidating damage provision contained within the purchase agreements we do not have any financial guarantees or completion obligations and we typically do not guarantee lot purchases on a specific performance basis under these purchase agreements 

at december 31 2009 we controlled approximately 46300 lots with an aggregate purchase price of approximately 3900000 by making or committing to make deposits of approximately 167100 in the form of cash and letters of credit our entire risk of loss pertaining to the aggregate purchase price contractual commitment resulting from our nonperformance under the contracts is limited to the 167100 deposit of the 167100 deposit total approximately 140700 is in cash and approximately 4900 is in letters of credit which have been issued as of december 31 2009 subsequent to december 31 2009 we will pay approximately 21500 in additional deposits assuming that contractual development milestones are met by the developers see contractual obligations section below as of december 31 2009 we had recorded an impairment valuation allowance of approximately 89500 related to the cash deposits currently outstanding please refer to note 1 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of the contract land deposits and note 3 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of our lot acquisition strategy in relation to our accounting related to the consolidation of variable interest entities  

bonds and letters of credit 

we enter into bond or letter of credit arrangements with local municipalities government agencies or land developers to collateralize our obligations under various contracts we had approximately 36900 of contingent obligations under such agreements as of december 31 2009 inclusive of the 4900 of lot acquisition deposits in the form of letters of credit discussed above we believe we will fulfill our obligations under the related contracts and do not anticipate any material losses under these bonds or letters of credit 

mortgage commitments and forward sales 

in the normal course of business our mortgage banking segment enters into contractual commitments to extend credit to buyers of singlefamily homes with fixed expiration dates the commitments become effective when the borrowers “lockin” a specified interest rate within time frames established by nvr all mortgagors are evaluated for credit worthiness prior to the extension of the commitment market risk arises if interest rates move adversely between the time of the “lockin” of rates by the borrower and the sale date of the loan to a brokerdealer to mitigate the effect of the interest rate risk inherent in providing rate lock commitments to borrowers we enter into optional or mandatory delivery forward sale contracts to sell whole loans and mortgagebacked securities to brokerdealers the forward sale contracts lock in an interest rate and price for the sale of loans similar to the specific rate lock commitments nvr does not engage in speculative or trading derivative activities both the rate lock commitments to borrowers and the forward sale contracts to brokerdealers are undesignated derivatives and accordingly are marked to fair value through earnings at december 31 2009 there were contractual commitments to extend credit to borrowers aggregating approximately 130100 and open forward delivery sale contracts aggregating approximately 141800 please refer to note 11 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of our fair value accounting 

contractual obligations 

our fixed noncancelable obligations as of december 31 2009 were as follows 

 

 

 critical accounting policies 

  general 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial 

statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods we continually evaluate the estimates we use to prepare the consolidated financial statements and update those estimates as necessary in general our estimates are based on historical experience on information from third party professionals and other various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances actual results could differ materially from those estimates made by management 

  variable interest entities 

gaap requires the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity to consolidate that entity in its financial statements the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is the party that absorbs a majority of the variable interest entity’s expected losses receives a majority of the entity’s expected residual returns or both as a result of ownership contractual or other financial interests in the entity expected losses are the expected negative variability in the fair value of an entity’s net assets exclusive of its variable interests and expected residual returns are the expected positive variability in the fair value of an entity’s net assets exclusive of its variable interests 

forward contracts such as the fixed price purchase agreements utilized by us to acquire finished lot inventory are deemed to be variable interests therefore the development entities with which we enter fixed price purchase agreements are examined for possible consolidation by us including certain joint venture limited liability corporations “llcs” utilized by us to acquire finished lots on a limited basis we have developed a methodology to determine whether we or conversely the owners of the applicable development entity are the primary beneficiary of a development entity the methodology used to evaluate our primary beneficiary status requires substantial management judgment and estimates these judgments and estimates involve assigning probabilities to various estimated cash flow possibilities relative to the development entity’s expected profits and losses and the cash flows associated with changes in the fair value of finished lots under contract although we believe that our accounting policy is designed to properly assess our primary beneficiary status relative to our involvement with the development entities from which we acquire finished lots changes to the probabilities and the cash flow possibilities used in our evaluation could produce widely different conclusions regarding whether we are or are not a development entity’s primary beneficiary possibly resulting in additional or fewer development entities being consolidated on our financial statements see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

  homebuilding inventory 

the carrying value of inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market value cost of lots and completed and uncompleted housing units represent the accumulated actual cost of the units field construction supervisors’ salaries and related direct overhead expenses are included in inventory costs interest costs are not capitalized into inventory upon settlement the cost of the unit is expensed on a specific identification basis cost of manufacturing materials is determined on a firstin firstout basis 

sold inventory is evaluated for impairment based on the contractual selling price compared to the total estimated cost to construct unsold inventory is evaluated for impairment by analyzing recent comparable sales prices within the applicable community compared to the costs incurred to date plus the expected costs to complete any calculated impairments are recorded immediately 

  contract land deposits 

we purchase finished lots under fixed price purchase agreements that require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the contract the deposits are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percentage of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots 

we maintain an allowance for losses on contract land deposits that reflects our judgment of the present loss exposure in the existing contract land deposit portfolio at the end of the reporting period to analyze contract land deposit impairments we utilize a loss contingency analysis that is conducted each quarter in 

addition to considering market and economic conditions we assess contract land deposit impairments on a communitybycommunity basis pursuant to the purchase contract terms analyzing as applicable current sales absorption levels recent sales’ gross profit the dollar differential between the contractual purchase price and the current market price for lots a developer’s financial stability a developer’s financial ability or willingness to reduce lot prices to current market prices and the contract’s default status by either us or the developer along with an analysis of the expected outcome of any such default 

our analysis is focused on whether we can sell houses profitably in a particular community in the current market with which we are faced because we don’t own the finished lots on which we had placed a contract land deposit if the above analysis leads to a determination that we can’t sell homes profitably at the current contractual lot price we then determine whether we will elect to default under the contract forfeit our deposit and terminate the contract or whether we will attempt to restructure the lot purchase contract which may require us to forfeit the deposit to obtain contract concessions from a developer we also assess whether an impairment is present due to collectibility issues resulting from a developer’s nonperformance because of financial or other conditions 

although we consider the allowance for losses on contract land deposits reflected on the december 31 2009 balance sheet to be adequate see note 1 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements there can be no assurance that this allowance will prove to be adequate over time to cover losses due to unanticipated adverse changes in the economy or other events adversely affecting specific markets or the homebuilding industry 

  intangible assets 

reorganization value in excess of identifiable assets “excess reorganization value” is an indefinite life intangible asset that was created upon our emergence from bankruptcy on september 30 1993 based on the allocation of our reorganization value the portion of our reorganization value which was not attributed to specific tangible or intangible assets has been reported as excess reorganization value which is treated similarly to goodwill excess reorganization value is not subject to amortization rather excess reorganization value is subject to an impairment assessment on an annual basis or more frequently if changes in events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred because excess reorganization value was based on the reorganization value of our entire enterprise upon bankruptcy emergence the impairment assessment is conducted on an enterprise basis based on the comparison of our total equity compared to the market value of our outstanding publiclytraded common stock we do not believe that excess reorganization value is impaired at this time however changes in strategy or continued adverse changes in market conditions could impact this judgment and require an impairment loss to be recognized if our book value including excess reorganization value exceeds the fair value 

  warranty  product liability accruals 

warranty and product liability accruals are established to provide for estimated future costs as a result of construction and product defects product recalls and litigation incidental to our business liability estimates are determined based on our judgment considering such factors as historical experience the likely current cost of corrective action manufacturers’ and subcontractors’ participation in sharing the cost of corrective action consultations with third party experts such as engineers and evaluations by our general counsel and outside counsel retained to handle specific product liability cases although we consider the warranty and product liability accrual reflected on the december 31 2009 balance sheet see note 10 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements to be adequate there can be no assurance that this accrual will prove to be adequate over time to cover losses due to increased costs for material and labor the inability or refusal of manufacturers or subcontractors to financially participate in corrective action unanticipated adverse legal settlements or other unanticipated changes to the assumptions used to estimate the warranty and product liability accrual 

  stock option expense 

compensation costs related to our stock based compensation plans are recognized within our income statement the costs recognized are based on the grant date fair value compensation cost for option grants is recognized on a straightline basis over the requisite service period for the entire award from the date of grant through the period of the last separately vesting portion of the grant 

we calculate the fair value of our nonpublicly traded employee stock options using the blackscholes optionpricing model while the blackscholes model is a widely accepted method to calculate the fair value of options its results are dependent on input variables two of which expected term and expected volatility are significantly dependent on management’s judgment we have concluded that our historical exercise experience is the best estimate of future exercise patterns to determine an option’s expected term to estimate expected volatility we analyze the historical volatility of our common stock changes in management’s judgment of the expected term and the expected volatility could have a material effect on the grantdate fair value calculated and expensed within the income statement in addition we are required to estimate future option forfeitures when considering the amount of stockbased compensation costs to record we have concluded that our historical forfeiture rate is the best measure to estimate future forfeitures of granted stock options however there can be no assurance that our future forfeiture rate will not be materially higher or lower than our historical forfeiture rate which would affect the aggregate cumulative compensation expense recognized

see risk factors included in item 1a herein see also the discussion above under overview of current business environment 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates our market risk arises from interest rate risk inherent in our financial instruments interest rate risk results from the possibility that changes in interest rates will cause unfavorable changes in net income or in the value of interest ratesensitive assets liabilities and commitments lower interest rates tend to increase demand for mortgage loans for home purchasers while higher interest rates make it more difficult for potential borrowers to purchase residential properties and to qualify for mortgage loans we have no market rate sensitive instruments held for speculative or trading purposes 

our mortgage banking segment is exposed to interest rate risk as it relates to its lending activities the mortgage banking segment originates mortgage loans which are sold through either optional or mandatory forward delivery contracts into the secondary markets all of the mortgage banking segment’s loan portfolio is held for sale and subject to forward sale commitments nvrm also sells all of its mortgage servicing rights on a servicing released basis 

our homebuilding segment generates operating liquidity and acquires capital assets through fixedrate and variablerate debt the homebuilding segment’s primary debt is a variablerate working capital revolving credit facility that currently provides for unsecured borrowings up to 300000 subject to certain borrowing base limitations the facility expires in december 2010 and outstanding amounts bear interest at either i the prime rate or ii libor plus applicable margin as defined within the facility there were no borrowings under the facility during 2009 

nvrm generates operating liquidity primarily through the mortgage repurchase agreement which provides for loan repurchases up to 100000 the repurchase agreement is used to fund nvrm’s mortgage origination activities advances under the repurchase agreement carry a pricing rate based on the libor rate plus the libor margin or at nvrm’s option the balance funded rate as these terms are defined in the repurchase agreement the weightedaverage pricing rate for amounts outstanding under the repurchase agreement was 26 during 2009 the average pricing rate for amounts outstanding at december 31 2009 was 41 

the following table represents the contractual balances of our onbalance sheet financial instruments at the expected maturity dates as well as the fair values of those onbalance sheet financial instruments at december 31 2009 the expected maturity categories take into consideration the actual and anticipated amortization of principal and do not take into consideration the reinvestment of cash or the refinancing of existing indebtedness because we sell all of the mortgage loans we originate into the secondary markets we have made the assumption that the portfolio of mortgage loans held for sale will mature in the first year consequently outstanding warehouse borrowings are also assumed to mature in the first year

 item 1 business 

general 

nvr inc “nvr” was formed in 1980 as nvhomes inc our primary business is the construction and sale of singlefamily detached homes townhomes and condominium buildings to fully serve customers of our homebuilding operations we also operate a mortgage banking business we conduct our homebuilding activities directly except for rymarc homes which is operated as a wholly owned subsidiary our mortgage banking operations are operated primarily through a wholly owned subsidiary nvr mortgage finance inc “nvrm” unless the context otherwise requires references to “nvr” “we” “us” or “our” include nvr and its consolidated subsidiaries 

we are one of the largest homebuilders in the united states while we operate in multiple locations in twelve states primarily in the eastern part of the united states approximately 34 of our home settlements in 2008 occurred in the washington dc and baltimore md metropolitan areas which accounted for 45 of our 2008 homebuilding revenues our homebuilding operations include the construction and sale of singlefamily detached homes townhomes and condominium buildings under four trade names ryan homes nvhomes fox ridge homes and rymarc homes the ryan homes fox ridge homes and rymarc homes products are marketed primarily to firsttime homeowners and firsttime moveup buyers the ryan homes product is currently sold in twenty metropolitan areas located in maryland virginia west virginia pennsylvania new york north carolina south carolina ohio new jersey delaware and kentucky the fox ridge homes product is sold solely in the nashville tn metropolitan area and the rymarc homes product is sold solely in the columbia sc metropolitan area the nvhomes product is marketed primarily to moveup and upscale buyers and is sold in the washington dc baltimore md philadelphia pa and the maryland eastern shore metropolitan areas in 2008 our average price of a settled unit was approximately 338000 

we do not engage in land development instead we acquire finished building lots at market prices from various development entities under fixed price purchase agreements “purchase agreements” that require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the purchase agreement the deposits required under the purchase agreements are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percentage typically ranging up to 10 of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots 

our lot acquisition strategy avoids the financial requirements and risks associated with direct land ownership and land development we may at our option choose for any reason and at any time not to perform under these purchase agreements by delivering notice of our intent not to acquire the finished lots under contract our sole legal obligation and economic loss for failure to perform under these purchase agreements is limited to the amount of the deposit pursuant to the liquidating damage provision contained within the purchase agreements we do not have any financial guarantees or completion obligations and we do not guarantee lot purchases on a specific performance basis under these purchase agreements we generally seek to maintain control over a supply of lots believed to be suitable to meet our fiveyear business plan 

on a very limited basis we also obtain finished lots using joint venture limited liability corporations “llcs” all llcs are structured such that we are a noncontrolling member and are at risk only for the amount we have invested we are not a borrower guarantor or obligor on any of the llcs debt we enter into a standard fixed price purchase agreement to purchase lots from these llcs at december 31 2008 we had an aggregate investment totaling approximately 8 million in nine separate llcs and we had recorded an impairment reserve equal to our total investment in these llcs 

  in addition to building and selling homes we provide a number of mortgagerelated services through our mortgage banking operations through operations in each of our homebuilding markets nvrm originates mortgage loans almost exclusively for our homebuyers nvrm generates revenues primarily from origination fees gains on sales of loans and title fees nvrm sells all of the mortgage loans it closes into the secondary markets on a servicing released basis 

segment information for our homebuilding and mortgage banking businesses is included in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

current business environment 

market conditions within the homebuilding industry continued to deteriorate throughout 2008 the slowdown which began in the second half of 2005 has been driven by the economic recession which has led to continued declining consumer confidence affordability issues and instability within the credit markets as demand for new homes has slowed the industry has been faced with higher levels of new and existing home inventories additionally existing home inventories have been adversely affected by rising foreclosure rates in 2008 each of these market factors has resulted in an extremely competitive sales environment and has forced us and our competitors to reduce prices and offer sales incentives in turn our home sales and profit margins have been negatively impacted when compared to prior years we expect the current challenging market conditions to continue in 2009 for additional information and analysis of recent trends in our operations and financial condition see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 of this form 10k 

homebuilding 

  products 

we offer singlefamily detached homes townhomes and condominium buildings with many different basic home designs these home designs have a variety of elevations and numerous other options our homes combine traditional or colonial exterior designs with contemporary interior designs and amenities generally include two to four bedrooms and range from approximately 1000 to 7300 square feet during 2008 the prices at which we settled homes ranged from approximately 43000 to 2000000 and averaged approximately 338000 during 2007 our average price was approximately 373000 

  markets 

our four reportable homebuilding segments operate in the following geographic regions 

 

further discussion of settlements new orders and backlog activity by homebuilding reportable segment for each of the last three years can be found in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 of this form 10k 

  backlog 

backlog totaled 3164 units and approximately 10 billion at december 31 2008 compared to backlog of 5145 units and approximately 19 billion at december 31 2007 our cancellation rate was approximately 23 during 2008 during 2007 and 2006 our cancellation rates were approximately 21 and 19 respectively we can provide no assurance that our historical cancellation rate is indicative of the actual cancellation rate that may occur in 2009 and our cancellation rate could continue to increase see “risk factors” in item 1a 

    construction 

we utilize independent subcontractors under fixed price contracts to perform construction work on our homes the subcontractors’ work is performed under the supervision of our employees who monitor quality control we use several independent subcontractors in our various markets and we are not dependent on any single subcontractor or on a small number of subcontractors 

  land development 

we do not engage in land development instead we purchase finished lots from various land developers under fixed price purchase agreements that require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the agreement the deposits required under the purchase agreements are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percentage typically ranging up to 10 of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots we are not dependent on any single developer or on a small number of developers 

  sales and marketing 

our preferred marketing method is for customers to visit a furnished model home featuring many builtin options and a landscaped lot the garages of these model homes are usually converted into temporary sales centers where alternative facades and floor plans are displayed and designs for other models are available for review sales representatives are compensated predominantly on a commission basis 

  regulation 

we and our subcontractors must comply with various federal state and local zoning building environmental advertising and consumer credit statutes rules and regulations as well as other regulations and requirements in connection with our construction and sales activities all of these regulations have increased the cost to produce and market our products and in some instances have delayed our developers’ abilities to deliver us finished lots counties and cities in which we build homes have at times declared moratoriums on the issuance of building permits and imposed other restrictions in the areas in which sewage treatment facilities and other public facilities do not reach minimum standards to date restrictive zoning laws and the imposition of moratoriums have not had a material adverse effect on our construction activities however in certain markets in which we operate we believe that our growth has been hampered by the longer time periods necessary for our developers to obtain the necessary governmental approvals 

  competition and market factors 

the housing industry is highly competitive we compete with numerous homebuilders of varying size ranging from local to national in scope some of which have greater financial resources than we do we also face competition from the home resale market our homebuilding operations compete primarily on the basis of price location design quality service and reputation historically we have been one of the market leaders in each of the markets where we build homes 

the housing industry is cyclical and is affected by consumer confidence levels prevailing economic conditions and interest rates other factors that affect the housing industry and the demand for new homes include the availability and the cost of land labor and materials changes in consumer preferences demographic trends and the availability of mortgage finance programs see “risk factors” in item 1a 

we are dependent upon building material suppliers for a continuous flow of raw materials whenever possible we utilize standard products available from multiple sources in the past such raw materials have been generally available to us in adequate supply 

  mortgage banking 

we provide a number of mortgage related services to our homebuilding customers through our mortgage banking operations our mortgage banking operations also include separate subsidiaries that broker title insurance and perform title searches in connection with mortgage loan closings for which they receive commissions and fees because nvrm originates mortgage loans almost exclusively for our homebuilding customers nvrm is dependent on our homebuilding segment in 2008 nvrm closed approximately 8600 loans with an aggregate principal amount of approximately 24 billion as compared to 10600 loans with an aggregate principal amount of approximately 32 billion in 2007 

nvrm sells all of the mortgage loans it closes to investors in the secondary markets on a servicing released basis typically within 30 days from the loan closing nvrm is an approved sellerservicer for fnma gnma fhlmc va and fha mortgage loans 

  competition and market factors 

nvrm’s main competition comes from national regional and local mortgage bankers mortgage brokers thrifts and banks in each of these markets nvrm competes primarily on the basis of customer service variety of products offered interest rates offered prices of ancillary services and relative financing availability and costs 

  regulation 

nvrm is an approved sellerservicer of fnma gnma fhlmc fha and va mortgage loans and is subject to all of those agencies’ rules and regulations these rules and regulations restrict certain activities of nvrm nvrm is currently eligible and expects to remain eligible to participate in such programs in addition nvrm is subject to regulation at the state and federal level with respect to specific origination selling and servicing practices 

  pipeline 

nvrm’s mortgage loans in process that have not closed “pipeline” at december 31 2008 and 2007 had an aggregate principal balance of 730 million and 12 billion respectively our cancellation rate was approximately 49 in 2008 during 2007 and 2006 our loan cancellation rates were approximately 45 and 35 respectively we can provide no assurance that the prior year loan cancellation rate is indicative of the actual loan cancellation rate that may occur in 2009 and our loan cancellation rate could continue to increase see “risk factors” in item 1a 

employees 

at december 31 2008 we employed 2845 fulltime persons of whom 1032 were officers and management personnel 190 were technical and construction personnel 645 were sales personnel 426 were administrative personnel and 552 were engaged in various other service and labor activities none of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement and we have never experienced a work stoppage we believe that our employee relations are good

  risk factors 

our business is affected by the risks generally incident to the residential construction business including but not limited to 

 

all of these risks are discussed in detail below 

the homebuilding industry is experiencing a significant downturn the continuation of this downturn could adversely affect our business and our results of operations 

the homebuilding industry has continued to experience a significant downturn as a result of declining consumer confidence driven by an economic recession affordability issues and uncertainty as to the stability of home prices additionally the tightening credit markets have made it more difficult for customers to obtain financing to purchase homes as a result we have experienced reduced demand for new homes these market factors have also resulted in pricing pressures and in turn lower gross profit margins in most of our markets a continued downturn in the homebuilding industry could result in a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

if the market value of our inventory or controlled lot position declines our profit could decrease and we may incur losses 

inventory risk can be substantial for homebuilders the market value of building lots and housing inventories can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing market conditions in addition inventory carrying costs can be significant and can result in losses in a poorly performing project or market we must in the ordinary course of our business continuously seek and make acquisitions of lots for expansion into new markets as well as for replacement and expansion within our current markets which is accomplished by us entering fixed price purchase agreements and paying forfeitable deposits under the purchase agreement to developers for the contractual right to acquire the lots in the event of further adverse changes in economic or market conditions we may cease further building activities in communities or restructure existing purchase agreements resulting in forfeiture of some or all of any remaining land contract deposit paid to the developer either action may result in a loss which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

because almost all of our customers require mortgage financing the availability of suitable mortgage financing could impair the affordability of our homes lower demand for our products and limit our ability to fully deliver our backlog 

our business and earnings depend on the ability of our potential customers to obtain mortgages for the purchase of our homes in addition many of our potential customers must sell their existing homes in order to buy a home from us the tightening of credit standards and the availability of suitable mortgage financing could prevent customers from buying our homes and could prevent buyers of our customers’ homes from obtaining mortgages they need to complete that purchase both of which could result in our potential customers’ inability to buy a home from us if our potential customers or the buyers of our customers’ current homes are not able to obtain suitable financing the result could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

  if our ability to sell mortgages to investors is impaired we may be required to fund these commitments ourselves or may not be able to originate loans at all 

our mortgage segment sells all of the loans it originates into the secondary market usually within 30 days from the date of closing and has up to approximately 110 million available in a repurchase agreement to fund mortgage closings in the event that disruptions to the secondary markets similar to those which occurred during 2007 and 2008 continue to tighten or eliminate the available liquidity within the secondary markets for mortgage loans or the underwriting requirements by our secondary market investors continue to become more stringent our ability to sell future mortgages could decline and we could be required among other things to fund our commitments to our buyers with our own financial resources which is limited or require our home buyers to find another source of financing in addition governmentsponsored enterprises principally fnma and fhlmc play a significant role in buying home mortgages and creating investment securities that they either sell to investors or hold in their portfolios these organizations provide liquidity to the secondary mortgage market the effects of the government takeover of fnma and fhlmc are not yet certain and may restrict or curtail their activities and further disrupt the secondary markets the result of such secondary market disruption could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

interest rate movements inflation and other economic factors can negatively impact our business 

high rates of inflation generally affect the homebuilding industry adversely because of their adverse impact on interest rates high interest rates not only increase the cost of borrowed funds to homebuilders but also have a significant effect on housing demand and on the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective purchasers we are also subject to potential volatility in the price of commodities that impact costs of materials used in our homebuilding business increases in prevailing interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

our financial results also are affected by the risks generally incident to our mortgage banking business including interest rate levels the impact of government regulation on mortgage loan originations and servicing and the need to issue forward commitments to fund and sell mortgage loans our homebuilding customers account for almost all of our mortgage banking business the volume of our continuing homebuilding operations therefore affects our mortgage banking business 

our mortgage banking business also is affected by interest rate fluctuations we also may experience marketing losses resulting from daily increases in interest rates to the extent we are unable to match interest rates and amounts on loans we have committed to originate with forward commitments from third parties to purchase such loans increases in interest rates may have a material adverse effect on our mortgage banking revenue profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

our operations may also be adversely affected by other economic factors within our markets such as negative changes in employment levels job growth and consumer confidence and availability of mortgage financing one or all of which could result in reduced demand or price depression from current levels such negative trends could have a material adverse effect on homebuilding operations 

these factors and thus the homebuilding business have at times in the past been cyclical in nature any downturn in the national economy or the local economies of the markets in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations in particular approximately 34 of our home settlements during 2008 occurred in the washington dc and baltimore md metropolitan areas which accounted for 45 of our homebuilding revenues in 2008 thus we are dependent to a significant extent on the economy and demand for housing in those areas 

  our inability to secure and control an adequate inventory of lots could adversely impact our operations 

the results of our homebuilding operations are dependent upon our continuing ability to control an adequate number of homebuilding lots in desirable locations there can be no assurance that an adequate supply of building lots will continue to be available to us on terms similar to those available in the past or that we will not be required to devote a greater amount of capital to controlling building lots than we have historically an insufficient supply of building lots in one or more of our markets an inability of our developers to deliver finished lots in a timely fashion due to their inability to secure financing to fund development activities or for other reasons or our inability to purchase or finance building lots on reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

volatility in the credit and capital markets may impact our ability to access necessary financing 

our homebuilding operations are dependent in part on the availability and cost of working capital financing and may be adversely affected by a shortage or an increase in the cost of such financing if we require working capital greater than that provided by our operations and our credit facility we may be required to seek to increase the amount available under the facility or to obtain alternative financing no assurance can be given that additional or replacement financing will be available on terms that are favorable or acceptable moreover issues involving liquidity and capital adequacy affecting our lenders could in turn affect our ability to fully access our available credit facilities in addition the credit and capital markets are experiencing significant volatility that is difficult to predict if we are required to seek alternative financing to fund our working capital requirements continued volatility in these markets may restrict our flexibility to access financing if we are at any time unsuccessful in obtaining sufficient capital to fund our planned homebuilding expenditures we may experience a substantial delay in the completion of any homes then under construction or we may be unable to control or purchase finished building lots any delay could result in cost increases and could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

our mortgage banking operations are dependent on the availability cost and other terms of mortgage financing facilities and may be adversely affected by any shortage or increased cost of such financing no assurance can be given that any additional or replacement financing will be available on terms that are favorable or acceptable our mortgage banking operations are also dependent upon the securitization market for mortgagebacked securities and could be materially adversely affected by any fluctuation or downturn in such market 

our current indebtedness may impact our future operations 

our existing indebtedness contains financial and other restrictive covenants and any future indebtedness may also contain covenants these covenants include limitations on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness pay cash dividends and make distributions make loans and investments enter into transactions with affiliates effect certain asset sales incur certain liens merge or consolidate with any other person or transfer all or substantially all of our properties and assets substantial losses by us or other action or inaction by us or our subsidiaries could result in the violation of one or more of these covenants which could result in decreased liquidity or a default on our indebtedness thereby having a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

  government regulations and environmental matters could negatively affect our operations 

we are subject to various local state and federal statutes ordinances rules and regulations concerning zoning building design construction and similar matters including local regulations that impose restrictive zoning and density requirements in order to limit the number of homes that can eventually be built within the boundaries of a particular area these regulations may further increase the cost to produce and market our products in addition we have from time to time been subject to and may also be subject in the future to periodic delays in our homebuilding projects due to building moratoriums in the areas in which we operate changes in regulations that restrict homebuilding activities in one or more of our principal markets could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

we are also subject to a variety of local state and federal statutes ordinances rules and regulations concerning the protection of health and the environment we are subject to a variety of environmental conditions that can affect our business and our homebuilding projects the particular environmental laws that apply to any given homebuilding site vary greatly according to the location and environmental condition of the site and the present and former uses of the site and adjoining properties environmental laws and conditions may result in delays cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs or prohibit or severely restrict homebuilding activity in certain environmentally sensitive regions or areas thereby adversely affecting our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

we are an approved sellerservicer of fnma gnma fhlmc fha and va mortgage loans and are subject to all of those agencies’ rules and regulations any significant impairment of our eligibility to sellservice these loans could have a material adverse impact on our mortgage operations in addition we are subject to regulation at the state and federal level with respect to specific origination selling and servicing practices including the real estate settlement and protection act adverse changes in governmental regulation may have a negative impact on our mortgage loan origination business 

we face competition in our housing and mortgage banking operations 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive we compete with numerous homebuilders of varying size ranging from local to national in scope some of whom have greater financial resources than we do we face competition 

 

our homebuilding operations compete primarily on the basis of price location design quality service and reputation 

the mortgage banking industry is also competitive our main competition comes from national regional and local mortgage bankers thrifts banks and mortgage brokers in each of these markets our mortgage banking operations compete primarily on the basis of customer service variety of products offered interest rates offered prices of ancillary services and relative financing availability and costs 

there can be no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully in our homebuilding or mortgage banking operations an inability to effectively compete may have an adverse impact on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

a shortage of building materials or labor or increases in materials or labor costs may adversely impact our operations 

the homebuilding business has from time to time experienced building material and labor shortages including shortages in insulation drywall certain carpentry work and concrete as well as fluctuating lumber prices and supply in addition high employment levels and strong construction market conditions could restrict the labor force available to our subcontractors and us in one or more of our markets significant increases in costs resulting from these shortages or delays in construction of homes could have a material adverse effect upon our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

  product liability litigation and warranty claims may adversely impact our operations 

construction defect and home warranty claims are common and can represent a substantial risk for the homebuilding industry the cost of insuring against construction defect and product liability claims as well as the claims themselves can be high in addition insurance companies limit coverage offered to protect against these claims further restrictions on coverage availability or significant increases in premium costs or claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

we are subject to litigation proceedings that could harm our business if an unfavorable ruling were to occur 

from time to time we may become involved in litigation and other legal proceedings relating to claims arising from our operations in the normal course of business as described in but not limited to part i item 3 “legal proceedings” of this 10k we are currently subject to certain legal proceedings litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings may occur we cannot assure you that these or other litigation or legal proceedings will not materially affect our ability to conduct our business in the manner that we expect or otherwise adversely affect us should an unfavorable ruling occur 

changes in tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws may negatively affect our operating results 

the effects of possible changes in the tax laws or changes in their interpretation could have a material negative impact on our financial results 

weatherrelated and other events beyond our control may adversely impact our operations 

extreme weather or other events such as hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes forest fires floods terrorist attacks or war may affect our markets our operations and our profitability these events may impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or subcontractors causing us material increases in costs or delays in construction of homes which could have a material adverse effect upon our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows

none 




 item 2 properties 

our corporate offices are located in reston virginia where we currently lease approximately 61000 square feet of office space of which approximately 9800 square feet we have subleased to a third party the current corporate office lease expires in april 2015 

in connection with the operation of the homebuilding segment we lease manufacturing facilities in the following six locations thurmont maryland burlington county new jersey farmington new york kings mountain north carolina darlington pennsylvania and portland tennessee these facilities range in size from approximately 40000 square feet to 400000 square feet and combined total approximately 1000000 square feet of manufacturing space each of these leases contains various options for extensions of the lease and for the purchase of the facility the portland lease expires in 2009 the thurmont and farmington leases expire in 2014 and the kings mountain and burlington county leases expire in 2023 and 2024 respectively the darlington lease expires in 2025 due to the economic downturn and the related decline in our homebuilding activity our current plant utilization has dropped to approximately 40 of total capacity 

  we also in connection with both our homebuilding and mortgage banking businesses lease office space in multiple locations for homebuilding divisional offices and mortgage banking and title services branches under leases expiring at various times through 2014 none of which are individually material to our business we anticipate that upon expiration of existing leases we will be able to renew them or obtain comparable facilities on acceptable terms 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

on july 18 2007 former employees filed lawsuits against us in the court of common pleas in allegheny county pennsylvania and hamilton county ohio in the superior court in durham county north carolina and in the circuit court in montgomery county maryland and on july 19 2007 in the superior court in new jersey alleging that we incorrectly classified our sales and marketing representatives as being exempt from overtime wages these lawsuits are similar in nature to another lawsuit filed on october 29 2004 by another former employee in the united states district court for the western district of new york the complaints seek injunctive relief an award of unpaid wages including fringe benefits liquidated damages equal to the overtime wages allegedly due and not paid attorney and other fees and interest and where available multiple damages the suits were filed as purported class actions however none of the groups of employees that the lawsuits purport to represent have been certified as a class the lawsuits filed in ohio pennsylvania maryland and new jersey have been stayed pending further developments in the new york action 

we believe that our compensation practices in regard to sales and marketing representatives are entirely lawful and in compliance with two letter rulings from the united states department of labor “dol” issued in january 2007 the two courts to most recently consider similar claims against other homebuilders have acknowledged the dol’s position that sales and marketing representatives were properly classified as exempt from overtime wages and the only court to have directly addressed the exempt status of such employees concluded that the dol’s position was valid accordingly we have vigorously defended and intend to continue to vigorously defend these lawsuits because we are unable to determine the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome of this case or the amount of damages if any we have not recorded any associated liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 

we are also involved in various other litigation arising in the ordinary course of business in the opinion of management and based on advice of legal counsel this litigation is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations

overview 

business 

our primary business is the construction and sale of singlefamily detached homes townhomes and condominium buildings to fully serve customers of our homebuilding operations we also operate a mortgage banking and title services business we primarily conduct our operations in mature supplyconstrained markets additionally we generally grow our business through market share gains in our existing markets and by expanding into markets contiguous to our current active markets our four homebuilding reportable segments consist of the following regions 

 

we believe we operate our business with a conservative operating strategy we do not engage in land development and primarily construct homes on a presold basis this strategy allows us to maximize inventory turnover which enables us to minimize market risk and to operate with less capital thereby enhancing rates of return on equity and total capital in addition we focus on obtaining and maintaining a leading market position in each market we serve this strategy allows us to gain valuable efficiencies and competitive advantages in our markets which we believe contributes to minimizing the adverse effects of regional economic cycles and provides growth opportunities within these markets 

because we do not development land our continued success is contingent upon our ability to control an adequate supply of finished lots on which to build and on our developers’ ability to timely deliver finished lots to meet the sales demands of our customers we acquire finished building lots at market prices from various land developers under purchase agreements these purchase agreements require deposits typically ranging up to 10 of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots in the form of cash or letters of credit that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the purchase agreement however we believe that this lot acquisition strategy avoids the financial requirements and risks associated with direct land ownership and development as of december 31 2008 we controlled approximately 45000 lots with deposits in cash and letters of credit totaling approximately 178000 and 5000 respectively included in the number of controlled lots are approximately 17000 lots for which we have recorded a contract land deposit impairment reserve of approximately 147900 as of december 31 2008 see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information regarding contract land deposits 

overview of current business environment 

the homebuilding environment in 2008 was characterized by high levels of existing and new homes available for sale driven by slowed demand and record foreclosure rates by the end of 2008 industry wide new home construction as reported by the commerce department had fallen to historically low levels homebuyer confidence continues to be negatively impacted by concerns regarding the current economic recession higher levels of unemployment and a continuing decline in home values in each of the markets we serve the sales of new and existing homes also continue to be adversely impacted by a more restrictive mortgage lending environment that has made it more difficult for our customers to obtain mortgage financing as well as making it difficult to sell their current homes affordability also remains an issue despite falling home prices because of required higher downpayments to secure financing our markets have also been negatively impacted by homebuilders reducing prices in an effort to reduce new home inventories and competition from foreclosed properties the combined effect of these market conditions has exerted substantial downward pressure on both new orders and selling prices 

  as a result of these deteriorating market conditions new orders for 2008 were down 29 from the prior year and we experienced a continuation of the higher cancellation rates we experienced in 2007 cancellation rates in 2008 were 23 as compared to 21 in 2007 in response we increased incentives to homebuyers and reduced prices in many of our markets these pricing pressures led to a 12 decrease in the average selling price for new orders in 2008 as compared to 2007 new orders and the average selling prices were down in each of our market segments with the largest decline in new orders being experienced in our south east market segment which saw a decline in new orders of 45 year over year 

throughout 2008 we have continued to work with our developers to reduce lot prices to current market values andor to defer scheduled lot purchases to coincide with our slower than expected sales pace in communities where we are unsuccessful in negotiating necessary adjustments to the purchase agreements to meet current market prices we may exit the community and forfeit our deposit under the applicable purchase agreement in addition we may also forfeit our deposit in a community we are not exiting in order to restructure a purchase agreement to current market prices during 2008 we incurred contract land deposit impairment charges of approximately 165000 from actual or expected terminations or from restructured purchase agreements where we forfeited or determined we would forfeit the deposit in 2007 contract land deposit impairment charges totaled approximately 261800 as noted above as of december 31 2008 we had a reserve of approximately 148000 on outstanding contract land deposits related to approximately 17000 lots these lots are included in the total number of lots controlled mentioned above the total number of lots controlled at december 31 2008 is down 33 from approximately 67600 lots at december 31 2007 due to the termination of certain purchase agreements and a reduced pace of entering into new lot purchase agreements to coincide with our slower than expected sales pace 

consolidated revenues for 2008 decreased 28 to 3693039 from 5129342 in 2007 net income for 2008 was 100892 1704 per diluted share compared to net income of 333955 5414 per diluted share in 2007 a 70 decrease in net income and a 69 decrease in diluted earnings per share gross profit margins within our homebuilding business decreased to 126 in 2008 from 163 in 2007 gross profit margins have been negatively impacted by the aforementioned lower selling prices and increased incentives and continue to trend lower additionally gross profit margins were negatively impacted by the contract land deposit impairment charges in both 2008 and 2007 as discussed above 

we expect to continue to experience downward pressure on sales and selling prices over at least the next several quarters in all of our market segments due to current market conditions and uncertainties surrounding the effectiveness of the government’s stimulus package to slow the decline in home values reduce foreclosure rates and boost consumer confidence we in turn expect these sales and pricing pressures to continue to negatively impact gross profit margins in future periods to offset these declining selling prices and customer affordability issues we continue to aggressively work with our vendors to reduce material and labor costs incurred in the construction process alter product offerings when appropriate and focus on reducing lot costs as discussed above in addition we continue to take aggressive action to lower overhead costs relative to our peak levels in 2006 we have reduced headcount by 53 and the number of homebuilding divisions we operate by 39 we will continue to assess and adjust our staffing levels and organizational structure as conditions warrant 

  homebuilding operations 

the following table summarizes the results of our consolidated homebuilding operations and certain operating activity for each of the last three years 

 

consolidated homebuilding revenues 

homebuilding revenues for 2008 decreased 28 from 2007 primarily as a result of a 21 decrease in the number of homes settled and a 9 decrease in the average settlement price the decrease in the number of units settled is primarily attributable to our beginning backlog units being approximately 19 lower entering 2008 as compared to the beginning backlog units entering 2007 and lower new orders year over year average settlement prices were impacted primarily by a 10 lower average price of homes in the beginning backlog entering 2008 as compared to the same period in 2007 and also by lower average sales prices for new orders in 2008 as compared to 2007 

homebuilding revenues for 2007 decreased 16 from 2006 primarily as a result of an 11 decrease in the number of homes settled and a 6 decrease in the average settlement price these decreases were driven primarily by a 23 lower number of units in backlog and a 7 lower average price of units in backlog at the beginning of 2007 as compared to the beginning of 2006 

consolidated homebuilding new orders 

new orders and the average sales price of new orders decreased 29 and 12 respectively in 2008 as compared to 2007 both the number of new orders and the average selling prices have been negatively impacted by the aforementioned challenging market conditions new orders were also negatively impacted by a 16 decrease in the average number of active communities year over year to 427 in 2008 from 505 in 2007 and a reduction in traffic per community year over year as noted above we expect to continue to experience downward pressure on sales and selling prices over at least the next several quarters in all of our market segments due to current market conditions 

the number of new orders for 2007 and the average selling price of new orders each decreased 7 when compared to 2006 the challenging market conditions which began to deteriorate in the second half of 2005 led to an increase in cancellation rates year over year to 21 in 2007 from 19 in 2006 and in turn negatively impacted new orders in 2007 additionally we noted a significant increase in the cancellation rates in the fourth quarter of 2007 to 32 from 20 in the fourth quarter of 2006 these increases in cancellation rates were driven by continued tightening of mortgage underwriting standards and financing availability which impacted not only our customers’ ability to secure financing for their new home purchase but also has impacted our customers’ ability to sell their existing homes leading to contract cancellations sales were also negatively impacted by a 14 reduction in the average number of active communities in 2007 down to 505 from 589 in 2006 the decrease in the average number of active communities was a result of the termination of certain purchase agreements and a reduced pace of entering into new lot option contracts due to uncertainties within the homebuilding market and its impact on the market value of land 

  consolidated homebuilding gross profit 

gross profit margins in 2008 declined to 126 compared to 163 in 2007 despite lower contract land deposit impairment charges in 2008 of approximately 165000 or 454 basis points compared to approximately 261800 or 519 basis points in 2007 the decline in gross profit margins was primarily driven by continued pressure on selling prices as a result of the aforementioned challenging market conditions as discussed above we expect these challenging market conditions to continue for at least the next several quarters exerting downward pressure on new orders selling prices and in turn also on our gross profit margins 

gross profit margins declined to 163 in 2007 from 221 in 2006 gross profit margins were negatively impacted in 2007 by lower selling prices created by the aforementioned difficult market conditions additionally gross profit margins were negatively impacted by the contract land deposit impairment charges in 2007 of 261800 or 519 basis points as compared to 173800 in 2006 or 288 basis points

sga expenses in 2008 decreased approximately 34800 or 10 from 2007 but increased as a percentage of revenue to 85 in 2008 from 68 in 2007 the decrease in sga expenses is attributable to a decrease in selling and marketing costs of approximately 31000 related to the previously mentioned 16 reduction in the average number of active communities in 2008 compared to 2007 in addition personnel costs decreased approximately 20000 as a result of lower staffing levels and lower management incentive costs year over year these declines were offset partially by an increase of approximately 24600 in stockbased compensation expense in 2008 compared to 2007 this increase is attributable to the reversal of approximately 28450 in sga classified stockbased compensation costs in the third quarter of 2007 related to approximately 400000 outstanding stock options which were subject to a performance metric which we determined in 2007 would not be achieved see note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the performance based stock option grants 

sga expenses in 2007 decreased approximately 88800 or 21 from 2006 and as a percentage of revenue decreased to 68 in 2007 from 72 in 2006 the decrease in sga expenses is partially attributable to an approximate 36300 decrease in personnel costs this decrease resulted from a reduction in staffing levels to meet current and expected levels of sales activity and lower incentive compensation costs of approximately 9200 year over year in addition sga costs were favorably impacted by a reduction of approximately 39800 in stockbased compensation costs in 2007 as compared to 2006 as discussed above during 2007 we determined that is was improbable that we would achieve the performance metric related to approximately 400000 outstanding stock options this determination resulted in the reversal of approximately 28450 in sga related stockbased compensation in addition because it was expected that none of the outstanding stock options that were subject to the performance metric would vest we did not record any additional compensation costs related to these options in the fourth quarter of 2007 sga costs were also favorably impacted by a reduction in marketing costs of approximately 10000 in 2007 from 2006 due to the aforementioned 14 reduction in the average number of active communities in the current year 

consolidated homebuilding backlog 

backlog units and dollars were 3164 and 1002795 respectively as of december 31 2008 compared to 5145 and 1910504 as of december 31 2007 the 39 decrease in backlog units is attributable to our beginning backlog units being approximately 19 lower entering 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 in addition backlog units have been negatively impacted by the aforementioned 29 decline in new orders year over year backlog dollars were negatively impacted by the decrease in backlog units coupled with a 15 decrease in the average price of homes in ending backlog resulting primarily from an 8 decrease in the average selling price for new orders over the sixmonth period ended december 31 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 

  the net new order and settlement activity for 2007 resulted in a decrease in backlog units and dollars to 5145 and 1910504 respectively at december 31 2007 compared to 6388 units and 2634720 respectively at december 31 2006 the 27 decrease in backlog dollars was attributable to the 19 decrease in backlog units and an 11 decrease in the average price of new orders for the sixmonth period ended december 31 2007 as compared to the same period in 2006 

consolidated homebuilding — other charges 

we reassessed our goodwill and intangible asset balances for impairment in the fourth quarter of 2008 as a result of the continuing declines in new orders and backlog as discussed above and the continuing deterioration of the homebuilding environment in each of our markets spurred further in 2008 by the credit crisis in the latter part of 2008 as a result of this assessment it was determined that the goodwill and intangible assets related to our rymarc homes and fox ridge homes operations were fully impaired and we wroteoff a total of 11686 related to such assets in 2008 

reportable homebuilding segments 

homebuilding profit before tax includes all revenues and income generated from the sale of homes less the cost of homes sold sga expenses and a corporate capital allocation charge determined at the corporate headquarters the corporate capital allocation charge eliminates in consolidation is based on the segment’s average net assets employed and is charged using a consistent methodology in the years presented the corporate capital allocation charged to the operating segment allows the chief operating decision maker as defined in statement of financial accounting standards no 131 “disclosure about segments of an enterprise and related information” to determine whether the operating segment’s results are providing the desired rate of return after covering our cost of capital we record charges on contract land deposits when we determine that it is probable that recovery of the deposit is impaired for segment reporting purposes impairments on contract land deposits are generally charged to the operating segment upon the determination to terminate a lot purchase agreement with the developer or to restructure a purchase agreement resulting in the forfeiture of the deposit the following tables summarize certain homebuilding operating activity by reportable segment for each of the last three years

segment new orders were down 8 in 2007 from 2006 and the average selling price declined by 9 new orders in the washington dc and baltimore md submarkets declined 12 and 6 respectively these declines were primarily the result of a competitive selling environment driven by a market which continued to deteriorate throughout 2007 as discussed above in the overview section the mortgage market turmoil in 2007 impacted the availability of jumbo mortgage products which represented approximately 39 of all mortgages closed in the washington dc submarket within this segment these market conditions put significant downward pressure on selling prices and contributed to higher levels of cancellations within these markets cancellation rates for the mid atlantic segment increased to 25 in 2007 from 23 in 2006 with the highest cancellation rates occurring in the washington dc submarket where the cancellation rates increased to 31 in 2007 from 29 in 2006 additionally cancellation rates in the washington dc submarket increased in the fourth quarter of 2007 to 46 as compared to 34 in the fourth quarter of 2006 the net new order and settlement activity for 2007 resulted in a 26 decrease in backlog units at december 31 2007 as compared to the same period in 2006 backlog dollars decreased 33 year over year due to the decrease in backlog units and additionally to a 12 decrease in the average selling price for new orders for the sixmonth period ended december 31 2007 as compared to the same period in 2006

segment new orders and the average new order sales price decreased 45 and 10 respectively during 2008 compared to 2007 market conditions within the south east segment continued to deteriorate throughout 2008 these worsening market conditions have resulted in lower sales absorption rates within our active communities and higher cancellation rates year over year new orders were negatively impacted by a 10 decrease in the average number of active communities to 65 in 2008 from 73 in 2007 within the segment cancellation rates in the overall segment increased to 29 in 2008 from 20 in 2007 the 45 decrease in new orders for 2008 coupled with a 12 lower beginning backlog balance entering 2008 compared to 2007 resulted in a 56 decrease in backlog units as of december 31 2008 compared to december 31 2007 the decrease in backlog units coupled with a decline of 16 in the average backlog price has resulted in a 63 decline in backlog dollars year over year 

2007 versus 2006 

the south east segment had an approximate 9800 or 12 increase in segment profit from 2006 revenues for the segment increased approximately 68100 or 12 as a result of a 16 increase in the average settlement price offset partially by a 4 decrease in the number of units settled the increase in the average settlement price is attributable to a 20 higher average price of homes in beginning backlog for 2007 as compared to 2006 the higher value of homes in beginning backlog was attributable to favorable market conditions in the prior year which allowed us to increase sales prices as well as a general shift in sales within the segment to a larger higher priced product the number of settlements is down primarily due to the 2007 beginning backlog being 4 lower than backlog at the beginning of 2006 gross profit margin percentage for the segment in 2007 remained flat with 2006 at 220 

segment new orders were down 6 year over year while the average new order price for 2007 increased 10 from 2006 although the south east segment was not as severely impacted by the adverse economic conditions experienced in our other reporting segments during the first half of 2007 continued tightening in the credit markets and declining consumer confidence contributed to increased downward pressure on selling prices and higher levels of cancellations within this segment new orders were negatively impacted by a 37 decline in new orders in the fourth quarter of 2007 as compared to the same period in 2006 as market conditions grew more challenging within the south east segment the cancellation rate in the fourth quarter of 2007 increased to 36 compared to 18 in the same period in 2006 in addition the average selling price of new orders in the fourth quarter of 2007 was down 2 from the same period in 2006 the net new order and settlement activity for 2007 resulted in a 12 decrease in backlog units at december 31 2007 as compared to december 31 2006 backlog dollars were down 6 at december 31 2007 as compared the december 31 2006 due to the lower backlog unit balance offset partially by a 4 increase in the average sales price of new orders for the sixmonth period ended december 31 2007 as compared to the same period in 2006 

  homebuilding segment reconciliations to consolidated homebuilding operations 

in addition to the corporate capital allocation and contract land deposit impairments discussed above the other reconciling items between homebuilding segment profit and homebuilding consolidated profit before tax include unallocated corporate overhead which includes all management incentive compensation stock option compensation expense goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges consolidation adjustments and external corporate interest expense our overhead functions such as accounting treasury human resources land acquisition etc are centrally performed and the costs are not allocated to our operating segments consolidation adjustments consist of such items to convert the reportable segments’ results which are predominantly maintained on a cash basis to a full accrual basis for external financial statement presentation purposes and are not allocated to our operating segments likewise stock option compensation expense and goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges are not charged to the operating segments external corporate interest expense is primarily comprised of interest charges on our outstanding senior notes and working capital line borrowings and are not charged to the operating segments because the charges are included in the corporate capital allocation discussed above

  mortgage banking segment 

we conduct our mortgage banking activity through nvr mortgage finance inc “nvrm” a wholly owned subsidiary nvrm focuses almost exclusively on serving the homebuilding segment’s customer base following is a table of financial and statistical data for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 

 

2008 versus 2007 

loan closing volume for the year ended december 31 2008 decreased 27 from 2007 the 2008 decrease was primarily attributable to a 19 decrease in the number of units closed and a 10 decrease in the average loan amount year over year these decreases are attributable to the aforementioned decrease in the homebuilding segment’s number of units settled and average settlement prices in 2008 as compared to 2007 

segment profit for the year ended december 31 2008 decreased approximately 25300 from 2007 the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in mortgage banking fees attributable to the aforementioned decrease in closed loan volume and a reduction in fees charged to customers to assist our selling efforts in the homebuilding segment the decrease to mortgage banking fees was partially offset by 31 basis point increase in fees received for servicing released premiums as a result of the product mix shift towards fixed rate mortgages partly driven by an increase in the use of fha fixed rate loan products which generally carry a higher servicing released premium than other nonfha loan products 

the decrease to mortgage banking fees for the year ended december 31 2008 was also partially offset by an approximate 900 increase in unrealized income from the fair value measurement of our locked loan commitments forward mortgagebacked securities sales and closed loans held for sale which is included in mortgage banking fees the fair value measurement was the result of the adoption of staff accounting bulletin no 109 “written loan commitments recorded at fair value through earnings” “sab no 109” and fasb statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 157 “fair value measurement” both of which the company adopted on a prospective basis as of january 1 2008 as a result of the adoption of sab no 109 and sfas no 157 the fair value measurement for locked loan commitments and closed loans held for sale now includes the assumed gainloss on the expected resultant loan sale and the value of the servicing rights associated with the loan this is in addition to the prior fair value measurement which only considered the effects of interest rate movements between the date of the rate lock and either the loan closing date or the balance sheet date each of the aforementioned fair value calculations are classified as level 2 observable inputs as defined in sfas no 157 the fair value measurement will be impacted in the future by the change in volume and product mix of our locked loan commitments 

  stock option expense increased by approximately 1900 for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to 2007 as noted below this was due to a 2007 reversal of approximately 2150 of pretax stock based compensation costs see details below there were no additional adjustments in 2008 

2007 versus 2006 

loan closing volume for the year ended december 31 2007 decreased 18 from 2006 the 2007 decrease was primarily attributable to a 13 decrease in the number of units closed and a 5 decrease in the average loan amount year over year these decreases are attributable to the aforementioned decrease in the homebuilding segment’s number of units settled and average settlement prices in 2007 as compared to 2006 the number of units closed was also adversely impacted by a 1 decrease in nvr’s capture rate in 2007 

segment profit for the year ended december 31 2007 decreased approximately 14200 from 2006 the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in mortgage banking fees attributable to the aforementioned decrease in closed loan volume and a reduction in fees charged to customers to assist our selling efforts in the homebuilding segment the decrease to mortgage banking fees was partially offset by an approximate 5400 decrease in costs during 2007 related to the contractual repayment of loan sale income to investors for loans that were paid in full within a set number of days following the sale of the loan and an increase in the percentage of fixed rate loans in the product mix traditionally fixed rate mortgages have been more profitable than adjustable rate mortgages in the second half of 2006 with the change in interest rates the rate differential between fixed rate and adjustable rate mortgages narrowed as a result we saw a shift to these more profitable products which remained favorable throughout 2007 

as noted above due to the continued earnings decline resulting from the deterioration in market conditions and our expectation that market conditions would not improve in the near term the 2007 yeartodate nvrm results were impacted by the determination that it was improbable that we would achieve the performance metric related to certain outstanding stock options this determination resulted in the reversal of approximately 2150 of pretax stockbased compensation costs recognized in prior periods 

mortgage banking — other 

nvrm is dependent on our homebuilding segment’s customers for business as sales and selling prices of the homebuilding segment decline nvrm’s operations are likewise adversely affected in many cases nvrm is reducing the fees charged to its borrowers in an effort to assist our selling efforts and is likely to continue doing so in the foreseeable future which will adversely impact the mortgage segment’s future results in addition nvrm’s operating results may be adversely affected in future periods due to the continued tightening and volatility of the credit markets 

in november 2008 the united states department of housing and urban development “hud” published a final rule amending its real estate settlement and protection act “respa” regulations the rule among other things revised the definition of “required use” the result of which is the prohibition of homebuilding companies with affiliated mortgage companies from offering discounts to their customers if those customers use the affiliated mortgage company this provision of the rule was originally scheduled to be effective january 16 2009 however in january 2009 hud issued a final rule delaying the effective date until april 16 2009 due to litigation surrounding the revised definition of “required use” if the revised definition of “required use” is adopted by hud as currently proposed it could have a material impact on nvrm’s operations including its financial results and its capture rate 

seasonality 

overall we do not experience material seasonal fluctuations in sales settlements or loan closings 

  effective tax rate 

our consolidated effective tax rate in 2008 2007 and 2006 was 3975 381 and 390 respectively the higher effective tax rate in 2008 is primarily due to the reduction in tax exempt interest income and lower pretax income in 2008 as compared to 2007 in february 2009 dwight c schar relinquished his executive officer role with the company as a result a tax benefit will be generated in 2009 related to compensation expense recorded for certain outstanding option grants held by mr schar that was previously considered to be a permanent nondeductible tax difference this is expected to result in a decrease in the 2009 effective tax rate

  up to 150000 of the facility is currently available for issuance in the form of letters of credit of which 13421 was outstanding at december 31 2008 the facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants the negative covenants include among others certain limitations on transactions involving the creation of guarantees sale of assets acquisitions mergers investments and land purchases additional covenants include i a minimum adjusted consolidated tangible net worth requirement ii a maximum leverage ratio requirement and iii an interest coverage ratio requirement these covenants restrict the amount that we would be able to pay in dividends each year we are also subject to borrowing base restrictions if our senior debt rating falls below investment grade at december 31 2008 we were in compliance with all covenants under the facility and we have maintained our investment grade rating on our senior debt additionally at december 31 2008 there were no borrowing base limitations reducing the amount available to us for borrowings and we had no direct borrowings outstanding under the facility 

nvr’s mortgage banking segment provides for its mortgage origination and other operating activities using cash generated from operations as well as a revolving mortgage repurchase facility on august 5 2008 nvrm entered into a master repurchase agreement with us bank national association as agent and representative of itself as a buyer and the other buyers the “repurchase agreement” the repurchase agreement replaced nvrm’s warehouse credit facility which was set to expire on august 21 2008 the repurchase agreement provides for loan purchases up to 110000 subject to certain sublimits in addition the repurchase agreement provides for an accordion feature under which nvrm may request that the aggregate commitments under the repurchase agreement be increased to an amount up to 150000 the repurchase agreement is used to fund nvrm’s mortgage origination activities under which 44539 was outstanding at december 31 2008 as of december 31 2008 the borrowing base limitation reduced the amount available to us for borrowing to approximately 67000 the repurchase agreement expires on august 4 2009 advances under the repurchase agreement carry a pricing rate based on the libor rate plus the libor margin or at nvrm’s option the balance funded rate as these terms are defined in the repurchase agreement the weightedaverage pricing rate for amounts outstanding under the repurchase agreement was 29 during 2008 the average pricing rate for amounts outstanding at december 31 2008 was 19 the repurchase agreement contains various affirmative and negative covenants the negative covenants include among others certain limitations on transactions involving acquisitions mergers the incurrence of debt sale of assets and creation of liens upon any of its mortgage notes additional covenants include i a tangible net worth requirement ii a minimum liquidity requirement all of which we were compliant with at december 31 2008 

on june 17 2003 we completed an offering at par for 200000 of 5 senior notes due 2010 the “notes” under a shelf registration statement filed in 1998 with the securities and exchange commission the “sec” the notes mature on june 15 2010 and bear interest at 5 payable semiannually in arrears on june 15 and december 15 commencing on december 15 2003 the notes are general unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness and indebtedness under our working capital credit facility the notes are senior in right of payment to any future subordinated indebtedness that we may incur we may redeem the notes in whole or in part at any time upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days notice at a redemption price equal to the greater of a 100 of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed or b the discounted present value of the remaining scheduled payments of the notes to be redeemed plus in each case accrued and unpaid interest the indenture governing the notes contains certain covenants which among other items restricts our ability to i create incur assume or guarantee any secured debt ii enter into sale and leaseback transactions and iii merge with or into other companies or sell all or substantially all of our assets at december 31 2008 we were in compliance with all covenants under the notes on december 22 2008 we repurchased 36680 of the notes on the open market at 9925 of par resulting in a pretax gain of approximately 251 

on september 8 2008 we filed a shelf registration statement the “2008 shelf registration” with the sec to register for future offer and sale an unlimited amount of debt securities common shares preferred shares depositary shares representing preferred shares and warrants we expect to use the proceeds received from future offerings issued under the 2008 shelf registration for general corporate purposes this discussion of nvr’s shelf registration capacity does not constitute an offer of any securities for sale 

  equity repurchases 

in addition to funding growth in our homebuilding and mortgage banking operations we historically have used a substantial portion of our excess liquidity to repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock in open market and privately negotiated transactions this ongoing repurchase activity is conducted pursuant to publicly announced board authorizations and is typically executed in accordance with the safeharbor provisions of rule 10b18 of the securities and exchange act of 1934 as amended in addition the board resolutions authorizing us to repurchase shares of our common stock specifically prohibit us from purchasing shares from our officers directors profit sharing401k plan trust or employee stock ownership plan trust the repurchase program assists us in accomplishing our primary objective creating increases in shareholder value we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock during 2008 

cash flows 

for the year ended december 31 2008 our operating activities provided cash of 462361 cash was provided primarily by homebuilding operations and a reduction in our homebuilding inventories of approximately 288000 due to a reduction in the number of homes under construction at the end of 2008 as compared to the same period in 2007 cash was also provided by an approximate 34000 decrease in mortgage loans held for sale operating cash flow for the current year was reduced by a decrease in our customer deposits of approximately 66000 the presentation of operating cash flows was also reduced by approximately 50000 which is the amount of the excess tax benefit realized from the exercise of stock options during the period and credited directly to additional paid in capital as required by sfas 123r which we adopted effective january 1 2006 excess tax benefits credited directly to additionalpaidin capital resulting from stockbased compensation must be presented as an operating cash outflow and a financing cash inflow 

net cash used for investing activities was 5498 for the year ended december 31 2008 and was used primarily for property and equipment purchases 

net cash provided by financing activities was 26571 for the year ended december 31 2008 financing cash flow was favorably impacted by approximately 52000 of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the realization of approximately 50000 in excess income tax benefits from the exercise of stock options which pursuant to sfas 123r must be reported as a financing cash inflow we reduced net borrowings under the mortgage warehouse facility by approximately 39000 and we repurchased approximately 36700 of our 5 senior notes due 2010 at a cost of approximately 36400 

at december 31 2008 the homebuilding segment had restricted cash of 4539 which relates to customer deposits on certain home sales 

we believe that cash generated from operations and borrowings available under our credit facilities will be sufficient to satisfy near and long term cash requirements for working capital and debt service in both our homebuilding and mortgage banking operations 

off balance sheet arrangements 

lot acquisition strategy 

we do not engage in land development instead we acquire finished building lots at market prices from various land developers under fixed price purchase agreements that require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the agreement the deposits required under the purchase agreements are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percentage typically ranging up to 10 of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots 

  we believe that our lot acquisition strategy reduces the financial requirements and risks associated with direct land ownership and land development we may at our option choose for any reason and at any time not to perform under these purchase agreements by delivering notice of our intent not to acquire the finished lots under contract our sole legal obligation and economic loss for failure to perform under these purchase agreements is limited to the amount of the deposit pursuant to the liquidating damage provision contained within the purchase agreements we do not have any financial guarantees or completion obligations and we do not guarantee lot purchases on a specific performance basis under these purchase agreements 

at december 31 2008 we controlled approximately 45000 lots with an aggregate purchase price of approximately 4100000 by making or committing to make deposits of approximately 201000 in the form of cash and letters of credit our entire risk of loss pertaining to the aggregate 4100000 contractual commitment resulting from our nonperformance under the contracts is limited to the 183000 deposit paid plus the additional 18000 deposits referred to below of the 201000 deposit total approximately 178000 in cash and approximately 5000 in letters of credit have been issued as of december 31 2008 and subsequent to december 31 2008 we will pay 18000 in additional deposits assuming that contractual development milestones are met by the developers see contractual obligations section below as of december 31 2008 we had recorded an impairment valuation allowance of approximately 148000 related to the cash deposits currently outstanding please refer to note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of the contract land deposits and note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our lot acquisition strategy in relation to our accounting under fin 46r “consolidation of variable interest entities” 

bonds and letters of credit 

we enter into bond or letter of credit arrangements with local municipalities government agencies or land developers to collateralize our obligations under various contracts we had 30403 of contingent obligations under such agreements as of december 31 2008 inclusive of the 5000 of lot acquisition deposits in the form of letters of credit discussed above we believe we will fulfill our obligations under the related contracts and do not anticipate any material losses under these bonds or letters of credit 

mortgage commitments and forward sales 

in the normal course of business our mortgage banking segment enters into contractual commitments to extend credit to buyers of singlefamily homes with fixed expiration dates the commitments become effective when the borrowers “lockin” a specified interest rate within time frames established by nvr all mortgagors are evaluated for credit worthiness prior to the extension of the commitment market risk arises if interest rates move adversely between the time of the “lockin” of rates by the borrower and the sale date of the loan to a brokerdealer to mitigate the effect of the interest rate risk inherent in providing rate lock commitments to borrowers we enter into optional or mandatory delivery forward sale contracts to sell whole loans and mortgagebacked securities to brokerdealers the forward sale contracts lock in an interest rate and price for the sale of loans similar to the specific rate lock commitments nvr does not engage in speculative or trading derivative activities both the rate lock commitments to borrowers and the forward sale contracts to brokerdealers are undesignated derivatives and accordingly are marked to fair value through earnings at december 31 2008 there were contractual commitments to extend credit to borrowers aggregating approximately 109000 and open forward delivery sale contracts aggregating approximately 159000 please refer to note 11 in the consolidated financial statements included herein for a description of our fair value accounting calculation under sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” and staff accounting bulletin no 109 “written loan commitments recorded at fair value through earnings” 

  contractual obligations 

our fixed noncancelable obligations as of december 31 2008 were as follows

  critical accounting policies 

  general 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods we continually evaluate the estimates we use to prepare the consolidated financial statements and update those estimates as necessary in general our estimates are based on historical experience on information from third party professionals and other various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances actual results could differ materially from those estimates made by management 

  variable interest entities 

revised financial interpretation no 46 “fin 46r” “consolidation of variable interest entities  requires the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity to consolidate that entity in its financial statements the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is the party that absorbs a majority of the variable interest entity’s expected losses receives a majority of the entity’s expected residual returns or both as a result of ownership contractual or other financial interests in the entity expected losses are the expected negative variability in the fair value of an entity’s net assets exclusive of its variable interests and expected residual returns are the expected positive variability in the fair value of an entity’s net assets exclusive of its variable interests 

forward contracts such as the fixed price purchase agreements utilized by us to acquire finished lot inventory are deemed to be variable interests under fin 46r therefore the development entities with which we enter fixed price purchase agreements are examined under fin 46r for possible consolidation by us including certain joint venture limited liability corporations “llc’s” utilized by us to acquire finished lots on a limited basis we have developed a methodology to determine whether we or conversely the owners of the applicable development entity are the primary beneficiary of a development entity the methodology used to evaluate our primary beneficiary status requires substantial management judgment and estimates these judgments and estimates involve assigning probabilities to various estimated cash flow possibilities relative to the development entity’s expected profits and losses and the cash flows associated with changes in the fair value of finished lots under contract although we believe that our accounting policy is designed to properly assess our primary beneficiary status relative to our involvement with the development entities from which we acquire finished lots changes to the probabilities and the cash flow possibilities used in our evaluation could produce widely different conclusions regarding whether we are or are not a development entity’s primary beneficiary possibly resulting in additional or fewer development entities being consolidated on our financial statements see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

  homebuilding inventory 

the carrying value of inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market value cost of lots and completed and uncompleted housing units represent the accumulated actual cost of the units field construction supervisors’ salaries and related direct overhead expenses are included in inventory costs interest costs are not capitalized into inventory upon settlement the cost of the unit is expensed on a specific identification basis cost of manufacturing materials is determined on a firstin firstout basis recoverability and impairment if any is primarily evaluated by analyzing sales of comparable assets we believe that our accounting policy is designed to properly assess the carrying value of homebuilding inventory 

    contract land deposits 

we purchase finished lots under fixed price purchase agreements that require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the contract the deposits are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percentage of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots we maintain an allowance for losses on contract land deposits that we believe is sufficient to provide for losses in the existing contract land deposit portfolio the allowance reflects our judgment of the present loss exposure at the end of the reporting period considering market and economic conditions sales absorption and profitability within specific communities and terms of the various contracts although we consider the allowance for losses on contract land deposits reflected on the december 31 2008 balance sheet to be adequate see note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements there can be no assurance that this allowance will prove to be adequate over time to cover losses due to unanticipated adverse changes in the economy or other events adversely affecting specific markets or the homebuilding industry 

  intangible assets 

reorganization value in excess of identifiable assets “excess reorganization value” goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are not subject to amortization under sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” “sfas 142” rather excess reorganization value goodwill and other intangible assets are subject to an impairment assessment on an annual basis or more frequently if changes in events or circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred we completed our annual assessment of impairment during the first quarter of 2008 and noted no impairment of our goodwill indefinite life intangible asset or excess reorganization value at that time however due to the continued deterioration of the homebuilding market throughout 2008 and the significant impact on the homebuilding market of the credit crisis in the fourth quarter of 2008 we reassessed goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets for impairment in the fourth quarter of 2008 the assessment for goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets is based on the comparison of the net asset value to the fair value of the business unit to which goodwill andor indefinite life intangible assets have been allocated the fair value of the business unit is determined based on estimates made by management as to the discounted future cash flows of the respective business unit as a result of the assessment we determined that both the goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets related to our rymarc homes and fox ridge homes acquisitions were fully impaired these balances were written off in their entirety as of december 31 2008 these conclusions are based on management’s judgment considering such factors as our history of operating success our brand names the positions held in all of the markets in which we operate and our expected future cash flows however changes in strategy or continued adverse changes in market conditions could impact this judgment and require an impairment loss to be recognized if the amount that the carrying value of excess reorganization value exceeds the fair value 

  warranty  product liability accruals 

warranty and product liability accruals are established to provide for estimated future costs as a result of construction and product defects product recalls and litigation incidental to our business liability estimates are determined based on our judgment considering such factors as historical experience the likely current cost of corrective action manufacturers’ and subcontractors’ participation in sharing the cost of corrective action consultations with third party experts such as engineers and evaluations by our general counsel and outside counsel retained to handle specific product liability cases although we consider the warranty and product liability accrual reflected on the december 31 2008 balance sheet see note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements to be adequate there can be no assurance that this accrual will prove to be adequate over time to cover losses due to increased costs for material and labor the inability or refusal of manufacturers or subcontractors to financially participate in corrective action unanticipated adverse legal settlements or other unanticipated changes to the assumptions used to estimate the warranty and product liability accrual 

    stock option expense 

sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” sfas no 123r” requires us to recognize within our income statement compensation costs related to our stock based compensation plans the costs recognized are based on the grant date fair value compensation cost for option grants is recognized on a straightline basis over the requisite service period for the entire award from the date of grant through the period of the last separately vesting portion of the grant 

we calculate the fair value of our nonpublicly traded employee stock options using the blackscholes optionpricing model while the blackscholes model is a widely accepted method to calculate the fair value of options its results are dependent on input variables two of which expected term and expected volatility are significantly dependent on management’s judgment we have concluded that our historical exercise experience is the best estimate of future exercise patterns to determine an option’s expected term to estimate expected volatility we analyze the historical volatility of our common stock changes in management’s judgment of the expected term and the expected volatility could have a material effect on the grantdate fair value calculated and expensed within the income statement in addition we are required to estimate future option forfeitures when considering the amount of stockbased compensation costs to record we have concluded that our historical forfeiture rate is the best measure to estimate future forfeitures of granted stock options however there can be no assurance that our future forfeiture rate will not be materially higher or lower than our historical forfeiture rate which would affect the aggregate cumulative compensation expense recognized 

although we believe that the compensation costs recognized during the year ended december 31 2008 are representative of the cumulative ratable amortization of the grantdate fair value of unvested options outstanding and expected to be exercised changes to the estimated input values such as expected term and expected volatility could produce widely different fair values see notes 1 and 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information on our adoption of sfas no 123r 

impact of inflation changing prices and economic conditions 

see risk factors included in item 1a herein 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates our market risk arises from interest rate risk inherent in our financial instruments interest rate risk results from the possibility that changes in interest rates will cause unfavorable changes in net income or in the value of interest ratesensitive assets liabilities and commitments lower interest rates tend to increase demand for mortgage loans for home purchasers while higher interest rates make it more difficult for potential borrowers to purchase residential properties and to qualify for mortgage loans we have no market rate sensitive instruments held for speculative or trading purposes 

our mortgage banking segment is exposed to interest rate risk as it relates to its lending activities the mortgage banking segment originates mortgage loans which are either sold through optional or mandatory forward delivery contracts into the secondary markets all of the mortgage banking segment’s loan portfolio is held for sale and subject to forward sale commitments nvrm also sells all of its mortgage servicing rights on a servicing released basis 

our homebuilding segment generates operating liquidity and acquires capital assets through fixedrate and variablerate debt the homebuilding segment’s primary debt is a variablerate working capital revolving credit facility that currently provides for unsecured borrowings up to 600000 subject to certain borrowing base limitations the facility expires in december 2010 and outstanding amounts bear interest at either i the prime rate or ii libor plus applicable margin as defined within the facility there were no borrowings under the facility during 2008 

  nvrm generates operating liquidity primarily through the mortgage repurchase agreement which had a borrowing limit of 110000 at december 31 2008 the mortgage repurchase agreement is used to fund nvrm’s mortgage origination activities the pricing rate under the mortgage repurchase agreement is either i libor plus 155 or ii libor plus 020 depending on whether nvrm provides compensating balances the weightedaverage pricing rate for amounts outstanding under the repurchase agreement was 29 during 2008 the average pricing rate for amounts outstanding at december 31 2008 was 19 

the following table represents the contractual balances of our onbalance sheet financial instruments at the expected maturity dates as well as the fair values of those onbalance sheet financial instruments at december 31 2008 the expected maturity categories take into consideration the actual and anticipated amortization of principal and do not take into consideration the reinvestment of cash or the refinancing of existing indebtedness because we sell all of the mortgage loans we originate into the secondary markets we have made the assumption that the portfolio of mortgage loans held for sale will mature in the first year consequently outstanding warehouse borrowings are also assumed to mature in the first year

 item 1 business 

general 

nvr inc “nvr” was formed in 1980 as nvhomes inc our primary business is the construction and sale of singlefamily detached homes townhomes and condominium buildings to fully serve our homebuilding customers we also operate a mortgage banking business we conduct our homebuilding activities directly except for rymarc homes which is operated as a wholly owned subsidiary our mortgage banking operations are operated primarily through a wholly owned subsidiary nvr mortgage finance inc “nvrm” unless the context otherwise requires references to “nvr” “we” “us” or “our” include nvr and its consolidated subsidiaries 

we are one of the largest homebuilders in the united states while we operate in multiple locations in twelve states primarily in the eastern part of the united states approximately 36 of our home settlements in 2007 occurred in the washington dc and baltimore md metropolitan areas which accounted for 49 of our 2007 homebuilding revenues our homebuilding operations include the construction and sale of singlefamily detached homes townhomes and condominium buildings under four trade names ryan homes nvhomes fox ridge homes and rymarc homes the ryan homes fox ridge homes and rymarc homes products are marketed primarily to firsttime homeowners and firsttime moveup buyers the ryan homes product is currently sold in twenty metropolitan areas located in maryland virginia west virginia pennsylvania new york north carolina south carolina ohio new jersey delaware and kentucky during 2007 ryan homes exited the detroit michigan market the fox ridge homes product is sold solely in the nashville tn metropolitan area and the rymarc homes product is sold solely in the columbia south carolina market the nvhomes product is marketed primarily to moveup and upscale buyers and is sold in the washington dc baltimore md philadelphia pa and the maryland eastern shore metropolitan areas in 2007 our average price of a settled unit was approximately 373000 

we do not engage in the land development business instead we acquire finished building lots at market prices from various development entities under fixed price purchase agreements “purchase agreements” that require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the purchase agreement the deposits required under the purchase agreements are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percentage typically ranging up to 10 of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots 

our lot acquisition strategy reduces the financial requirements and risks associated with direct land ownership and land development we may at our option choose for any reason and at any time not to perform under these purchase agreements by delivering notice of our intent not to acquire the finished lots under contract our sole legal obligation and economic loss for failure to perform under these purchase agreements is limited to the amount of the deposit pursuant to the liquidating damage provision contained within the purchase agreements we do not have any financial guarantees or completion obligations and we do not guarantee lot purchases on a specific performance basis under these purchase agreements we generally seek to maintain control over a supply of lots believed to be suitable to meet our fiveyear business plan 

on a very limited basis we also obtain finished lots using joint venture limited liability corporations “llc’s” all llc’s are structured such that we are a noncontrolling member and are at risk only for the amount we have invested we are not a borrower guarantor or obligor on any of the llc’s debt we enter into a standard fixed price purchase agreement to purchase lots from these llc’s at december 31 2007 we had an aggregate investment totaling approximately 13 million in twelve separate llc’s which controlled approximately 700 lots 

  in addition to building and selling homes we provide a number of mortgagerelated services through our mortgage banking operations through operations in each of our homebuilding markets nvrm originates mortgage loans almost exclusively for our homebuyers nvrm generates revenues primarily from origination fees gains on sales of loans and title fees nvrm sells all of the mortgage loans it closes into the secondary markets on a servicing released basis 

segment information for our homebuilding and mortgage banking businesses is included in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

current business environment 

market conditions within the homebuilding industry continued to deteriorate throughout 2007 the slowdown which began in the second half of 2005 has been driven by declining consumer confidence affordability issues and reduced demand for new homes additionally instability within the credit markets in 2007 has placed additional pressures on affordability and demand for new homes as demand for new homes has slowed the industry has been faced with higher levels of new and existing home inventories each of these market factors has resulted in an extremely competitive sales environment and has forced us and our competitors to reduce prices and offer sales incentives in turn our home sales and profit margins have been negatively impacted from prior years we expect the current challenging market conditions to continue in 2008 for additional information and analysis of recent trends in our operations and financial condition see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 of this form 10k 

homebuilding 

  products 

we offer singlefamily detached homes townhomes and condominium buildings with many different basic home designs these home designs have a variety of elevations and numerous other options our homes combine traditional or colonial exterior designs with contemporary interior designs and amenities generally include two to four bedrooms and range from approximately 900 to 7300 square feet during 2007 the prices of our homes settled ranged from approximately 60000 to 2500000 and averaged approximately 373000 during 2006 our average price was approximately 398000 

  markets 

our four reportable homebuilding segments operate in the following geographic regions 

 

further discussion of settlements new orders and backlog activity by homebuilding reportable segment for each of the last three years can be found in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations see item 7 of this report 

  backlog 

backlog totaled 5145 units and approximately 19 billion at december 31 2007 compared to backlog of 6388 units and approximately 26 billion at december 31 2006 our cancellation rate was approximately 21 during 2007 during 2006 and 2005 our cancellation rates were approximately 19 and 12 respectively we can provide no assurance that our historical cancellation rate is indicative of the actual cancellation rate that may occur in 2008 and our cancellation rate could continue to increase see “risk factors” in item 1a 

    construction 

we utilize independent subcontractors under fixed price contracts to perform construction work on our homes the subcontractors’ work is performed under the supervision of our employees who monitor quality control we use many independent subcontractors in our various markets and we are not dependent on any single subcontractor or on a small number of subcontractors 

  land development 

we are not in the land development business we purchase finished lots from various land developers under fixed price purchase agreements that require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the agreement the deposits required under the purchase agreements are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percentage typically ranging up to 10 of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots we are not dependent on any single developer or on a small number of developers 

  sales and marketing 

our preferred marketing method is for customers to visit a furnished model home featuring many builtin options and a landscaped lot the garages of these model homes are usually converted into temporary sales centers where alternative facades and floor plans are displayed and designs for other models are available for review sales representatives are compensated predominantly on a commission basis 

  regulation 

we and our subcontractors must comply with various federal state and local zoning building environmental advertising and consumer credit statutes rules and regulations as well as other regulations and requirements in connection with our construction and sales activities all of these regulations have increased the cost to produce and market our products and in some instances have delayed our developers’ abilities to deliver us finished lots counties and cities in which we build homes have at times declared moratoriums on the issuance of building permits and imposed other restrictions in the areas in which sewage treatment facilities and other public facilities do not reach minimum standards to date restrictive zoning laws and the imposition of moratoriums have not had a material adverse effect on our construction activities however in certain markets in which we operate we believe that our growth has been hampered by the longer time periods necessary for our developers to obtain the necessary governmental approvals 

  competition and market factors 

the housing industry is highly competitive we compete with numerous homebuilders of varying size ranging from local to national in scope some of which have greater financial resources than we do we also face competition from the home resale market our homebuilding operations compete primarily on the basis of price location design quality service and reputation we historically have been one of the market leaders in each of the markets where we build homes 

the housing industry is cyclical and is affected by consumer confidence levels prevailing economic conditions and interest rates other factors that affect the housing industry and the demand for new homes include the availability and the cost of land labor and materials changes in consumer preferences demographic trends and the availability of mortgage finance programs see “risk factors” in item 1a 

we are dependent upon building material suppliers for a continuous flow of raw materials whenever possible we utilize standard products available from multiple sources in the past such raw materials have been generally available to us in adequate supply 

  mortgage banking 

we provide a number of mortgage related services to our homebuilding customers through our mortgage banking operations our mortgage banking operations also include separate subsidiaries that broker title insurance and perform title searches in connection with mortgage loan closings for which they receive commissions and fees because nvrm originates mortgage loans almost exclusively for our homebuilding customers nvrm is dependent on our homebuilding segment in 2007 nvrm closed approximately 10600 loans with an aggregate principal amount of approximately 32 billion as compared to 12200 loans with an aggregate principal amount of approximately 39 billion in 2006 

nvrm sells all of the mortgage loans it closes to investors in the secondary markets on a servicing released basis typically within 30 days from the loan closing nvrm is an approved sellerservicer for fnma gnma fhlmc va and fha mortgage loans 

  competition and market factors 

nvrm’s main competition comes from national regional and local mortgage bankers mortgage brokers thrifts and banks in each of these markets nvrm competes primarily on the basis of customer service variety of products offered interest rates offered prices of ancillary services and relative financing availability and costs 

  regulation 

nvrm is an approved sellerservicer of fnma gnma fhlmc fha and va mortgage loans and is subject to all of those agencies’ rules and regulations these rules and regulations restrict certain activities of nvrm nvrm is currently eligible and expects to remain eligible to participate in such programs in addition nvrm is subject to regulation at the state and federal level with respect to specific origination selling and servicing practices 

  pipeline 

nvrm’s mortgage loans in process that have not closed “pipeline” at december 31 2007 and 2006 had an aggregate principal balance of 12 billion and 16 billion respectively our cancellation rate was approximately 45 in 2007 during 2006 and 2005 our cancellation rates were approximately 35 and 27 respectively we can provide no assurance that the prior year cancellation rate is indicative of the actual cancellation rate that may occur in 2008 and our cancellation rate could continue to increase see “risk factors” in item 1a 

employees 

at december 31 2007 we employed 4119 fulltime persons of whom 1538 were officers and management personnel 279 were technical and construction personnel 818 were sales personnel 640 were administrative personnel and 844 were engaged in various other service and labor activities none of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement and we have never experienced a work stoppage we believe that our employee relations are good

  risk factors 

our business is affected by the risks generally incident to the residential construction business including but not limited to 

 

all of these risks are discussed in detail below 

the homebuilding industry is experiencing a significant downturn the continuation of this downturn could adversely affect our business and our results of operations 

the homebuilding industry has continued to experience a significant downturn as a result of declining consumer confidence affordability issues and uncertainty as to the stability of home prices as a result we have experienced reduced demand for new homes these market factors have also resulted in pricing pressures and in turn lower gross profit margins in most of our markets a continued downturn in the homebuilding industry could result in a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

interest rate movements inflation and other economic factors can negatively impact our business 

high rates of inflation generally affect the homebuilding industry adversely because of their adverse impact on interest rates high interest rates not only increase the cost of borrowed funds to homebuilders but also have a significant effect on housing demand and on the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective purchasers we are also subject to potential volatility in the price of commodities that impact costs of materials used in our homebuilding business increases in prevailing interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

our financial results also are affected by the risks generally incident to our mortgage banking business including interest rate levels the impact of government regulation on mortgage loan originations and servicing and the need to issue forward commitments to fund and sell mortgage loans our homebuilding customers accounted for almost all of our mortgage banking business in 2007 the volume of our continuing homebuilding operations therefore affects our mortgage banking business 

our mortgage banking business also is affected by interest rate fluctuations we also may experience marketing losses resulting from daily increases in interest rates to the extent we are unable to match interest rates and amounts on loans we have committed to originate with forward commitments from third parties to purchase such loans increases in interest rates may have a material adverse effect on our mortgage banking revenue profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

our operations may also be adversely affected by other economic factors within our markets such as negative changes in employment levels job growth and consumer confidence and availability of mortgage financing one or all of which could result in reduced demand or price depression from current levels such negative trends could have a material adverse effect on homebuilding operations 

  these factors and thus the homebuilding business have at times in the past been cyclical in nature any downturn in the national economy or the local economies of the markets in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations in particular approximately 36 of our home settlements during 2007 occurred in the washington dc and baltimore md metropolitan areas which accounted for 49 of our 2007 homebuilding revenues thus we are dependent to a significant extent on the economy and demand for housing in those areas 

our inability to secure and control an adequate inventory of lots could adversely impact our operations 

the results of our homebuilding operations are dependent upon our continuing ability to control an adequate number of homebuilding lots in desirable locations there can be no assurance that an adequate supply of building lots will continue to be available to us on terms similar to those available in the past or that we will not be required to devote a greater amount of capital to controlling building lots than we have historically an insufficient supply of building lots in one or more of our markets an inability of our developers to deliver finished lots in a timely fashion or our inability to purchase or finance building lots on reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

if the market value of our inventory or controlled lot position declines our profit could decrease 

inventory risk can be substantial for homebuilders the market value of building lots and housing inventories can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing market conditions in addition inventory carrying costs can be significant and can result in losses in a poorly performing project or market we must in the ordinary course of our business continuously seek and make acquisitions of lots for expansion into new markets as well as for replacement and expansion within our current markets which is accomplished by us entering fixed price purchase agreements and paying forfeitable deposits under the purchase agreement to developers for the contractual right to acquire the lots in the event of significant changes in economic or market conditions we may cease further building activities in communities or restructure existing purchase agreements resulting in forfeiture of some or all of any remaining land contract deposit paid to the developer we may also dispose of certain subdivision inventories on a bulk or other basis either action may result in a loss which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

because almost all of our customers require mortgage financing the availability of suitable mortgage financing could impair the affordability of our homes lower demand for our products and limit our ability to fully deliver our backlog 

our business and earnings depend on the ability of our potential customers to obtain mortgages for the purchase of our homes in addition many of our potential customers must sell their existing homes in order to buy a home from us the tightening of credit standards and the availability of suitable mortgage financing could prevent customers from buying our homes and could prevent buyers of our customers’ homes from obtaining mortgages they need to complete that purchase both of which could result in our potential customers inability to buy a home from us if our potential customers or the buyers of our customers’ current homes are not able to obtain suitable financing the result could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

if our ability to sell mortgages to investors is impaired we may be required to fund these commitments ourselves or not be able to originate loans at all 

our mortgage segment sells all of the loans it originates into the secondary market usually within 30 days from the date of closing and has up to 125 million available in an annually renewable warehouse credit facility to fund mortgage closings in the event that disruptions to the secondary markets similar to those which occurred during 2007 continue to tighten or eliminate the available liquidity within the secondary markets for mortgage loans or the underwriting requirements by our secondary market investors continue to become more stringent our ability to sell future mortgages could decline and we could be required among other things to fund our commitments to our buyers with our own financial resources which is limited or require our home buyers to find another source of financing the result of such secondary market disruption could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

  our current indebtedness may impact our future operations and our ability to access necessary financing 

our homebuilding operations are dependent in part on the availability and cost of working capital financing and may be adversely affected by a shortage or an increase in the cost of such financing if we require working capital greater than that provided by our operations and our credit facility we may be required to seek to increase the amount available under the facility or to obtain alternative financing no assurance can be given that additional or replacement financing will be available on terms that are favorable or acceptable if we are at any time unsuccessful in obtaining sufficient capital to fund our planned homebuilding expenditures we may experience a substantial delay in the completion of any homes then under construction any delay could result in cost increases and could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

our existing indebtedness contains financial and other restrictive covenants and any future indebtedness may also contain covenants these covenants include limitations on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness pay cash dividends and make distributions make loans and investments enter into transactions with affiliates effect certain asset sales incur certain liens merge or consolidate with any other person or transfer all or substantially all of our properties and assets substantial losses by us or other action or inaction by us or our subsidiaries could result in the violation of one or more of these covenants which could result in decreased liquidity or a default on our indebtedness thereby having a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

our mortgage banking operations are dependent on the availability cost and other terms of mortgage warehouse financing and may be adversely affected by any shortage or increased cost of such financing no assurance can be given that any additional or replacement financing will be available on terms that are favorable or acceptable our mortgage banking operations are also dependent upon the securitization market for mortgagebacked securities and could be materially adversely affected by any fluctuation or downturn in such market 

government regulations and environmental matters could negatively affect our operations 

we are subject to various local state and federal statutes ordinances rules and regulations concerning zoning building design construction and similar matters including local regulations that impose restrictive zoning and density requirements in order to limit the number of homes that can eventually be built within the boundaries of a particular area we have from time to time been subject to and may also be subject in the future to periodic delays in our homebuilding projects due to building moratoriums in the areas in which we operate changes in regulations that restrict homebuilding activities in one or more of our principal markets could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

we are also subject to a variety of local state and federal statutes ordinances rules and regulations concerning the protection of health and the environment we are subject to a variety of environmental conditions that can affect our business and our homebuilding projects the particular environmental laws that apply to any given homebuilding site vary greatly according to the location and environmental condition of the site and the present and former uses of the site and adjoining properties environmental laws and conditions may result in delays cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs or prohibit or severely restrict homebuilding activity in certain environmentally sensitive regions or areas thereby adversely affecting our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

  we are an approved sellerservicer of fnma gnma fhlmc fha and va mortgage loans and are subject to all of those agencies’ rules and regulations any significant impairment of our eligibility to sellservice these loans could have a material adverse impact on our mortgage operations in addition we are subject to regulation at the state and federal level with respect to specific origination selling and servicing practices adverse changes in governmental regulation may have a negative impact on our mortgage loan origination business 

we face competition in our housing and mortgage banking operations 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive we compete with numerous homebuilders of varying size ranging from local to national in scope some of whom have greater financial resources than we do we face competition 

 

our homebuilding operations compete primarily on the basis of price location design quality service and reputation 

the mortgage banking industry is also competitive our main competition comes from national regional and local mortgage bankers thrifts banks and mortgage brokers in each of these markets our mortgage banking operations compete primarily on the basis of customer service variety of products offered interest rates offered prices of ancillary services and relative financing availability and costs 

there can be no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully in our homebuilding or mortgage banking operations an inability to effectively compete may have an adverse impact on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

a shortage of building materials or labor or increases in materials or labor costs may adversely impact our operations 

the homebuilding business has from time to time experienced building material and labor shortages including shortages in insulation drywall certain carpentry work and concrete as well as fluctuating lumber prices and supply in addition high employment levels and strong construction market conditions could restrict the labor force available to our subcontractors and us in one or more of our markets significant increases in costs resulting from these shortages or delays in construction of homes could have a material adverse effect upon our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

product liability litigation and warranty claims may adversely impact our operations 

construction defect and home warranty claims are common and can represent a substantial risk for the homebuilding industry the cost of insuring against construction defect and product liability claims as well as the claims themselves can be high in addition insurance companies limit coverage offered to protect against these claims further restrictions on coverage available or significant increases in premium costs or claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

changes in tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws may negatively affect our operating results 

the effects of possible changes in the tax laws or changes in their interpretation could have a material negative impact on our operating results 

  weatherrelated and other events beyond our control may adversely impact our operations 

extreme weather or other events such as hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes forest fires floods terrorist attacks or war may affect our markets our operations and our profitability these events may impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or subcontractors causing us material increases in costs or delays in construction of homes which could have a material adverse effect upon our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows

our corporate offices are located in reston virginia where we currently lease approximately 61000 square feet of office space of which approximately 9800 square feet we have subleased to a third party the current corporate office lease expires in april 2015 

in connection with the operation of the homebuilding segment we lease manufacturing facilities in the following six locations thurmont maryland burlington county new jersey farmington new york kings mountain north carolina darlington pennsylvania and portland tennessee these facilities range in size from approximately 40000 square feet to 400000 square feet and combined total approximately 1000000 square feet of manufacturing space all of our manufacturing facilities are leased each of these leases contains various options for extensions of the lease and for the purchase of the facility the portland lease expires in 2009 the thurmont and farmington leases expire in 2014 and the kings mountain and burlington county leases expire in 2023 and 2024 respectively the darlington lease expires in 2025

 item 3 legal proceedings 

on july 18 2007 former employees filed lawsuits against us in the court of common pleas in allegheny county pennsylvania and hamilton county ohio in the superior court in durham county north carolina and in the circuit court in montgomery county maryland and on july 19 2007 in the superior court in new jersey alleging that we incorrectly classified our sales and marketing representatives as being exempt from overtime wages these lawsuits are similar in nature to another lawsuit filed on october 29 2004 by another former employee in the united states district court for the western district of new york the complaints seek injunctive relief an award of unpaid wages including fringe benefits liquidated damages equal to the overtime wages allegedly due and not paid attorney and other fees and interest the suits were filed as purported class actions the class of individuals that any of the lawsuits purport to represent has not been certified we intend to vigorously defend these actions as we believe that our compensation practices in regard to sales and marketing representatives are entirely lawful our position is strongly supported by two letter rulings that the united states department of labor issued in january 2007 in accordance with the dol’s mandate to interpret federal wage and hour laws the two courts to most recently consider similar claims against other homebuilders have adopted the dol’s position that sales and marketing representatives were properly classified as exempt from overtime wages because we are unable to determine the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome of this case or the amount of damages if any we have not recorded any associated liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 

  in 2006 and 2005 we received requests for information pursuant to section 308a of the clean water act the “act” from regions 3 and 4 of the united states environmental protection agency the “epa” the requests sought information regarding our storm water management discharge practices in north carolina pennsylvania maryland and virginia during the homebuilding construction process we have provided the epa with information in response to each of its requests additionally in 2005 the epa notified us of alleged storm water management violations under the act at a homebuilding site in pennsylvania and that we may potentially be subject to administrative fines of up to 157000 for the alleged violations we have completed our building activity at the homebuilding site alleged to be in violation we cannot predict the outcome of the epa’s review of our storm water management practices further it is not known at this time whether the epa will seek to take legal action or impose penalties in connection with the alleged violation at the construction site in pennsylvania thus we have not recorded any associated liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 

on april 16 2007 a lawsuit was filed by one of our customers against us in the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania alleging that we violated section 8 of the real estate settlement and protection act the complaint sought treble damages interest injunctive and declaratory relief attorney fees and other expenses the lawsuit was filed as a purported class action in january 2008 the suit was settled for a nominal amount and dismissed in its entirety 

we are also involved in various other litigation arising in the ordinary course of business in the opinion of management and based on advice of legal counsel this litigation is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations

overview 

business 

our primary business is the construction and sale of singlefamily detached homes townhomes and condominium buildings to fully serve our homebuilding customers we also operate a mortgage banking and title services business we primarily conduct our operations in mature supplyconstrained markets additionally we generally grow our business through market share gains in our existing markets and by expanding into markets contiguous to our current active markets our four homebuilding reportable segments consist of the following regions 

 

we believe we operate our business with a conservative operating strategy we do not engage in land development and primarily construct homes on a presold basis this strategy allows us to maximize inventory turnover which enables us to minimize market risk and to operate with less capital thereby enhancing rates of return on equity and total capital in addition we focus on obtaining and maintaining a leading market position in each market we serve this strategy allows us to gain valuable efficiencies and competitive advantages in our markets which we believe contributes to minimizing the adverse effects of regional economic cycles and provides growth opportunities within these markets 

because we are not active in the land development business our continued success is contingent upon our ability to control an adequate supply of finished lots on which to build and on our developers’ ability to timely deliver finished lots to meet the sales demands of our customers we acquire finished building lots at market prices from various development entities under purchase agreements these purchase agreements require deposits in the form of cash or letters of credit that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the purchase agreement however we believe that this lot acquisition strategy reduces the financial requirements and risks associated with direct land ownership and development as of december 31 2007 we controlled approximately 67600 lots with deposits in cash and letters of credit totaling approximately 329000 and 9000 respectively included in the number of controlled lots are approximately 17100 lots for which we have recorded a contract land deposit impairment reserve of approximately 133700 as of december 31 2007 see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information regarding contract land deposits 

  overview of current business environment 

the current home sales environment remains challenging characterized by an increase in the number of existing and new homes available for sale declining homebuyer confidence affordability issues and a more restrictive mortgage lending environment the mortgage market changed significantly during 2007 due to the turmoil in the credit markets it became more difficult for our customers to obtain mortgage financing especially for customers seeking subprime or jumbo mortgage products in addition some of our markets have been designated as “declining markets” by certain lenders thereby increasing the downpayment required to obtain a mortgage loan this in turn has further reduced affordability market conditions deteriorated throughout 2007 exerting downward pressure on both new orders and on selling prices selling prices in most of our markets have also been negatively impacted as many homebuilders have reduced prices in an effort to reduce new home inventories as a result of these deteriorating market conditions new orders for 2007 were down 7 from the prior year and we experienced an increase in our cancellation rate to 21 in 2007 from 19 in 2006 in addition we experienced an increase in cancellation rates in the fourth quarter of 2007 to 32 from 20 in the fourth quarter of 2006 cancellation rates were the highest in our midatlantic segment where they increased to 25 for the year ended 2007 from 23 in 2006 and for the fourth quarter increased to 37 in 2007 from 25 in the fourth quarter of 2006 additionally prevailing market conditions exerted downward pressure on selling prices and in response we increased incentives to homebuyers and reduced prices in many of our markets these pricing pressures led to a 7 decrease in the average selling price for new orders in 2007 as compared to 2006 average selling prices for the sixmonth period ended december 31 2007 were down 11 from the same period in 2006 average selling prices were down in each of our market segments for the year except for the south east segment where average selling prices increased approximately 10 year over year and were higher by 4 for the sixmonth period ended december 31 2007 as compared to the same period in 2006 

throughout 2007 we have continued to work with our developers to reduce lot purchase prices to current market values andor to defer scheduled lot purchases to coincide with our slower than expected sales pace in communities where we are unsuccessful in negotiating necessary adjustments to the purchase agreements to meet current market prices we may exit the community and forfeit our deposit during 2007 we incurred contract land deposit impairment charges of approximately 261800 from such actual or expected terminations or from restructured purchase agreements where we forfeited the deposit in 2006 contract land deposit impairment charges totaled approximately 173800 as noted above as of december 31 2007 we had a reserve of approximately 133700 on outstanding contract land deposits related to approximately 17100 lots these lots are included in the total number of lots controlled mentioned above the total number of lots controlled at december 31 2007 is down 24 from approximately 88500 lots at december 31 2006 due to the termination of certain purchase agreements and a reduced pace of entering into new lot purchase agreements due to uncertainties within the homebuilding market and its impact on the market value of land 

consolidated revenues for 2007 decreased 16 to 5129342 from 6134124 in 2006 net income for 2007 was 333955 5414 per diluted share compared to net income of 587412 8805 per diluted share a 43 decrease in net income and a 39 decrease in diluted earnings per share gross profit margins within our homebuilding business decreased to 163 in 2007 from 221 in 2006 gross profit margins have been negatively impacted by the aforementioned lower selling prices and increased incentives and continue to trend lower additionally gross profit margins were negatively impacted by the contract land deposit impairment charges in 2007 as discussed above 

as a result of our current year performance and our expectations that the market will remain challenging in 2008 we determined that is was improbable that we would achieve the performance metric related to 410557 outstanding stock options the performance metric requires aggregate diluted earnings per share for the years ended december 31 2005 through december 31 2008 to exceed 33900 per share this determination resulted in the reversal of approximately 31500 of pretax stockbased compensation expense during the third quarter of 2007 which had been recognized in prior reporting periods as follows 28450 in homebuilding general and administrative costs 900 in homebuilding cost of sales and 2150 in mortgage banking general and administrative costs it is expected that none of the outstanding stock options that are subject to the performance metric will vest and it is improbable that future stockbased compensation will be recognized for these options 

based on the current uncertainty in both the homebuilding and mortgage markets we expect to see continued pricing pressures and in turn continued pressure on gross profit margins in future periods to offset these declining selling prices and customer affordability issues we are aggressively working with our vendors to reduce material and labor costs incurred in the construction process in addition to the focus on reducing lot costs as discussed above additionally in many of our markets we are providing house types at lower sales price points by reducing the square footage of the products offered and by providing fewer upgraded features as standard options this provides homebuyers with a more affordable product and the option to upgrade only those features important to each particular buyer in addition we made further staffing reductions in 2007 to size our organization to meet expected sales activity levels for future periods we continue to assess and adjust our staffing levels and organizational structure as conditions warrant 

  homebuilding operations 

the following table summarizes the results of our consolidated homebuilding operations and certain operating activity for each of the last three years 

 

consolidated homebuilding revenues 

homebuilding revenues for 2007 decreased 16 from 2006 primarily as a result of an 11 decrease in the number of homes settled and a 6 decrease in the average settlement price these decreases were driven primarily by a 23 lower number of units in backlog and a 7 lower average price of units in backlog at the beginning of 2007 as compared to the beginning of 2006 

homebuilding revenues for 2006 increased 17 from 2005 primarily as a result of a 10 increase in the number of homes settled and a 6 increase in the average settlement price each of these increases was driven by a higher backlog at the beginning of 2006 as compared to the beginning of 2005 beginning backlog units and dollars were 13 and 26 higher respectively year over year additionally these increases in settlements were experienced year over year in each of our markets 

consolidated homebuilding new orders 

the number of new orders for 2007 and the average selling price of new orders each decreased 7 when compared to 2006 the current challenging market conditions which began to deteriorate in the second half of 2005 have led to an increase in cancellation rates year over year to 21 in 2007 from 19 in 2006 and in turn have negatively impacted new orders in 2007 additionally we noted a significant increase in the cancellation rates in the fourth quarter of 2007 to 32 from 20 in the fourth quarter of 2006 these increases in cancellation rates are driven by continued tightening of mortgage underwriting standards and financing availability which impacts not only our customers’ ability to secure financing for their new home purchase but also has impacted our customers’ ability to sell their existing homes leading to contract cancellations sales were also negatively impacted by a 14 reduction in the average number of active communities in 2007 down to 505 from 589 in 2006 the decrease in the average number of active communities is a result of the termination of certain purchase agreements and a reduced pace of entering into new lot option contracts due to uncertainties within the homebuilding market and its impact on the market value of land 

  the number of new orders for 2006 decreased 10 from 2005 and the value of new orders for 2006 decreased 16 to 4988137 from 5928815 in 2005 the decrease in new orders was attributable to lower sales absorption per community resulting from a more competitive sales environment in 2006 as compared to 2005 the average number of communities open during 2006 exceeded the number open during 2005 by 13 while the average number of communities open during the fourth quarter of 2006 of 551 was down 6 from the same period in 2005 the decrease in the number of active communities in the fourth quarter was attributable to our review of our lot option deposit contracts and the subsequent exiting from certain communities which were no longer profitable 

consolidated homebuilding gross profit 

gross profit margins declined to 163 in 2007 from 221 in 2006 gross profit margins were negatively impacted in 2007 by lower selling prices created by the aforementioned difficult market conditions additionally gross profit margins were negatively impacted by the contract land deposit impairment charges in 2007 of 261800 or 519 basis points as compared to 173800 in 2006 or 288 basis points we expect continued gross profit margin pressure over at least the next several quarters due to the current market conditions as previously discussed in the overview section above 

gross profit margins declined to 221 in 2006 from 278 in 2005 gross profit margins were negatively impacted by lower selling prices contract land deposit impairment charges in 2006 and higher lot and certain commodity costs excluding lumber during 2006 we incurred contract land deposit impairment charges of approximately 173800 these impairments lowered gross profit margins by 288 basis points in 2005 contract land deposit impairment charges totaled approximately 12600 

consolidated homebuilding selling general and administrative “sga” 

sga expenses in 2007 decreased 88799 or 21 from 2006 and as a percentage of revenue decreased to 68 in 2007 from 72 in 2006 the decrease in sga expenses is partially attributable to an approximate 36300 decrease in personnel costs this decrease resulted from a reduction in staffing levels to meet current and expected levels of sales activity and lower incentive compensation costs of approximately 9200 year over year in addition sga costs were favorably impacted by a reduction of approximately 39800 in stockbased compensation costs in 2007 as compared to 2006 as discussed in the overview section above during 2007 we determined that is was improbable that we would achieve the performance metric related to 410557 outstanding stock options this determination resulted in the reversal of approximately 28450 in stockbased compensation in addition because it is expected that none of the outstanding stock options that are subject to the performance metric will vest we did not record any additional compensation costs related to these options in the fourth quarter of 2007 sga costs were also favorably impacted by a reduction in marketing costs of approximately 10000 in 2007 from 2006 due to the aforementioned 14 reduction in the average number of active communities in the current year 

sga expense increased 86794 or 25 year over year and as a percentage of revenue increased to 72 in 2006 from 67 in 2005 the increase in sga expense was primarily attributable to the implementation of sfas 123r in 2006 as a result of which we recognized approximately 53000 in sga compensation costs related to outstanding stock options we incurred no compensation costs for outstanding stock options in 2005 additionally sga costs were higher as a result of an approximate 29500 increase in marketing costs attributable to an increase in the average number of active communities in 2006 as compared to 2005 and to increased marketing efforts required to compete in an increasingly competitive market 

consolidated homebuilding backlog 

the net new order and settlement activity as discussed above resulted in a decrease in backlog units and dollars to 5145 and 1910504 respectively at december 31 2007 compared to 6388 units and 2634720 respectively at december 31 2006 the 27 decrease in backlog dollars was attributable to the 19 decrease in backlog units and an 11 decrease in the average price of new orders for the sixmonth period ended december 31 2007 as compared to the same period in 2006 

  backlog units and dollars were 6388 and 2634720 respectively at december 31 2006 compared to backlog units of 8310 and dollars of 3673221 at december 31 2005 the decrease in backlog units was due primarily to a 17 decrease in the number of new orders for the sixmonth period ended december 31 2006 as compared to the same period ended december 31 2005 coupled with a 10 increase in the number of homes settled in 2006 as compared to 2005 the 28 decrease in backlog dollars was attributable to the 23 decrease in backlog units and a 10 decrease in the average price of new orders for the sixmonth period ended december 31 2006 as compared to the same period in 2005 

reportable homebuilding segments 

homebuilding profit before tax includes all revenues and income generated from the sale of homes less the cost of homes sold sga expenses and a corporate capital allocation charge determined at the corporate headquarters the corporate capital allocation charge eliminates in consolidation is based on the segment’s average net assets employed and is charged using a consistent methodology in the years presented the corporate capital allocation charged to the operating segment allows the chief operating decision maker as defined in statement of financial accounting standards no 131 disclosure about segments of an enterprise and related information  to determine whether the operating segment’s results are providing the desired rate of return after covering our cost of capital we record charges on contract land deposits when we determine that it is probable that recovery of the deposit is impaired for segment reporting purposes impairments on contract land deposits are generally charged to the operating segment upon the determination to terminate a lot purchase agreement with the developer or to restructure a purchase agreement resulting in the forfeiture of the deposit the following tables summarize certain homebuilding operating activity by reportable segment for each of the last three years 

 

   

mid atlantic 

2007 versus 2006 

the mid atlantic segment had an approximate 391900 or 57 decrease in segment profit year over year revenues decreased 19 as a result of an 11 decrease in the number of units settled and a 9 decrease in the average settlement price the decrease in units settled is attributable to a 26 lower backlog unit balance at the beginning of the 2007 as compared to the beginning of 2006 offset partially by a higher backlog turnover rate year over year the decrease in the average settlement price is attributable to an 8 lower average price of homes in beginning backlog year over year the segment’s gross profit margin percentage declined in 2007 to 177 from 256 in 2006 negatively impacted by the 9 decrease in average settlement prices and current market conditions which resulted in the writeoff of approximately 154000 in contract land deposits in 2007 as compared to approximately 126000 in impairment charges in 2006 

segment new orders were down 8 in 2007 from 2006 and the average selling price declined by 9 new orders in the washington dc and baltimore md submarkets declined 12 and 6 respectively these declines were primarily the result of a competitive selling environment driven by a market which continued to deteriorate throughout 2007 this market continues to be confronted by high levels of new and existing home inventories and tighter credit markets as discussed above in the overview section the mortgage market turmoil in 2007 has impacted the availability of jumbo mortgage products which represented approximately 39 of all mortgages closed in the washington dc submarket within this segment these market conditions have put significant downward pressure on selling prices and contributed to higher levels of cancellations within these markets cancellation rates for the mid atlantic segment increased to 25 in 2007 from 23 in 2006 with the highest cancellation rates occurring in the washington dc submarket where the cancellation rates increased to 31 in 2007 from 29 in 2006 additionally cancellation rates in the washington dc submarket increased in the fourth quarter of 2007 to 46 as compared to 34 in the fourth quarter of 2006 the net new order and settlement activity for 2007 resulted in a 26 decrease in backlog units at december 31 2007 as compared to the same period in 2006 backlog dollars decreased 33 year over year due to the decrease in backlog units and additionally to a 12 decrease in the average selling price for new orders for the sixmonth period ended december 31 2007 as compared to the same period in 2006

mid east 

2007 versus 2006 

the mid east segment had an approximate 11100 or 16 increase in segment profit year over year despite a decrease in revenues for the segment of 11 or approximately 105500 the decrease in revenues is attributable to a 7 decrease in units settled year over year and a 4 decrease in the average settlement price the segment’s gross profit margin percentage increased to 181 in 2007 from 166 in 2006 the increase in gross profit margins year over year is attributable to an approximate 8000 favorable variance in operating costs within the segment due primarily to lower personnel costs gross profit margins were negatively impacted in each year by the writeoff of contract land deposits of approximately 10800 and 10000 in 2007 and 2006 respectively segment profit was also favorably impacted by an approximate 7000 decrease in marketing costs due to a 22 reduction in the average number of active communities within the segment in 2007 as compared to 2006 

segment new orders were down 3 year over year and the average selling price for new orders decreased 7 new orders were negatively impacted by the aforementioned decrease in the number of active communities and by deteriorating market conditions throughout 2007 which led to declining new orders in each successive quarter in 2007 the net new order and settlement activity resulted in a 13 decrease in backlog units at december 31 2007 as compared to december 31 2006 backlog dollars were down 21 year over year due to the decrease in backlog units coupled with a 9 decrease in the average price on new orders for the sixmonth period ended december 31 2007 as compared to the same period in 2006

  south east 

2007 versus 2006 

the south east segment had an approximate 9800 or 12 increase in segment profit year over year revenues for the segment increased approximately 68100 or 12 as a result of a 16 increase in the average settlement price offset partially by a 4 decrease in the number of units settled the increase in the average settlement price is attributable to a 20 higher average price of homes in beginning backlog for 2007 as compared to 2006 the higher value of homes in beginning backlog was attributable to favorable market conditions in the prior year which allowed us to increase sales prices as well as a general shift in sales within the segment to a larger higher priced product the number of settlements is down primarily due to the 2007 beginning backlog being 4 lower than backlog at the beginning of 2006 gross profit margin percentage for the segment in 2007 remained flat with 2006 at 220 

segment new orders were down 6 year over year while the average new order price for 2007 increased 10 from 2006 although the south east segment was not as severely impacted by the adverse economic conditions experienced in our other reporting segments during the first half of 2007 the continued tightening in the credit markets and declining consumer confidence has contributed to increased downward pressure on selling prices and higher levels of cancellations within this segment new orders were negatively impacted by a 37 decline in new orders in the fourth quarter of 2007 as compared to the same period in 2006 as market conditions grew more challenging within the south east segment the cancellation rate in the fourth quarter of 2007 increased to 36 compared to 18 in the same period in 2006 in addition the average selling price of new orders in the fourth quarter of 2007 was down 2 from the same period in 2006 we expect these challenging market conditions to continue to put downward pressure on new orders average selling prices and gross profit margin percentages in 2008 the net new order and settlement activity for 2007 resulted in a 12 decrease in backlog units at december 31 2007 as compared to december 31 2006 backlog dollars were down 6 at december 31 2007 as compared the december 31 2006 due to the lower backlog unit balance offset partially by a 4 increase in the average sales price of new orders for the sixmonth period ended december 31 2007 as compared to the same period in 2006

homebuilding segment reconciliations to consolidated homebuilding operations 

in addition to the corporate capital allocation and contract land deposit impairments discussed above the other reconciling items between homebuilding segment profit and homebuilding consolidated profit before tax include unallocated corporate overhead which includes all management incentive compensation stock option compensation expense consolidation adjustments and external corporate interest expense our overhead functions such as accounting treasury human resources land acquisition etc are centrally performed and the costs are not allocated to the company’s operating segments consolidation adjustments consist of such items to convert the reportable segments’ results which are predominantly maintained on a cash basis to a full accrual basis for external financial statement presentation purposes and are not allocated to the company’s operating segments likewise stock option compensation expense is not charged to the operating segments external corporate interest expense is primarily comprised of interest charges on the company’s outstanding senior notes and working capital line borrowings and are not charged to the operating segments because the charges are included in the corporate capital allocation discussed above 

   

 

  

   

 mortgage banking segment 

we conduct our mortgage banking activity through nvr mortgage finance inc “nvrm” a wholly owned subsidiary nvrm focuses almost exclusively on serving the homebuilding segment’s customer base following is a table of financial and statistical data for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 

 

loan closing volume for the year ended december 31 2007 decreased 18 from 2006 the 2007 decrease was primarily attributable to a 5 decrease in the average loan amount and a year over year 13 decrease in the number of units closed the decrease in the average loan amount reflects the aforementioned decrease in the homebuilding segment’s average settlement prices the unit decrease for the year ended december 31 2007 reflects a decrease in the number of settlements by the homebuilding segment and a 1 decrease in the percentage of loans closed for nvr’s homebuyers who obtain a mortgage to purchase the home “capture rate” 

segment profit for the year ended december 31 2007 decreased approximately 14200 from 2006 the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in mortgage banking fees attributable to the aforementioned decrease in closed loan volume and a reduction in fees charged to customers to assist our selling efforts in the homebuilding segment the decrease to mortgage banking fees was partially offset by an approximate 5400 decrease in costs during 2007 related to the contractual repayment of loan sale income to investors for loans that were paid in full within a set number of days following the sale of the loan and an increase in the percentage of fixed rate loans in the product mix traditionally fixed rate mortgages have been more profitable than adjustable rate mortgages in the second half of 2006 with the change in interest rates the rate differential between fixed rate and adjustable rate mortgages narrowed as a result we saw a shift to these more profitable products which remained favorable throughout 2007 

  as noted above due to the continued earnings decline resulting from the deterioration in market conditions and our expectation that market conditions will not improve in the near term the 2007 yeartodate nvrm results were also impacted by the determination that it is improbable that we will achieve the performance metric related to certain outstanding stock options this determination resulted in the reversal of approximately 2150 of pretax stockbased compensation costs recognized in prior periods 

loan closing volume for the year ended december 31 2006 increased 16 from 2005 the 2006 increase was primarily attributable to a 7 increase in the average loan amount and a year over year 8 increase in the number of units closed the increase in the average loan amount reflects the aforementioned increase in the homebuilding segment’s average settlement prices the unit increase for the year ended december 31 2006 reflects an increase in the number of settlements by the homebuilding segment offset slightly by a 1 decrease in nvr’s capture rate 

segment profit for the year ended december 31 2006 increased approximately 11000 from 2005 the increase was primarily due to an increase in mortgage banking fees attributable to the aforementioned increase in closed loan volume and the product mix shift towards fixed rate mortgages the increase to mortgage banking fees was net of an approximate 2600 increase in costs during 2006 related to the contractual repayment of loan sale income to investors for loans that were paid in full within a set number of days following the sale of the loan 

nvrm is dependent on our homebuilding segment’s customers for business as sales and selling prices of the homebuilding segment decline nvrm’s operations will also be adversely affected in many cases nvrm is reducing the fees charged to its borrowers in an effort to assist our selling efforts and is likely to continue doing so in the foreseeable future which will adversely impact the mortgage segment’s future results in addition the mortgage company’s operating results may be adversely affected in future periods due to the tightening credit markets specifically secondary markets for nonconforming loans and loans where buyers put little or no money down on the home have experienced a substantial reduction in the number of investors willing to purchase such products the decrease of secondary liquidity for these products has led to a tightening of credit standards and in turn reduced the number of potential homebuyers and thus the number of potential borrowers for the mortgage segment 

seasonality 

overall we do not experience material seasonal fluctuations in sales settlements or loan closings 

effective tax rate 

our consolidated effective tax rate in 2007 2006 and 2005 was 381 390 and 390 respectively the lower effective tax rate in 2007 is primarily due to the favorable tax impact of the increased deduction for domestic production activities available to the company under internal revenue code section 199 which was established by the american jobs creation act of 2004

  nvr’s mortgage banking segment provides for its mortgage origination and other operating activities using cash generated from operations as well as various shortterm credit facilities nvrm has available an annually renewable mortgage warehouse facility the “revolving credit agreement” with an aggregate borrowing limit of 125000 the revolving credit agreement is used to fund nvrm’s mortgage origination activities under which 83463 was outstanding at december 31 2007 as of december 31 2007 the borrowing base limitation reduced the amount available to us for borrowing to approximately 101000 the revolving credit agreement expires in august 2008 the interest rate under the revolving credit agreement is either i libor plus 10 or ii 1125 depending on whether nvrm provides compensating balances the weighted average interest rate for amounts outstanding under the revolving credit agreement was 45 during 2007 nvrm’s mortgage warehouse facility limits the ability of nvrm to transfer funds to nvr in the form of dividends loans or advances in addition nvrm is required to maintain a minimum net worth of 14000 

on january 20 1998 we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission “sec” for the issuance of up to 400000 of debt securities the “1998 shelf registration” the 1998 shelf registration statement was declared effective on february 27 1998 and provides that securities may be offered from time to time in one or more series and in the form of senior or subordinated debt 

on june 17 2003 we completed an offering at par for 200000 of 5 senior notes due 2010 the “notes” under the 1998 shelf registration the notes mature on june 15 2010 and bear interest at 5 payable semiannually in arrears on june 15 and december 15 commencing on december 15 2003 the notes are general unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness and indebtedness under our working capital credit facility the notes are senior in right of payment to any future subordinated indebtedness that we may incur we may redeem the notes in whole or in part at any time upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days notice at a redemption price equal to the greater of a 100 of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed or b the discounted present value of the remaining scheduled payments of the notes to be redeemed plus in each case accrued and unpaid interest upon completion of the 2003 notes offering we had 55000 remaining available for issuance under the 1998 shelf registration 

on may 27 2004 we filed a shelf registration statement the “2004 shelf registration” with the sec to register up to 1000000 for future offer and sale of debt securities common shares preferred shares depositary shares representing preferred shares and warrants the sec declared the 2004 shelf registration effective on june 15 2004 nvr expects to use the proceeds received from future offerings issued under the 2004 shelf registration and the 1998 shelf registration for general corporate purposes this discussion of our shelf registration capacity does not constitute an offer of any securities for sale 

equity repurchases 

in addition to funding growth in our homebuilding and mortgage banking operations we historically have used a substantial portion of our excess liquidity to repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock in open market and privately negotiated transactions this ongoing repurchase activity is conducted pursuant to publicly announced board authorizations and is typically executed in accordance with the safeharbor provisions of rule 10b18 of the securities and exchange act of 1934 as amended in addition the board resolutions authorizing us to repurchase shares of our common stock specifically prohibit us from purchasing shares from our officers directors profit sharing401k plan trust or employee stock ownership plan trust the repurchase program assists us in accomplishing our primary objective creating increases in shareholder value we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock during the fourth quarter of 2007 for the year ended december 31 2007 we repurchased approximately 785000 shares of our common stock at an aggregate purchase price of 507472 

  cash flows 

as shown in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended december 31 2007 our operating activities provided cash of 558766 cash was provided primarily by homebuilding operations and a reduction in our homebuilding inventories of approximately 45000 due to a reduction in the number of homes under construction at the end of 2007 as compared to the same period in 2006 cash was also provided by an approximate 71000 decrease in mortgage loans held for sale the presentation of operating cash flows was reduced by approximately 69000 which is the amount of the excess tax benefit realized from the exercise of stock options during the period and credited directly to additional paid in capital as required by sfas 123r which we adopted effective january 1 2006 excess tax benefits credited directly to additionalpaidin capital resulting from stockbased compensation must be presented as an operating cash outflow and a financing cash inflow 

net cash used for investing activities was 9315 for the year ended december 31 2007 and was used primarily for property and equipment purchases 

net cash used for financing activities was 441361 for the year ended december 31 2007 during 2007 we repurchased approximately 785000 shares of our common stock at an aggregate purchase price of approximately 507500 under our ongoing common stock repurchase program as discussed in the equity repurchases section above we also reduced net borrowings under the mortgage warehouse facility by approximately 70000 the presentation of financing cash flows was favorably impacted by approximately 68000 of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the realization of approximately 69000 in excess income tax benefits from the exercise of stock options which pursuant to sfas 123r must be reported as a financing cash inflow 

at december 31 2007 the homebuilding segment had restricted cash of 6192 which relates to customer deposits on certain home sales 

we believe that cash generated from operations and borrowings available under our credit facilities and the public debt markets will be sufficient to satisfy near and long term cash requirements for working capital and debt service in both our homebuilding and mortgage banking operations 

off balance sheet arrangements 

lot acquisition strategy 

we do not engage in the land development business instead we acquire finished building lots at market prices from various development entities under fixed price purchase agreements that require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the agreement the deposits required under the purchase agreements are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percentage typically ranging up to 10 of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots 

we believe that our lot acquisition strategy reduces the financial requirements and risks associated with direct land ownership and land development we may at our option choose for any reason and at any time not to perform under these purchase agreements by delivering notice of our intent not to acquire the finished lots under contract our sole legal obligation and economic loss for failure to perform under these purchase agreements is limited to the amount of the deposit pursuant to the liquidating damage provision contained within the purchase agreements we do not have any financial guarantees or completion obligations and we do not guarantee lot purchases on a specific performance basis under these purchase agreements 

  at december 31 2007 we controlled approximately 67600 lots with an aggregate purchase price of approximately 6900000 by making or committing to make deposits of approximately 405000 in the form of cash and letters of credit our entire risk of loss pertaining to the aggregate 6900000 contractual commitment resulting from our nonperformance under the contracts is limited to the 338000 deposit paid plus the additional 67000 deposits referred to below of the 405000 deposit total approximately 329000 in cash and approximately 9000 in letters of credit have been issued as of december 31 2007 and subsequent to december 31 2007 we will pay 67000 in additional deposits assuming that contractual development milestones are met by the developers see contractual obligations section below please refer to note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our lot acquisition strategy in relation to our accounting under fin 46r consolidation of variable interest entities 

bonds and letters of credit 

we enter into bond or letter of credit arrangements with local municipalities government agencies or land developers to collateralize our obligations under various contracts we had 31341 of contingent obligations under such agreements as of december 31 2007 inclusive of the 9000 of lot acquisition deposits in the form of letters of credit discussed above we believe we will fulfill our obligations under the related contracts and do not anticipate any material losses under these bonds or letters of credit 

mortgage commitments and forward sales 

in the normal course of business our mortgage banking segment enters into contractual commitments to extend credit to buyers of singlefamily homes with fixed expiration dates the commitments become effective when the borrowers “lockin” a specified interest rate within time frames established by us all mortgagors are evaluated for credit worthiness prior to the extension of the commitment to mitigate the effect of the interest rate risk inherent in providing rate lock commitments to borrowers we enter into optional or mandatory delivery forward sale contracts to sell whole loans and mortgagebacked securities to brokerdealers the forward sale contracts lock in an interest rate and price for the sale of loans similar to the specific rate lock commitments classified as derivatives both the rate lock commitments to borrowers and the forward sale contracts to brokerdealers are undesignated derivatives and accordingly are marked to market through earnings at december 31 2007 there were contractual commitments to extend credit to borrowers aggregating approximately 144000 and open forward delivery sale contracts aggregating approximately 239000 

contractual obligations 

our fixed noncancelable obligations as of december 31 2007 were as follows 

 

   

 critical accounting policies 

  general 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods we continually evaluate the estimates we use to prepare the consolidated financial statements and update those estimates as necessary in general our estimates are based on historical experience on information from third party professionals and other various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances actual results could differ materially from those estimates made by management 

  variable interest entities 

revised financial interpretation no 46 “fin 46r” consolidation of variable interest entities requires the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity to consolidate that entity in its financial statements the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is the party that absorbs a majority of the variable interest entity’s expected losses receives a majority of the entity’s expected residual returns or both as a result of ownership contractual or other financial interests in the entity expected losses are the expected negative variability in the fair value of an entity’s net assets exclusive of its variable interests and expected residual returns are the expected positive variability in the fair value of an entity’s net assets exclusive of its variable interests 

  forward contracts such as the fixed price purchase agreements utilized by us to acquire finished lot inventory are deemed to be variable interests under fin 46r therefore the development entities with which we enter fixed price purchase agreements are examined under fin 46r for possible consolidation by us including certain joint venture limited liability corporations “llc’s” utilized by us to acquire finished lots on a limited basis we have developed a methodology to determine whether we or conversely the owners of the applicable development entity are the primary beneficiary of a development entity the methodology used to evaluate our primary beneficiary status requires substantial management judgment and estimates these judgments and estimates involve assigning probabilities to various estimated cash flow possibilities relative to the development entity’s expected profits and losses and the cash flows associated with changes in the fair value of finished lots under contract although we believe that our accounting policy is designed to properly assess our primary beneficiary status relative to our involvement with the development entities from which we acquire finished lots changes to the probabilities and the cash flow possibilities used in our evaluation could produce widely different conclusions regarding whether we are or are not a development entity’s primary beneficiary possibly resulting in additional or fewer development entities being consolidated on our financial statements see note 3 to the accompanying financial statements for further information 

  homebuilding inventory 

the carrying value of inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market value cost of lots and completed and uncompleted housing units represent the accumulated actual cost of the units field construction supervisors’ salaries and related direct overhead expenses are included in inventory costs interest costs are not capitalized into inventory upon settlement the cost of the unit is expensed on a specific identification basis cost of manufacturing materials is determined on a firstin firstout basis recoverability and impairment if any is primarily evaluated by analyzing sales of comparable assets we believe that our accounting policy is designed to properly assess the carrying value of homebuilding inventory 

  contract land deposits 

we purchase finished lots under fixed price purchase agreements that require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the contract the deposits are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percentage of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots we maintain an allowance for losses on contract land deposits that we believe is sufficient to provide for losses in the existing contract land deposit portfolio the allowance reflects our judgment of the present loss exposure at the end of the reporting period considering market and economic conditions sales absorption and profitability within specific communities and terms of the various contracts although we consider the allowance for losses on contract land deposits reflected on the december 31 2007 balance sheet to be adequate see note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements there can be no assurance that this allowance will prove to be adequate over time to cover losses due to unanticipated adverse changes in the economy or other events adversely affecting specific markets or the homebuilding industry 

  intangible assets 

reorganization value in excess of identifiable assets “excess reorganization value” goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are not subject to amortization under sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets “sfas 142” rather excess reorganization value goodwill and other intangible assets are subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fairvalue based test we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate that the remaining value of excess reorganization value goodwill and other intangible assets may not be recoverable we completed an assessment of impairment during the first and fourth quarters of 2007 and as of december 31 2007 we believe that excess reorganization value goodwill and other intangible assets were not impaired this conclusion is based on management’s judgment considering such factors as our history of operating success our wellrecognized brand names the significant positions held in the markets in which we operate and our expected future cash flows however changes in strategy or adverse changes in market conditions could impact this judgment and require an impairment loss to be recognized for the amount that the carrying value of excess reorganization value goodwill andor other intangible assets exceeds their fair value 

    warranty  product liability accruals 

warranty and product liability accruals are established to provide for estimated future costs as a result of construction and product defects product recalls and litigation incidental to our business liability estimates are determined based on our judgment considering such factors as historical experience the likely current cost of corrective action manufacturers’ and subcontractors’ participation in sharing the cost of corrective action consultations with third party experts such as engineers and evaluations by our general counsel and outside counsel retained to handle specific product liability cases although we consider the warranty and product liability accrual reflected on the december 31 2007 balance sheet see note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements to be adequate there can be no assurance that this accrual will prove to be adequate over time to cover losses due to increased costs for material and labor the inability or refusal of manufacturers or subcontractors to financially participate in corrective action unanticipated adverse legal settlements or other unanticipated changes to the assumptions used to estimate the warranty and product liability accrual 

  stock option expense 

sfas no 123r sharebased payment  requires us to recognize within our income statement compensation costs related to our stock based compensation plans the costs recognized are based on the grant date fair value compensation cost for “serviceonly” option grants is recognized on a straightline basis over the requisite service period for the entire award from the date of grant through the period of the last separately vesting portion of the grant compensation cost for “performance condition” option grants is recognized on a straightline basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award was in substance multiple awards graded vesting attribution method and if the performance condition is expected to be met 

we calculate the fair value of our nonpublicly traded employee stock options using the blackscholes optionpricing model while the blackscholes model is a widely accepted method to calculate the fair value of options its results are dependent on input variables two of which expected term and expected volatility are significantly dependent on management’s judgment we have concluded that our historical exercise experience is the best estimate of future exercise patterns to determine an option’s expected term to estimate expected volatility we analyze the historical volatility of our common stock changes in management’s judgment of the expected term and the expected volatility could have a material effect on the grantdate fair value calculated and expensed within the income statement in addition we are required to estimate future option forfeitures when considering the amount of stockbased compensation costs to record we have concluded that our historical forfeiture rate is the best measure to estimate future forfeitures of granted stock options however there can be no assurance that our future forfeiture rate will not be materially higher or lower than our historical forfeiture rate which would affect the aggregate cumulative compensation expense recognized 

in addition when recognizing stock based compensation cost related to “performance condition” option grants we are required to make a determination as to whether the performance conditions will be met prior to the completion of the actual performance period the performance metric requires our aggregate diluted earnings per share for the years ended december 31 2005 through december 31 2008 to exceed 33900 per share while we currently believe that this performance condition will not be satisfied our future expected activity levels could cause us to make a different determination resulting in the recognition of all compensation cost related to performance condition option grants that would otherwise have been recognized to date although we believe that the compensation costs recognized during the year ended december 31 2007 are representative of the cumulative ratable amortization of the grantdate fair value of unvested options outstanding and expected to be exercised changes to the estimated input values such as expected term and expected volatility and changes to the determination of whether performance condition grants will vest could produce widely different fair values see notes 1 and 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information on our adoption of sfas 123r 

  impact of inflation changing prices and economic conditions 

see risk factors included in item 1a herein 




 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates our market risk arises from interest rate risk inherent in our financial instruments interest rate risk is the possibility that changes in interest rates will cause unfavorable changes in net income or in the value of interest ratesensitive assets liabilities and commitments lower interest rates tend to increase demand for mortgage loans for home purchasers while higher interest rates make it more difficult for potential borrowers to purchase residential properties and to qualify for mortgage loans we have no market rate sensitive instruments held for speculative or trading purposes 

our mortgage banking segment is exposed to interest rate risk as it relates to its lending activities the mortgage banking segment originates mortgage loans which are either sold through optional or mandatory forward delivery contracts into the secondary markets all of the mortgage banking segment’s loan portfolio is held for sale and subject to forward sale commitments nvrm also sells all of its mortgage servicing rights on a servicing released basis 

our homebuilding segment generates operating liquidity and acquires capital assets through fixedrate and variablerate debt the homebuilding segment’s primary debt is a variablerate working capital revolving credit facility that currently provides for unsecured borrowings up to 600000 subject to certain borrowing base limitations the facility expires in december 2010 and outstanding amounts bear interest at either i the prime rate or ii libor plus applicable margin as defined within the facility there were no borrowings under the facility during 2007 

nvrm generates operating liquidity primarily through the mortgage warehouse facility which had a borrowing limit of 125000 at december 31 2007 the mortgage warehouse facility is used to fund nvrm’s mortgage origination activities the interest rate under the mortgage warehouse facility is either i libor plus 10 or ii 1125 to the extent that nvrm provides compensating balances the weightedaverage interest rate for amounts outstanding under the mortgage warehouse facility was 45 during 2007 

the following table represents the contractual balances of our onbalance sheet financial instruments at the expected maturity dates as well as the fair values of those onbalance sheet financial instruments at december 31 2007 the expected maturity categories take into consideration the actual and anticipated amortization of principal and do not take into consideration the reinvestment of cash or the refinancing of existing indebtedness because we sell all of the mortgage loans we originate into the secondary markets we have made the assumption that the portfolio of mortgage loans held for sale will mature in the first year consequently outstanding warehouse borrowings are also assumed to mature in the first year

 item 1   business tableend 

general 

nvr inc “nvr” was formed in 1980 as nvhomes inc nvr’s primary business is the construction and sale of singlefamily detached homes townhomes and condominium buildings to fully serve our homebuilding customers we also operate a mortgage banking business nvr conducts its homebuilding activities directly except for rymarc homes which is operated as a wholly owned subsidiary and its mortgage banking operations which is operated primarily through a wholly owned subsidiary nvr mortgage finance inc “nvrm” unless the context otherwise requires references to “nvr” “we” “us” or “our” include nvr and its subsidiaries 

we are one of the largest homebuilders in the united states and in the washington dc and baltimore md metropolitan areas while we operate in multiple locations in thirteen states primarily in the eastern part of the united states approximately 38 of our home settlements in 2005 occurred in the washington dc and baltimore md metropolitan areas which accounted for 52 of our 2005 homebuilding revenues our homebuilding operations include the construction and sale of singlefamily detached homes townhomes and condominium buildings under four trade names ryan homes nvhomes fox ridge homes and rymarc homes the ryan homes fox ridge homes and rymarc homes products are moderately priced and marketed primarily to firsttime homeowners and firsttime moveup buyers the ryan homes product is currently sold in twentyone metropolitan areas located in maryland virginia west virginia pennsylvania new york north carolina south carolina ohio new jersey delaware michigan and kentucky the fox ridge homes product is sold solely in the nashville tn metropolitan area and the rymarc homes product is sold solely in the columbia south carolina market the nvhomes product is marketed primarily to moveup and upscale buyers and is sold in the washington dc baltimore md philadelphia pa and the maryland eastern shore metropolitan areas in 2005 our average price of a unit settled was approximately 375000 

we do not engage in the land development business instead we acquire finished building lots at market prices from various development entities under fixed price purchase agreements that require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the agreement the deposits required under the purchase agreements are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percentage typically ranging up to 10 of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots 

our lot acquisition strategy reduces the financial requirements and risks associated with direct land ownership and land development we may at our option choose for any reason and at any time not to perform under these purchase agreements by delivering notice of our intent not to acquire the finished lots under contract our sole legal obligation and economic loss for failure to perform under these purchase agreements is limited to the amount of the deposit pursuant to the liquidating damage provision contained within the purchase agreements we do not have any financial guarantees or completion obligations and with the exception of three specific performance contracts for 80 lots existing at december 31 2005 we do not guarantee specific performance under these purchase agreements we generally seek to maintain control over a supply of lots believed to be suitable to meet our sales objectives for the next 24 to 36 months 

on a very limited basis nvr also obtains finished lots using joint venture limited liability corporations “llc’s” all llc’s are structured such that nvr is a noncontrolling member and is at risk only for the amount invested nvr is not a borrower guarantor or obligor on any of the llc’s debt nvr enters into a standard fixed price purchase agreement to purchase lots from these llc’s at december 31 2005 nvr had an aggregate investment in thirteen separate llc’s totaling approximately 15 million which controlled approximately 1000 lots 

  in addition to building and selling homes we provide a number of mortgagerelated services through our mortgage banking operations through operations in each of our homebuilding markets nvrm originates mortgage loans almost exclusively for our homebuyers nvrm generates revenues primarily from origination fees gains on sales of loans and title fees nvrm sells all of the mortgage loans it closes into the secondary markets on a servicing released basis 

segment information for our homebuilding and mortgage banking businesses is included in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

homebuilding 

  products 

we offer singlefamily detached homes townhomes and condominium buildings with many different basic home designs these home designs have a variety of elevations and numerous other options our homes combine traditional or colonial exterior designs with contemporary interior designs and amenities generally include two to four bedrooms and range from approximately 1000 to 7300 square feet during 2005 the prices of our homes ranged from approximately 90000 to 2000000 

  markets 

our reportable homebuilding segments operate in the following geographic regions 

 

further discussion of settlements new orders and backlog activity by homebuilding reportable segment for each of the last three years can be found in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations see item 7 of this report 

  backlog 

backlog totaled 8310 units and approximately 37 billion at december 31 2005 compared to backlog of 7372 units and approximately 29 billion at december 31 2004 our cancellation rate was approximately 12 during 2005 assuming that our cancellation rate in 2006 is consistent with that experienced in 2005 approximately 88 of the units in backlog at december 31 2005 will settle in 2006 however we can provide no assurance that our historical cancellation rate is indicative of the actual cancellation rate that may occur in 2006 see risk factors in item 1a 

  construction 

we utilize independent subcontractors under fixed price contracts to perform construction work on our homes the subcontractors’ work is performed under the supervision of our employees who monitor quality control we use many independent subcontractors in our various markets and we are not dependent on any single subcontractor or on a small number of subcontractors 

  land development 

we are not in the land development business we purchase finished lots from various land developers under fixed price purchase agreements that require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the agreement the deposits required under the purchase agreements are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percentage typically ranging up to 10 of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots we are not dependent on any single developer or on a small number of developers 

    sales and marketing 

our preferred marketing method is for customers to visit a furnished model home featuring many builtin options and a landscaped lot the garages of these model homes are usually converted into temporary sales centers where alternative facades and floor plans are displayed and designs for other models are available for review sales representatives are compensated predominantly on a commission basis 

  regulation 

nvr and its subcontractors must comply with various federal state and local zoning building environmental advertising and consumer credit statutes rules and regulations as well as other regulations and requirements in connection with our construction and sales activities all of these regulations have increased the cost to produce and market our products and in some instances have delayed our developers’ abilities to deliver us finished lots counties and cities in which we build homes have at times declared moratoriums on the issuance of building permits and imposed other restrictions in the areas in which sewage treatment facilities and other public facilities do not reach minimum standards to date restrictive zoning laws and the imposition of moratoriums have not had a material adverse effect on our construction activities however in certain markets in which we operate we believe that our growth has been hampered by the longer time periods necessary for our developers to move projects through the approval process 

  competition and market factors 

the housing industry is highly competitive we compete with numerous homebuilders of varying size ranging from local to national in scope some of which have greater financial resources than we do we also face competition from the home resale market our homebuilding operations compete primarily on the basis of price location design quality service and reputation we historically have been one of the market leaders in each of the markets where we build homes 

the housing industry is cyclical and is affected by consumer confidence levels prevailing economic conditions and interest rates other factors that affect the housing industry and the demand for new homes include the availability and increases in the cost of land labor and materials changes in consumer preferences demographic trends and the availability of mortgage finance programs 

we are dependent upon building material suppliers for a continuous flow of raw materials whenever possible we utilize standard products available from multiple sources in the past such raw materials have been generally available to us in adequate supply 

mortgage banking 

we provide a number of mortgage related services to our homebuilding customers through our mortgage banking operations our mortgage banking operations also include separate subsidiaries that broker title insurance and perform title searches in connection with mortgage loan closings for which they receive commissions and fees because nvrm originates mortgage loans almost exclusively for our homebuilding customers nvrm is dependent on our homebuilding segment in 2005 nvrm closed approximately 11300 loans with an aggregate principal amount of approximately 34 billion 

nvrm sells all of the mortgage loans it closes to investors in the secondary markets on a servicing released basis typically within 30 days from the loan closing nvrm is an approved sellerservicer for fnma gnma fhlmc va and fha mortgage loans 

    competition and market factors 

nvrm’s main competition comes from national regional and local mortgage bankers mortgage brokers thrifts and banks in each of these markets nvrm competes primarily on the basis of customer service variety of products offered interest rates offered prices of ancillary services and relative financing availability and costs 

  regulation

risk factors 

our business is affected by the risks generally incident to the residential construction business including but not limited to 

 

interest rate movements inflation and other economic factors can negatively impact our business 

high rates of inflation generally affect the homebuilding industry adversely because of their adverse impact on interest rates high interest rates not only increase the cost of borrowed funds to homebuilders but also have a significant effect on housing demand and on the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective purchasers we are also subject to potential volatility in the price of commodities that impact costs of materials used in our homebuilding business increases in prevailing interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations 

our financial results also are affected by the risks generally incident to our mortgage banking business including interest rate levels the impact of government regulation on mortgage loan originations and servicing and the need to issue forward commitments to fund and sell mortgage loans our homebuilding customers accounted for almost all of our mortgage banking business in 2005 the volume of our continuing homebuilding operations therefore affects our mortgage banking business 

  our operations may also be adversely affected by other economic factors within our markets such as negative changes in employment levels job growth and consumer confidence one or all of which could result in reduced demand or price depression from current levels such negative trends could have a material adverse effect on homebuilding operations 

our mortgage banking business also is affected by interest rate fluctuations we also may experience marketing losses resulting from daily increases in interest rates to the extent we are unable to match interest rates and amounts on loans we have committed to originate with forward commitments from third parties to purchase such loans increases in interest rates may have a material adverse effect on our mortgage banking revenue profitability stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations 

these factors and thus the homebuilding business have at times in the past been cyclical in nature any downturn in the national economy or the local economies of the markets in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations in particular approximately 38 of our home settlements during 2005 occurred in the washington dc and baltimore md metropolitan areas which accounted for 52 of our 2005 homebuilding revenues thus we are dependent to a significant extent on the economy and demand for housing in those areas 

our inability to secure and control an adequate inventory of lots could adversely impact our operations 

the results of our homebuilding operations are dependent upon our continuing ability to control an adequate number of homebuilding lots in desirable locations there can be no assurance that an adequate supply of building lots will continue to be available to us on terms similar to those available in the past or that we will not be required to devote a greater amount of capital to controlling building lots than we have historically an insufficient supply of building lots in one or more of our markets an inability of our developers to deliver finished lots in a timely fashion or our inability to purchase or finance building lots on reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations 

if the market value of our inventory declines our profit could decrease 

inventory risk can be substantial for homebuilders the market value of building lots and housing inventories can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing market conditions in addition inventory carrying costs can be significant and can result in losses in a poorly performing project or market we must in the ordinary course of our business continuously seek and make acquisitions of lots for expansion into new markets as well as for replacement and expansion within our current markets in the event of significant changes in economic or market conditions we may dispose of certain subdivision inventories on a bulk or other basis which may result in a loss which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations 

our current indebtedness may impact our future operations and our ability to access necessary financing 

our homebuilding operations are dependent in part on the availability and cost of working capital financing and may be adversely affected by a shortage or an increase in the cost of such financing if we require working capital greater than that provided by our operations and our credit facility we may be required to seek to increase the amount available under the facility or to obtain alternative financing no assurance can be given that additional or replacement financing will be available on terms that are favorable or acceptable if we are at any time unsuccessful in obtaining sufficient capital to fund our planned homebuilding expenditures we may experience a substantial delay in the completion of any homes then under construction any delay could result in cost increases and could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

  our existing indebtedness contains financial and other restrictive covenants and any future indebtedness may also contain covenants these covenants include limitations on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness pay cash dividends and make distributions make loans and investments enter into transactions with affiliates effect certain asset sales incur certain liens merge or consolidate with any other person or transfer all or substantially all of our properties and assets substantial losses by us or other action or inaction by us or our subsidiaries could result in the violation of one or more of these covenants which could result in decreased liquidity or a default on our indebtedness thereby having a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations 

our mortgage banking operations are dependent on the availability cost and other terms of mortgage warehouse financing and may be adversely affected by any shortage or increased cost of such financing no assurance can be given that any additional or replacement financing will be available on terms that are favorable or acceptable our mortgage banking operations are also dependent upon the securitization market for mortgagebacked securities and could be materially adversely affected by any fluctuation or downturn in such market 

government regulations and environmental matters can negatively affect our operations 

we are subject to various local state and federal statutes ordinances rules and regulations concerning zoning building design construction and similar matters including local regulations that impose restrictive zoning and density requirements in order to limit the number of homes that can eventually be built within the boundaries of a particular area we have from time to time been subject to and may also be subject in the future to periodic delays in our homebuilding projects due to building moratoriums in the areas in which we operate changes in regulations that restrict homebuilding activities in one or more of our principal markets could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations 

we are also subject to a variety of local state and federal statutes ordinances rules and regulations concerning the protection of health and the environment we are subject to a variety of environmental conditions that can affect our business and our homebuilding projects the particular environmental laws that apply to any given homebuilding site vary greatly according to the location and environmental condition of the site and the present and former uses of the site and adjoining properties environmental laws and conditions may result in delays cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs or prohibit or severely restrict homebuilding activity in certain environmentally sensitive regions or areas thereby adversely affecting our sales profitability stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations 

we are an approved sellerservicer of fnma gnma fhlmc fha and va mortgage loans and are subject to all of those agencies’ rules and regulations any significant impairment of our eligibility to sellservice these loans could have a material adverse impact on our mortgage operations in addition we are subject to regulation at the state and federal level with respect to specific origination selling and servicing practices adverse changes in governmental regulation may have a negative impact on our mortgage loan origination business 

we face competition in our housing and mortgage banking operations 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive we compete with numerous homebuilders of varying size ranging from local to national in scope some of whom have greater financial resources than we do we face competition 

 

our homebuilding operations compete primarily on the basis of price location design quality service and reputation historically we have been one of the leading homebuilders in each of the markets where we operate 

the mortgage banking industry is also competitive our main competition comes from national regional and local mortgage bankers thrifts banks and mortgage brokers in each of these markets our mortgage banking operations compete primarily on the basis of customer service variety of products offered interest rates offered prices of ancillary services and relative financing availability and costs 

  there can be no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully in our homebuilding or mortgage banking operations an inability to effectively compete may have an adverse impact on our sales profitability stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations 

a shortage of building materials or labor may adversely impact our operations 

the homebuilding business has from time to time experienced building material and labor shortages including shortages in insulation drywall certain carpentry work and concrete as well as fluctuating lumber prices and supply in addition high employment levels and strong construction market conditions could restrict the labor force available to our subcontractors and us in one or more of our markets significant increases in costs resulting from these shortages or delays in construction of homes could have a material adverse effect upon our sales profitability stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations 

product liability litigation and warranty claims may adversely impact our operations 

construction defect and home warranty claims are common and can represent a substantial risk for the homebuilding industry the cost of insuring against construction defect and product liability claims as well as the claims themselves can be high in addition insurance companies limit coverage offered to protect against these claims further restrictions on coverage available or significant increases in premium costs or claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

weatherrelated and other events beyond our control may adversely impact our operations 

extreme weather or other events such as hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes forest fires floods terrorist attacks or war may affect our markets our operations and our profitability these events may impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or subcontractors causing us material increases in costs or delays in construction of homes which could have a material adverse effect upon our sales profitability stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations

results of operations for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 

overview 

our primary business is the construction and sale of singlefamily detached homes townhomes and condominium buildings to fully serve our homebuilding customers we also operate a mortgage banking and title services business we primarily conduct our operations in mature supplyconstrained markets additionally we generally grow our business through market share gains in our existing markets and by expanding into markets contiguous to our current active markets our homebuilding reportable segments consist of the following regions 

 

we believe we operate our business with a conservative operating strategy we do not engage in land development and primarily construct homes on a presold basis this strategy allows us to maximize inventory turnover which enables us to minimize market risk and to operate with less capital thereby enhancing rates of return on equity and total capital in addition we focus on obtaining and maintaining a leading market position in each market we serve this strategy allows us to gain valuable efficiencies and competitive advantages in our markets which we believe contributes to minimizing the adverse effects of regional economic cycles and provides growth opportunities within these markets 

because we are not active in the land development business our continued success is contingent upon our ability to control an adequate supply of finished lots on which to build and on our developers’ ability to timely deliver finished lots to meet the sales demands of our customers timely delivery of lots by our developers can be influenced by many factors such as the developer’s execution of improvements weatherrelated impacts and the length of time necessary to obtain governmental approval of projects we have been impacted in the past year and may be negatively impacted in the future by development delays 

we acquire finished building lots at market prices from various development entities under fixed price purchase agreements “purchase agreements” these purchase agreements require deposits in the form of cash or letters of credit that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the purchase agreement however we believe that this lot acquisition strategy reduces the financial requirements and risks associated with direct land ownership and development as of december 31 2005 we controlled approximately 105000 lots with deposits in cash and letters of credit totaling approximately 600000 and 17000 respectively we also controlled approximately 1000 lots through investments in joint venture limited liability corporations 

consolidated revenues and net income for 2005 increased 22 and 33 respectively from 2004 the increase in net income coupled with our continuing share repurchase program resulted in a 35 increase in diluted earnings per share in 2005 compared to 2004 the increase in consolidated revenues was primarily driven by our homebuilding business where we experienced an 8 increase in the number of homes settled and a 13 increase in the average settlement price in 2005 from 2004 in addition the value of homes in backlog at december 31 2005 exceeded the december 31 2004 backlog value by 26 

homebuilding operations 

the following table summarizes the results of operations and certain operating activity for each of the last three years for our consolidated homebuilding operation 

   

consolidated homebuilding revenues 

homebuilding revenues for 2005 increased 22 from 2004 primarily as a result of a 13 increase in the average settlement price and an 8 increase in the number of homes settled each of these increases was driven by a stronger backlog both in value and units at the beginning of 2005 as compared to the beginning of 2004 due to the company’s overall growth and our ability to raise prices year over year during a period of strong housing demand we experienced increased home settlements year over year in each of our regions except baltimore baltimore md metropolitan area and adjacent counties in pennsylvania where settlements declined slightly from the prior year settlements in the baltimore region were negatively affected by development delays throughout the first three quarters of 2005 the baltimore region was able to resolve several of these development delays in the fourth quarter and settlements for this region increased 24 in the fourth quarter of 2005 as compared to the same period in 2004 

homebuilding revenues for 2004 increased 18 from 2003 primarily as a result of a 12 increase in the average settlement price to 3322 in 2004 from 2979 in 2003 and an increase of 6 in the number of homes settled to 12749 in 2004 from 12050 in 2003 the increase in average settlement prices was primarily attributable to a 9 higher average price of homes in backlog entering 2004 as compared to 2003 and to a 16 increase in the average price of homes sold during the first six months of 2004 as compared to the same period in 2003 the increase in the number of homes settled was primarily attributable to an 8 higher backlog at the beginning of 2004 as compared to the beginning of 2003 

consolidated homebuilding new orders 

the number of new orders for 2005 increased 11 from 2004 and the value of new orders for 2005 increased 23 to 5928815 from 4817780 in 2004 the increase in the number of new orders was primarily attributable to an overall increase in the average number of active communities to 522 in 2005 as compared to 450 in 2004 strong new order growth was experienced in each of our regions except the washington washington dc metropolitan area and adjacent counties in maryland virginia and west virginia region which remained relatively flat with the prior year sales in the washington region were negatively impacted by lower sales absorption during the second half of the year as compared to the same period in 2004 as a result of generally weaker market conditions within the region the 23 increase in the value of new orders was attributable to both the aforementioned increase in the number of new orders and sustained housing demand year over year which provided us the opportunity to raise selling prices resulting in an 11 increase in the average selling price in 2005 as compared to 2004 

the number of new orders for 2004 increased 5 from 2003 while the value of new orders for 2004 increased 22 to 4817780 from 3950413 in 2003 the increase in the number of new orders was attributable to an overall increase in the average number of active communities to 450 in 2004 as compared to 433 in 2003 each of our segments experienced increases year over year in new orders the mid atlantic increase was affected by a 9 decrease in new orders for the baltimore region this decrease resulted primarily from a 7 decrease in the average number of active communities in the baltimore region year over year attributable primarily to development delays the 22 increase in the value of new orders was primarily attributable to the aforementioned increase in the number of new orders and strong housing demand which provided us the opportunity to raise selling prices resulting in a 16 increase in the average selling price in 2004 as compared to 2003 

  consolidated homebuilding gross profit 

the increase in gross profit margins of 210 basis points 21 in 2005 from 2004 was primarily attributable to the aforementioned increases in average settlement prices year over year these increases were partially offset by higher land and building commodity prices in 2005 as compared to 2004 many of the end product building supplies used in our construction operations are impacted by higher more volatile energy and petroleum costs including osb sheathing siding material pvc piping paint asphalt shingles cement gypsum steel glass and insulation we are actively engaged in managing these cost increases to minimize their potential margin impact however gross margins in future periods may be adversely impacted by these higher costs as well as expected pricing pressures in 2006 in many of our markets 

gross profit margins for 2004 increased to 257 compared to 247 for 2003 the increase in profit margins was attributable to the favorable market conditions allowing us to increase sales prices in a majority of the markets leading to the aforementioned 12 increase in average settlement prices in 2004 as compared to 2003 these increases were partially offset by higher land lumber and other commodity prices in 2004 as compared to 2003 

consolidated homebuilding selling general and administrative “sga” 

sga for 2005 increased 84630 or 32 from 2004 and as a percentage of revenues increased to 67 in 2005 from 61 in 2004 the increase in sga costs was primarily attributable to increases in personnel costs and selling and marketing costs of approximately 43400 and 26500 respectively personnel costs have increased primarily as a result of increased wages and management incentive compensation due to increased staffing levels to support our growth strategy as of december 31 2005 sga staffing levels had increased approximately 23 from december 31 2004 the increase in selling and marketing costs were attributable to an increase in advertising and selling support costs due to the aforementioned increase in the average number of active communities year over year sga costs in 2006 will be negatively impacted as a result of the implementation of statement of financial accounting standards no 123r sharebased payment  “sfas 123r” from which we expect to record after tax expense of approximately 36000 for the year based on unvested stock options outstanding at december 31 2005 see recent accounting pronouncements section which follows within item 7 for further discussion 

sga for 2004 increased 12 from 2003 but as a percentage of revenues decreased to 61 in 2004 from 64 in 2003 the increase in sga costs was primarily attributable to increased personnel costs and selling and marketing costs of approximately 11500 and 10400 respectively due to our continued growth 

consolidated homebuilding backlog 

backlog units and dollars were 8310 and 3673221 respectively at december 31 2005 compared to backlog units of 7372 and dollars of 2906041 at december 31 2004 the increase in backlog units was due primarily to a 10 increase in the number of new orders for the sixmonth period ended december 31 2005 as compared to the same period ended december 31 2004 the 26 increase in backlog dollars was attributable to the 13 increase in backlog units and a 7 increase in the average price of new orders for the sixmonth period ended december 31 2005 as compared to the same period in 2004 

backlog units and dollars were 7372 and 2906041 respectively at december 31 2004 compared to backlog units of 6890 and dollars of 2323703 at december 31 2003 the increase in backlog units was due primarily to a 6 increase in the number of new orders for the sixmonth period ended december 31 2004 as compared to the same period ended december 31 2003 the 25 increase in backlog dollars was attributable to the 7 increase in backlog units and a 16 increase in the average price of new orders for the sixmonth period ended december 31 2004 as compared to the same period in 2003 

  reportable segments 

homebuilding profit before tax includes all revenues and income generated from the sale of homes less the cost of homes sold selling general and administrative expenses and a corporate capital allocation charge determined at the corporate headquarters the corporate capital allocation charge eliminates in consolidation is based on the segment’s average net assets employed and is charged using a consistent methodology in the years presented the corporate capital allocation charged to the operating segment allows the chief operating decision maker to determine whether the operating segment’s results are providing the desired rate of return after covering the company’s cost of capital we record charges on contract land deposits when we determine that it is probable that recovery of the deposit is impaired for segment reporting purposes impairments on contract land deposits are charged to the operating segment upon the determination to terminate a finished lot purchase agreement with the developer 

the following tables summarize homebuilding settlements new orders backlog and operating activity by reportable segment for each of the last three years 

   

  mid atlantic 

2005 versus 2004 

the mid atlantic segment had an approximate 240000 increase in segment profit year over year revenues increased 23 as a result of a 4 increase in the number of units settled and an 18 increase in the average settlement price we experienced increased home settlements year over year in each of our regions except baltimore where settlements declined slightly from the prior year settlements in the baltimore region were negatively affected by development delays throughout the first three quarters of 2005 the baltimore region was able to resolve several of these development delays in the fourth quarter and settlements for this region increased 24 in the fourth quarter of 2005 as compared to the same period in 2004 the segment’s gross profit margin percentage grew to 339 in 2005 from 303 in 2004 the gross profit margin increase was due to favorable market conditions generated from strong housing demand within the segment’s markets during the current year which began to level off in the second half of 2006 particularly in the washington dc market segment profits were also negatively affected by an approximate 34000 increase in selling general and administrative costs due to a 24 increase in the number of communities open for sale during 2005 as compared to 2004 and higher wage and other costs to support our growth strategy backlog units and dollars were 14 and 31 higher respectively than the 2004 year principally due to the comparative increases in new orders of 9 and average selling price of 15 

2004 versus 2003 

the mid atlantic segment had an approximate 139000 increase in segment profit year over year revenues increased 20 as a result of a 7 increase in the number of units settled and a 13 increase in average settlement prices the segment’s gross profit margin percentage grew to 303 in 2004 from 286 in 2003 the increase in gross profit margins was attributable to the favorable market conditions mentioned above that allowed us to increase sales prices in a majority of the segment’s markets segment profits were negatively affected by an approximate 17000 increase in selling general and administrative costs due to a 5 increase in the number of communities open for sale during 2004 as compared to 2003 and higher wage and other costs to support our growth strategy 

north east 

2005 versus 2004 

the north east segment had an approximate 3000 increase in segment profit year over year revenues increased 15 primarily as a result of a 14 increase in the average settlement price the segment’s gross profit margin percentage was essentially flat at 214 in 2005 from 211 in 2004 segment profits were also negatively affected by an approximate 5200 increase in selling and marketing costs due to an 18 increase in the number of communities open for sale during 2005 as compared to 2004 backlog units and dollars increased 10 and 19 respectively the unit increase is primarily due to a 7 increase in the number of new orders in 2005 compared to 2004 and the dollar increase is due to the unit increase and to a 14 increase in the average selling price 

2004 versus 2003 

the north east segment had an approximate 24000 increase in segment profit year over year revenues increased 22 primarily as a result of a 7 increase in the number of units settled and a 14 increase in the average settlement price the segment’s gross profit margin percentage increased to 211 in 2004 from 188 in 2003 the increase in gross profit margins was attributable to the favorable market conditions mentioned above that allowed us to increase sales prices in a majority of the segment’s markets segment profits also benefited from the better leveraging of our costs as selling general and administrative costs as a percent of revenues decreased to 49 in 2004 from 55 in 2003 

  mid east 

2005 versus 2004 

the mid east segment had an approximate 8000 increase in segment profit year over year revenues increased 19 as a result of a 12 increase in the number of units settled and a 7 increase in the average settlement price the segment’s gross profit margin percentage was essentially flat at 189 in 2005 from 193 in 2004 segment profits were negatively affected by an approximate 13000 increase in selling general and administrative costs due to a 13 increase in the number of communities open for sale during 2005 as compared to 2004 and higher wages due to increased staffing levels to support our growth strategy backlog units and dollars increased 10 and 8 respectively the increases are primarily attributable to a 12 increase in the number of new orders in 2005 compared to 2004 

2004 versus 2003 

the mid east segment had an approximate 1000 decrease in segment profit year over year revenues increased 16 as a result of a 9 increase in the number of units settled and a 6 increase in the average settlement price the segment’s gross profit margin percentage decreased to 193 in 2004 from 208 in 2003 segment profits were also negatively affected by an approximate 9500 increase in selling general and administrative costs due to a 14 increase in the number of communities open for sale during 2004 as compared to 2003 and higher other general and administrative costs to support our growth strategy 

south east 

2005 versus 2004 

the south east segment had an approximate 15000 increase in segment profit year over year revenues increased 28 as a result of a 22 increase in the number of units settled and a 5 increase in the average settlement price the segment’s gross profit margin percentage was 199 in 2005 and 193 in 2004 the gross profit margin increase was due to favorable market conditions that provided us the opportunity to increase prices in certain of the segment’s markets segment profits were negatively affected by an approximate 5300 increase in selling general and administrative costs due to higher wages from increased staffing levels to support our growth strategy backlog units and dollars were 17 and 32 higher respectively than the 2004 year principally due to the comparative increases in new orders of 15 and average selling price of 8 

2004 versus 2003 

the south east segment had an approximate 10000 increase in segment profit year over year revenues increased 4 as a result of a 7 increase in the average settlement price and a 3 reduction in the number of units settled the segment’s gross profit margin percentage increased slightly to 193 in 2004 and 172 in 2003 

  homebuilding segment reconciliations to consolidated homebuilding operations 

in addition to the corporate capital allocation and contract land deposit impairments discussed above the other reconciling items between homebuilding segment profit and homebuilding consolidated profit before tax include unallocated corporate overhead consolidation adjustments and external corporate interest nvr’s overhead functions such as accounting treasury human resources land acquisition etc are centrally performed and the costs of which are not allocated to the company’s operating segments consolidation adjustments consist of such items to convert the reportable segments’ results which are predominantly maintained on a cash basis to a full accrual basis for external financial statement presentation purposes and are not allocated to the company’s operating segments external corporate interest expense is primarily comprised of interest charges on the company’s outstanding senior notes and working capital line borrowings and are not charged to the operating segments because the charges are included in the corporate capital allocation discussed above

  mortgage banking segment 

nvr conducts its mortgage banking activity through nvr mortgage finance inc “nvrm” a wholly owned subsidiary nvrm focuses almost exclusively on serving the homebuilding segment’s customer base following is a table of financial and statistical data for the three years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 

 

loan closing volume for the year ended december 31 2005 increased 25 from 2004 the 2005 increase was primarily attributable to a 15 increase in the average loan amount and a year over year 9 increase in the number of units closed the increase in the average loan amount reflects the aforementioned increase in the homebuilding segment’s average selling prices the unit increase for the year ended december 31 2005 reflects an increase in the number of settlements by the homebuilding segment and an increase in the percentage of the number of loans closed for nvr’s homebuyers who obtain a mortgage to purchase the home “capture rate” 

segment income for the year ended december 31 2005 increased approximately 6900 from 2004 the increase was primarily due to an increase in mortgage banking fees attributable to the aforementioned increase in closed loan volume this was net of an approximate 6000 increase in general and administrative expenses during 2005 the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in salaries and other personnel costs due to a 26 increase in the total number of nvrm employees in 2005 versus 2004 the additional staffing is to position nvrm for future growth and to increase the capture rate 

traditionally adjustable rate mortgages and brokered mortgages have been generally less profitable products than fixed rate mortgages during 2004 and early 2005 we saw a shift to these less profitable products however in the second half of 2005 with the change in interest rates the differential between fixed rate and adjustable rate mortgages narrowed and we are now experiencing a favorable product mix shift back to fixed rate mortgages we expect this product mix shift to continue into 2006 

mortgage loans held for sale increased approximately 55000 at december 31 2005 compared to december 31 2004 this was primarily due to a 46 increase in the december 2005 loan closing volume compared to december 2004 mortgage loans held for sale are typically sold to thirdparty investors within 30 days from date of closing 

loan closing volume for the year ended december 31 2004 increased 14 from 2003 the 2004 increase is primarily attributable to a 12 increase in the average loan amount and a year over year 2 increase in the number of units closed the increase in the average loan amount reflects the aforementioned increase in the homebuilding segment’s average selling prices the unit increase for the year ended december 31 2004 reflects an increase in the number of settlements by the homebuilding segment and a slight increase in the capture rate 

segment income for the year ended december 31 2004 decreased approximately 6900 from 2003 

  the decrease was primarily due to a product mix shift during 2004 from fixed rate mortgages to adjustable rate mortgages and brokered mortgages the decrease was also due to higher costs incurred of approximately 3400 related to the contractual repayment of loan sale income to investors for loans that were paid in full within a set number of days following the sale of the loan the decreases due to the product mix shift and contractual repayments was partially offset by the higher 2004 loan volume general and administrative expenses also increased by approximately 1800 from 2003 to 2004 largely due to an 15 increase in the total number of nvrm employees in 2004 versus 2003 

seasonality 

overall we do not experience material seasonal fluctuations in sales settlements or loan closings 

effective tax rate 

our consolidated effective tax rates were 390 400 and 397 in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively the lower effective tax rate in 2005 was primarily due to the favorable tax impact of the new internal revenue code section 199 domestic manufacturing deduction established by the american jobs creation act of 2004 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in december 2004 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment  “sfas 123r” sfas 123r is a revision of sfas 123 and supersedes apb no 25 sfas 123r requires that the cost resulting from all sharebased payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements and establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for sharebased payment arrangements in april 2005 the securities and exchange commission amended the effective date for sfas 123r sfas 123r is now effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period of a registrant’s first fiscal year beginning on or after june 15 2005 sfas 123r applies to all awards granted modified repurchased or cancelled after the effective date and all outstanding portions of awards granted prior to the effective date which are unvested as of the effective date of the pronouncement 

entities may adopt the provisions of sfas 123r using either the modified prospective or modified retrospective methods under the modified prospective method compensation cost is recognized on or after the required effective date for the portion of outstanding awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered based on the grantdate fair value of those awards calculated under sfas 123 for either recognition or pro forma disclosure for periods before the required effective date the modified retrospective application may be applied to either a all prior years for which sfas 123 was effective or b only to prior interim periods in the year of initial adoption on a basis consistent with the pro forma disclosures required for those periods by sfas 123 sfas 123r becomes effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2006 we plan to adopt the sfas 123r using the modified prospective method we expect our full year after tax expense to be approximately 36000 in 2006 related to the implementation of sfas 123r based on unvested stock options outstanding at december 31 2005 

liquidity and capital resources 

lines of credit and notes payable 

our homebuilding segment generally provides for its working capital cash requirements using cash generated from operations and a shortterm unsecured working capital revolving credit facility the “facility” during 2005 we increased the available borrowings under the facility to 400000 from 150000 by refinancing our previous working capital agreement the current facility now provides for borrowings of up to 400000 subject to certain borrowing base limitations the facility expires in december 2010 and outstanding amounts bear interest at either i the prime rate plus an applicable margin as defined within the facility based on nvr’s credit rating andor debt to capital ratio or ii london interbank offering rate “libor” plus applicable margin as defined above the weighted average interest rates for the amounts outstanding under the facility were 59 and 40 for 2005 and 

  2004 respectively up to 150000 of the facility is currently available for issuance in the form of letters of credit of which 26412 was outstanding at december 31 2005 the facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants the negative covenants include among others certain limitations on transactions involving the creation of guarantees sale of assets acquisitions mergers investments and land purchases additional covenants include i a minimum adjusted consolidated tangible net worth requirement ii a maximum leverage ratio requirement and iii an interest coverage ratio requirement these covenants restrict the amount in which we would be able to pay in dividends each year we are also subject to borrowing base restrictions if our senior debt rating falls below investment grade at december 31 2005 we were in compliance with all covenants under the facility and there were no borrowing base limitations reducing the amount available to us for borrowings at december 31 2005 we had direct borrowings outstanding under the facility of 103000 

nvr’s mortgage banking segment provides for its mortgage origination and other operating activities using cash generated from operations as well as various shortterm credit facilities nvrm has available an annually renewable mortgage warehouse facility the “revolving credit agreement” with an aggregate borrowing limit of 175000 this limit was temporarily increased to 225000 on december 15 2005 to accommodate heavy yearend closing volume the borrowing limit reverted back to 175000 on january 15 2006 the revolving credit agreement is used to fund nvrm’s mortgage origination activities under which 156816 was outstanding at december 31 2005 as of december 31 2005 borrowing base limitations reduced the amount available to nvrm for borrowings to approximately 184500 the revolving credit agreement expires in august 2006 the interest rate under the revolving credit agreement is either i libor plus 1125 or ii 1125 to the extent that nvrm provides compensating balances the weighted average interest rate for amounts outstanding under the revolving credit agreement was 44 during 2005 nvrm’s mortgage warehouse facility limits the ability of nvrm to transfer funds to nvr in the form of dividends loans or advances in addition nvrm is required to maintain a minimum net worth of 14000 nvrm also currently has available an aggregate of 50000 of borrowing capacity in an uncommitted gestation and repurchase agreement amounts outstanding under the uncommitted gestation and repurchase agreement accrue interest at various rates tied to the libor rate and are collateralized by gestation mortgagebacked securities and whole loans there were no borrowings under this uncommitted facility during 2005 

on january 20 1998 we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission “sec” for the issuance of up to 400000 of debt securities the “1998 shelf registration” the 1998 shelf registration statement was declared effective on february 27 1998 and provides that securities may be offered from time to time in one or more series and in the form of senior or subordinated debt 

on june 17 2003 we completed an offering at par for 200000 of 5 senior notes due 2010 the “notes” under the 1998 shelf registration the offering of the notes resulted in aggregate net proceeds of approximately 199400 after deducting offering expenses the notes mature on june 15 2010 and bear interest at 5 payable semiannually in arrears on june 15 and december 15 commencing on december 15 2003 the notes are general unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness and indebtedness under our working capital credit facility the notes are senior in right of payment to any future subordinated indebtedness that we may incur we may redeem the notes in whole or in part at any time upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days notice at a redemption price equal to the greater of a 100 of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed or b the discounted present value of the remaining scheduled payments of the notes to be redeemed plus in each case accrued and unpaid interest 

on july 14 2003 we used approximately 120700 of the proceeds received from the sale of the notes to redeem all of the 115000 outstanding 8 senior notes due 2005 at a price of 104 of the principal amount outstanding including the payment of accrued interest the redemption resulted in a charge to pretax homebuilding income of 8503 

  on may 27 2004 we filed a shelf registration statement the “2004 shelf registration” with the sec to register up to 1000000 for future offer and sale of debt securities common shares preferred shares depositary shares representing preferred shares and warrants the sec declared the 2004 shelf registration effective on june 15 2004 nvr expects to use the proceeds received from future offerings issued under the 2004 shelf registration for general corporate purposes in addition we have 55000 remaining available for issuance under the 1998 shelf registration this discussion of our shelf registration capacity does not constitute an offer of any securities for sale 

equity repurchases 

in addition to funding growth in our homebuilding and mortgage banking operations we historically have used a substantial portion of our excess liquidity to repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock in open market and privately negotiated transactions this ongoing repurchase activity is conducted pursuant to publicly announced board authorizations and is typically executed in accordance with the safeharbor provisions of rule 10b18 of the securities and exchange act of 1934 the repurchase program assists us in accomplishing our primary objective creating increases in shareholder value see part ii item 5 of the form 10k for disclosure of amounts repurchased during the fourth quarter of 2005 for the year ended december 31 2005 we repurchased approximately 1269000 shares of our common stock at an aggregate purchase price of 962609 we repurchased approximately 162000 shares of our common stock at an aggregate purchase price of 120818 during january 2006 which fully utilized all available share repurchase authorizations 

cash flows 

as shown in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended december 31 2005 our operating activities provided cash of 532772 cash was provided primarily by homebuilding operations and by the realization of a tax benefit of approximately 94000 from employee stockbased compensation activities these tax benefits were recorded directly to equity and reduced estimated tax payments during the year cash was also provided by a 53000 increase in customer deposits resulting primarily from the increase in backlog units in 2005 as compared to 2004 cash was used primarily to fund increases in homebuilding and mortgage loan inventory of approximately 202000 and 55000 respectively and to make deposits on fixed price purchase agreements with developers to acquire control of finished lots the increase in contract land deposits of approximately 196000 related to both payments for new fixed price purchase agreements and to scheduled payments under existing contracts upon achievement of development milestones we control approximately 105000 lots at december 31 2005 as compared to approximately 83500 lots at december 31 2004 

net cash used for investing activities was 22097 for the year ended december 31 2005 primarily as a result of approximately 19000 in property and equipment purchases throughout the period in addition on january 1 2005 we purchased substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of marc homebuilders inc a homebuilder in columbia south carolina for 7600 in cash see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements the acquired business operates under the rymarc trade name 

net cash used for financing activities was 700514 for the year ended december 31 2005 primarily as a result of our ongoing common stock repurchase program offset by a net increase of approximately 249000 under our credit lines we repurchased approximately 1269000 shares of our common stock in 2005 for an aggregate purchase price of 962609 

at december 31 2005 the homebuilding and mortgage banking segments had restricted cash of 5135 and 1738 respectively which includes certain customer deposits mortgagor tax escrows insurance escrows completion escrows and other amounts collected at closing which relates to mortgage loans held for sale and to home sales 

we believe that cash generated from operations and borrowings available under our credit facilities and the public debt markets will be sufficient to satisfy near and longer term cash requirements for working capital and debt service in both our homebuilding and mortgage banking operations 

  off balance sheet arrangements 

lot acquisition strategy 

we do not engage in the land development business instead we acquire finished building lots at market prices from various development entities under fixed price purchase agreements that require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the agreement the deposits required under the purchase agreements are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percentage typically ranging up to 10 of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots 

our lot acquisition strategy reduces the financial requirements and risks associated with direct land ownership and land development we may at our option choose for any reason and at any time not to perform under these purchase agreements by delivering notice of our intent not to acquire the finished lots under contract our sole legal obligation and economic loss for failure to perform under these purchase agreements is limited to the amount of the deposit pursuant to the liquidating damage provision contained within the purchase agreements we do not have any financial guarantees or completion obligations and with the exception of three specific performance contracts for 80 lots at an aggregate purchase price of approximately 7100 existing at december 31 2005 we do not guarantee specific performance under these purchase agreements 

at december 31 2005 we controlled approximately 105000 lots with an aggregate purchase price of approximately 10000000 by making or committing to make deposits of approximately 831000 in the form of cash and letters of credit our entire risk of loss pertaining to the aggregate 10000000 contractual commitment resulting from our nonperformance under the contracts is limited to the 831000 deposit amount of the 831000 deposit total approximately 600000 in cash and approximately 17000 in letters of credit have been issued as of december 31 2005 and 214000 will be paid subsequent to december 31 2005 assuming that contractual development milestones are met by the developers see contractual obligations section below please refer to note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our lot acquisition strategy in relation to our accounting under fin 46r consolidation of variable interest entities 

bonds and letters of credit 

we enter into bond or letter of credit arrangements with local municipalities government agencies or land developers to collateralize our obligations under various contracts we had 33325 of contingent obligations under such agreements as of december 31 2005 inclusive of the 17000 of lot acquisition deposits in the form of letters of credit discussed above we believe we will fulfill our obligations under the related contracts and do not anticipate any losses under these bonds or letters of credit 

mortgage commitments and forward sales 

in the normal course of business our mortgage banking segment enters into contractual commitments to extend credit to buyers of singlefamily homes with fixed expiration dates the commitments become effective when the borrowers “lockin” a specified interest rate within time frames established by us all mortgagors are evaluated for credit worthiness prior to the extension of the commitment to mitigate the effect of the interest rate risk inherent in providing rate lock commitments to borrowers we enter into optional or mandatory delivery forward sale contracts to sell whole loans and mortgagebacked securities to brokerdealers the forward sale contracts lock in an interest rate and price for the sale of loans similar to the specific rate lock commitments classified as derivatives both the rate lock commitments to borrowers and the forward sale contracts to brokerdealers are undesignated derivatives and accordingly are marked to market through earnings at december 31 2005 there were contractual commitments to extend credit to borrowers aggregating approximately 140000 and open forward delivery sale contracts aggregating approximately 322000 

  contractual obligations 

our fixed noncancelable obligations as of december 31 2005 were as follows 

 

 

 critical accounting policies 

  general 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods we continually evaluate the estimates we use to prepare the consolidated financial statements and update those estimates as necessary in general our estimates are based on historical experience on information from third party professionals and other various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances actual results could differ materially from those estimates made by management 

    variable interest entities 

revised financial interpretation no 46 “fin 46r” consolidation of variable interest entities  which was effective for us as of march 31 2004 requires the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity to consolidate that entity on its financial statements the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is the party that absorbs a majority of the variable interest entity’s expected losses receives a majority of the entity’s expected residual returns or both as a result of ownership contractual or other financial interests in the entity expected losses are the expected negative variability in the fair value of an entity’s net assets exclusive of its variable interests and expected residual returns are the expected positive variability in the fair value of an entity’s net assets exclusive of its variable interests 

forward contracts such as the fixed price purchase agreements utilized by us to acquire finished lot inventory are deemed to be variable interests under fin 46r therefore the development entities with which we enter fixed price purchase agreements are examined under fin 46r for possible consolidation by us including certain joint venture limited liability corporations “llc’s” utilized by us to acquire finished lots on a limited basis we have developed a methodology to determine whether we or conversely the owners of the applicable development entity are the primary beneficiary of a development entity the methodology used to evaluate our primary beneficiary status requires substantial management judgment and estimates these judgments and estimates involve assigning probabilities to various estimated cash flow possibilities relative to the development entity’s expected profits and losses and the cash flows associated with changes in the fair value of finished lots under contract although we believe that our accounting policy is designed to properly assess our primary beneficiary status relative to our involvement with the development entities from which we acquire finished lots changes to the probabilities and the cash flow possibilities used in our evaluation could produce widely different conclusions regarding whether we are or are not a development entity’s primary beneficiary possibly resulting in additional or fewer development entities being consolidated on our financial statements 

  homebuilding inventory 

the carrying value of inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market value cost of lots and completed and uncompleted housing units represent the accumulated actual cost of the units field construction supervisors’ salaries and related direct overhead expenses are included in inventory costs interest costs are not capitalized into inventory upon settlement the cost of the unit is expensed on a specific identification basis cost of manufacturing materials is determined on a firstin firstout basis recoverability and impairment if any is primarily evaluated by analyzing sales of comparable assets we believe that our accounting policy is designed to properly assess the carrying value of homebuilding inventory 

  contract land deposits 

we purchase finished lots under fixed price purchase agreements that require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the contract the deposits are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percentage of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots we maintain an allowance for losses on contract land deposits that we believe is sufficient to provide for losses in the existing contract land deposit portfolio the allowance reflects our judgment of the present loss exposure at the end of the reporting period considering market and economic conditions sales absorption and profitability within specific communities and terms of the various contracts although we consider the allowance for losses on contract land deposits reflected on the december 31 2005 balance sheet to be adequate there can be no assurance that this allowance will prove to be adequate over time to cover losses due to unanticipated adverse changes in the economy or other events adversely affecting specific markets or the homebuilding industry 

    intangible assets 

reorganization value in excess of identifiable assets “excess reorganization value” goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are not subject to amortization under statement of financial accounting standards no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets “sfas 142” rather excess reorganization value goodwill and other intangible assets are subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fairvalue based test we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate that the remaining value of excess reorganization value goodwill and other intangible assets may not be recoverable we completed the annual assessment of impairment during the first quarter of 2005 and as of december 31 2005 we believe that excess reorganization value goodwill and other intangible assets were not impaired this conclusion is based on management’s judgment considering such factors as our history of operating success our wellrecognized brand names and the significant positions held in the markets in which we operate however changes in strategy or adverse changes in market conditions could impact this judgment and require an impairment loss to be recognized for the amount that the carrying value of excess reorganization value goodwill andor other intangible assets exceeds their fair value 

  warranty  product liability accruals 

warranty and product liability accruals are established to provide for estimated future costs as a result of construction and product defects product recalls and litigation incidental to our business liability estimates are determined based on our judgment considering such factors as historical experience the likely current cost of corrective action manufacturers’ and subcontractors’ participation in sharing the cost of corrective action consultations with third party experts such as engineers and discussions with our general counsel and other outside counsel retained to handle specific product liability cases although we consider the warranty and product liability accrual reflected on the december 31 2005 balance sheet see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements to be adequate there can be no assurance that this accrual will prove to be adequate over time to cover losses due to increased costs for material and labor the inability or refusal of manufacturers or subcontractors to financially participate in corrective action unanticipated adverse legal settlements or other unanticipated changes to the assumptions used to estimate the warranty and product liability accrual

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk tableend 

market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates our market risk arises from interest rate risk inherent in our financial instruments interest rate risk is the possibility that changes in interest rates will cause unfavorable changes in net income or in the value of interest ratesensitive assets liabilities and commitments lower interest rates tend to increase demand for mortgage loans for home purchasers while higher interest rates make it more difficult for potential borrowers to purchase residential properties and to qualify for mortgage loans we have no market rate sensitive instruments held for speculative or trading purposes 

our mortgage banking segment is exposed to interest rate risk as it relates to its lending activities the mortgage banking segment originates mortgage loans which are either sold through optional or mandatory forward delivery contracts into the secondary markets all of the mortgage banking segment’s loan portfolio is held for sale and subject to forward sale commitments nvrm also sells substantially all of its mortgage servicing rights on a servicing released basis 

our homebuilding segment generates operating liquidity and acquires capital assets through fixedrate and variablerate debt the homebuilding segment’s primary debt is a variablerate working capital revolving credit facility that currently provides for unsecured borrowings up to 400000 subject to certain borrowing base limitations the facility expires in december 2010 and outstanding amounts bear interest at either i the prime rate plus an applicable margin as defined within the facility based on nvr’s credit rating andor debt to capital ratio or ii libor plus applicable margin as defined above the weighted average interest rates for the amounts outstanding under the facility were 59 and 40 for 2005 and 2004 respectively 

  nvrm generates operating liquidity primarily through the mortgage warehouse facility which had a borrowing limit of 225000 at december 31 2005 the available borrowing limit was reduced to 175000 on january 15 2006 the mortgage warehouse facility is used to fund its mortgage origination activities the interest rate under the mortgage warehouse facility is either i libor plus 1125 or ii 1125 to the extent that nvrm provides compensating balances the weightedaverage interest rate for amounts outstanding under the mortgage warehouse facility was 44 during 2005 

the following table represents the contractual balances of our onbalance sheet financial instruments in dollars at the expected maturity dates as well as the fair values of those onbalance sheet financial instruments at december 31 2005 the expected maturity categories take into consideration the actual and anticipated amortization of principal and does not take into consideration the reinvestment of cash or the refinancing of existing indebtedness because we sell all of the mortgage loans we originate into the secondary markets we have made the assumption that the portfolio of mortgage loans held for sale will mature in the first year consequently outstanding warehouse borrowings and repurchase facilities are also assumed to mature in the first year

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

as of the end of the period covered by this report an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 

based on that evaluation the principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2005 were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the securities and exchange act of 1934 is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

as described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements we have amended note 2 to disaggregate our one homebuilding segment into four reportable segments our management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have reevaluated our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report to determine whether this amendment changes their prior conclusion and have determined that it does not change their conclusion that as of december 31 2005 our disclosure controls and procedures were effective the change in the way we report segment information did not result in any change to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

there have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation referred to above that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in rule 13a15f under the securities and exchange act of 1934 under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on our evaluation under the framework in internal control — integrated framework  our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2005 our management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2005 has been audited by kpmg llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which is included herein 

  as described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements we have amended note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report to disaggregate our one homebuilding segment into four reportable segments as a result management has reevaluated its assessment regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting we have concluded that our prior assessment that our internal control over financial reporting was effective at december 31 2005 is correct this determination was based upon the fact that we believe that our internal control over financial reporting operated in a manner that provided us with a reasonable basis for our original conclusion with respect to reporting segment information further the change in the way we report segment information did not result in any change to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

 item 1 business 

general 

nvr inc “nvr” was formed in 1980 as nvhomes inc nvr operates in two business segments homebuilding and mortgage banking nvr conducts its homebuilding activities directly except for rymarc homes which is operated as a wholly owned subsidiary and its mortgage banking operations which is operated primarily through a wholly owned subsidiary nvr mortgage finance inc “nvrm” unless the context otherwise requires references to “nvr” “we” “us” or “our” include nvr and its subsidiaries 

we are one of the largest homebuilders in the united states and in the washington dc and baltimore md metropolitan areas while we operate in multiple locations in thirteen states primarily in the eastern part of the united states approximately 38 of our home settlements in 2005 occurred in the washington dc and baltimore md metropolitan areas which accounted for 52 of our 2005 homebuilding revenues our homebuilding operations include the construction and sale of singlefamily detached homes townhomes and condominium buildings under four trade names ryan homes nvhomes fox ridge homes and rymarc homes the ryan homes fox ridge homes and rymarc homes products are moderately priced and marketed primarily to firsttime homeowners and firsttime moveup buyers the ryan homes product is currently sold in twentyone metropolitan areas located in maryland virginia west virginia pennsylvania new york north carolina south carolina ohio new jersey delaware michigan and kentucky the fox ridge homes product is sold solely in the nashville tn metropolitan area and the rymarc homes product is sold solely in the columbia south carolina market the nvhomes product is marketed primarily to moveup and upscale buyers and is sold in the washington dc baltimore md philadelphia pa and the maryland eastern shore metropolitan areas in 2005 our average price of a unit settled was approximately 375000 

we do not engage in the land development business instead we acquire finished building lots at market prices from various development entities under fixed price purchase agreements that require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the agreement the deposits required under the purchase agreements are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percentage typically ranging up to 10 of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots 

our lot acquisition strategy reduces the financial requirements and risks associated with direct land ownership and land development we may at our option choose for any reason and at any time not to perform under these purchase agreements by delivering notice of our intent not to acquire the finished lots under contract our sole legal obligation and economic loss for failure to perform under these purchase agreements is limited to the amount of the deposit pursuant to the liquidating damage provision contained within the purchase agreements we do not have any financial guarantees or completion obligations and with the exception of three specific performance contracts for 80 lots existing at december 31 2005 we do not guarantee specific performance under these purchase agreements we generally seek to maintain control over a supply of lots believed to be suitable to meet our sales objectives for the next 24 to 36 months 

on a very limited basis nvr also obtains finished lots using joint venture limited liability corporations “llc’s” all llc’s are structured such that nvr is a noncontrolling member and is at risk only for the amount invested nvr is not a borrower guarantor or obligor on any of the llc’s debt nvr enters into a standard fixed price purchase agreement to purchase lots from these llc’s at december 31 2005 nvr had an aggregate investment in thirteen separate llc’s totaling approximately 15 million which controlled approximately 1000 lots 

  in addition to building and selling homes we provide a number of mortgagerelated services through our mortgage banking operations through operations in each of our homebuilding markets nvrm originates mortgage loans almost exclusively for our homebuyers nvrm generates revenues primarily from origination fees gains on sales of loans and title fees nvrm sells all of the mortgage loans it closes into the secondary markets on a servicing released basis 

segment information for our homebuilding and mortgage banking businesses is included in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

homebuilding 

  products 

we offer singlefamily detached homes townhomes and condominium buildings with many different basic home designs these home designs have a variety of elevations and numerous other options our homes combine traditional or colonial exterior designs with contemporary interior designs and amenities generally include two to four bedrooms and range from approximately 1000 to 7300 square feet during 2005 the prices of our homes ranged from approximately 90000 to 2000000 

  markets 

we operate in the following geographic regions 

 

further discussion of settlements new orders and backlog activity by region for each of the last three years can be found in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations see item 7 of this report 

  backlog 

backlog totaled 8310 units and approximately 37 billion at december 31 2005 compared to backlog of 7372 units and approximately 29 billion at december 31 2004 our cancellation rate was approximately 12 during 2005 assuming that our cancellation rate in 2006 is consistent with that experienced in 2005 approximately 88 of the units in backlog at december 31 2005 will settle in 2006 however we can provide no assurance that our historical cancellation rate is indicative of the actual cancellation rate that may occur in 2006 see risk factors in item 1a 

  construction 

we utilize independent subcontractors under fixed price contracts to perform construction work on our homes the subcontractors’ work is performed under the supervision of our employees who monitor quality control we use many independent subcontractors in our various markets and we are not dependent on any single subcontractor or on a small number of subcontractors 

  land development 

we are not in the land development business we purchase finished lots from various land developers under fixed price purchase agreements that require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the agreement the deposits required under the purchase agreements are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percentage typically ranging up to 10 of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots we are not dependent on any single developer or on a small number of developers 

    sales and marketing 

our preferred marketing method is for customers to visit a furnished model home featuring many builtin options and a landscaped lot the garages of these model homes are usually converted into temporary sales centers where alternative facades and floor plans are displayed and designs for other models are available for review sales representatives are compensated predominantly on a commission basis 

  regulation 

nvr and its subcontractors must comply with various federal state and local zoning building environmental advertising and consumer credit statutes rules and regulations as well as other regulations and requirements in connection with our construction and sales activities all of these regulations have increased the cost to produce and market our products and in some instances have delayed our developers’ abilities to deliver us finished lots counties and cities in which we build homes have at times declared moratoriums on the issuance of building permits and imposed other restrictions in the areas in which sewage treatment facilities and other public facilities do not reach minimum standards to date restrictive zoning laws and the imposition of moratoriums have not had a material adverse effect on our construction activities however in certain markets in which we operate we believe that our growth has been hampered by the longer time periods necessary for our developers to move projects through the approval process 

  competition and market factors 

the housing industry is highly competitive we compete with numerous homebuilders of varying size ranging from local to national in scope some of which have greater financial resources than we do we also face competition from the home resale market our homebuilding operations compete primarily on the basis of price location design quality service and reputation we historically have been one of the market leaders in each of the markets where we build homes 

the housing industry is cyclical and is affected by consumer confidence levels prevailing economic conditions and interest rates other factors that affect the housing industry and the demand for new homes include the availability and increases in the cost of land labor and materials changes in consumer preferences demographic trends and the availability of mortgage finance programs 

we are dependent upon building material suppliers for a continuous flow of raw materials whenever possible we utilize standard products available from multiple sources in the past such raw materials have been generally available to us in adequate supply 

mortgage banking 

we provide a number of mortgage related services to our homebuilding customers through our mortgage banking operations our mortgage banking operations also include separate subsidiaries that broker title insurance and perform title searches in connection with mortgage loan closings for which they receive commissions and fees because nvrm originates mortgage loans almost exclusively for our homebuilding customers nvrm is dependent on our homebuilding segment in 2005 nvrm closed approximately 11300 loans with an aggregate principal amount of approximately 34 billion 

nvrm sells all of the mortgage loans it closes to investors in the secondary markets on a servicing released basis typically within 30 days from the loan closing nvrm is an approved sellerservicer for fnma gnma fhlmc va and fha mortgage loans 

    competition and market factors 

nvrm’s main competition comes from national regional and local mortgage bankers mortgage brokers thrifts and banks in each of these markets nvrm competes primarily on the basis of customer service variety of products offered interest rates offered prices of ancillary services and relative financing availability and costs 

  regulation 

nvrm is an approved sellerservicer of fnma gnma fhlmc fha and va mortgage loans and is subject to all of those agencies’ rules and regulations these rules and regulations restrict certain activities of nvrm nvrm is currently eligible and expects to remain eligible to participate in such programs in addition nvrm is subject to regulation at the state and federal level with respect to specific origination selling and servicing practices 

  pipeline 

nvrm’s mortgage loans in process that have not closed “pipeline” at december 31 2005 and 2004 had an aggregate principal balance of 21 billion and 19 billion respectively our cancellation rate was approximately 25 in 2005 assuming that the cancellation rate in 2006 is consistent with that experienced in 2005 approximately 75 of the pipeline at december 31 2005 is expected to close in 2006 however we can provide no assurance that the prior year cancellation rate is indicative of the actual cancellation rate that may occur in 2006 see risk factors in item 1a 

employees 

at december 31 2005 we employed 5401 fulltime persons of whom 2151 were officers and management personnel 345 were technical and construction personnel 1039 were sales personnel 823 were administrative personnel and 1043 were engaged in various other service and labor activities none of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement and we have never experienced a work stoppage we believe that our employee relations are good

some of the statements in this form 10k as well as statements made by nvr inc “nvr” in periodic press releases or other public communications constitute “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 section 27a of the securities act of 1933 as amended and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 certain but not necessarily all of such forwardlooking statements can be identified by the use of forwardlooking terminology such as “believes” “expects” “may” “will” “should” or “anticipates” or the negative thereof or other comparable terminology all statements other than of historical facts are forward looking statements forward looking statements contained in this document include those regarding market trends nvr’s financial position business strategy projected plans and objectives of management for future operations such forwardlooking statements involve known and unknown risks uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results or performance of nvr to be materially different from future results performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forwardlooking statements such risk factors include but are not limited to the following general economic and business conditions on both a national and regional level interest rate changes access to suitable financing competition the availability and cost of land and other raw materials used by nvr in its homebuilding operations shortages of labor weather related slowdowns building moratoriums governmental regulation the ability of nvr to integrate any acquired business fluctuation and volatility of stock and other financial markets and other factors over which nvr has little or no control 

risk factors 

our business is affected by the risks generally incident to the residential construction business including but not limited to 

 

interest rate movements inflation and other economic factors can negatively impact our business 

high rates of inflation generally affect the homebuilding industry adversely because of their adverse impact on interest rates high interest rates not only increase the cost of borrowed funds to homebuilders but also have a significant effect on housing demand and on the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective purchasers we are also subject to potential volatility in the price of commodities that impact costs of materials used in our homebuilding business increases in prevailing interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations 

our financial results also are affected by the risks generally incident to our mortgage banking business including interest rate levels the impact of government regulation on mortgage loan originations and servicing and the need to issue forward commitments to fund and sell mortgage loans our homebuilding customers accounted for almost all of our mortgage banking business in 2005 the volume of our continuing homebuilding operations therefore affects our mortgage banking business 

  our operations may also be adversely affected by other economic factors within our markets such as negative changes in employment levels job growth and consumer confidence one or all of which could result in reduced demand or price depression from current levels such negative trends could have a material adverse effect on homebuilding operations 

our mortgage banking business also is affected by interest rate fluctuations we also may experience marketing losses resulting from daily increases in interest rates to the extent we are unable to match interest rates and amounts on loans we have committed to originate with forward commitments from third parties to purchase such loans increases in interest rates may have a material adverse effect on our mortgage banking revenue profitability stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations 

these factors and thus the homebuilding business have at times in the past been cyclical in nature any downturn in the national economy or the local economies of the markets in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations in particular approximately 38 of our home settlements during 2005 occurred in the washington dc and baltimore md metropolitan areas which accounted for 52 of our 2005 homebuilding revenues thus we are dependent to a significant extent on the economy and demand for housing in those areas 

our inability to secure and control an adequate inventory of lots could adversely impact our operations 

the results of our homebuilding operations are dependent upon our continuing ability to control an adequate number of homebuilding lots in desirable locations there can be no assurance that an adequate supply of building lots will continue to be available to us on terms similar to those available in the past or that we will not be required to devote a greater amount of capital to controlling building lots than we have historically an insufficient supply of building lots in one or more of our markets an inability of our developers to deliver finished lots in a timely fashion or our inability to purchase or finance building lots on reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations 

if the market value of our inventory declines our profit could decrease 

inventory risk can be substantial for homebuilders the market value of building lots and housing inventories can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing market conditions in addition inventory carrying costs can be significant and can result in losses in a poorly performing project or market we must in the ordinary course of our business continuously seek and make acquisitions of lots for expansion into new markets as well as for replacement and expansion within our current markets in the event of significant changes in economic or market conditions we may dispose of certain subdivision inventories on a bulk or other basis which may result in a loss which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations 

our current indebtedness may impact our future operations and our ability to access necessary financing 

our homebuilding operations are dependent in part on the availability and cost of working capital financing and may be adversely affected by a shortage or an increase in the cost of such financing if we require working capital greater than that provided by our operations and our credit facility we may be required to seek to increase the amount available under the facility or to obtain alternative financing no assurance can be given that additional or replacement financing will be available on terms that are favorable or acceptable if we are at any time unsuccessful in obtaining sufficient capital to fund our planned homebuilding expenditures we may experience a substantial delay in the completion of any homes then under construction any delay could result in cost increases and could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

  our existing indebtedness contains financial and other restrictive covenants and any future indebtedness may also contain covenants these covenants include limitations on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness pay cash dividends and make distributions make loans and investments enter into transactions with affiliates effect certain asset sales incur certain liens merge or consolidate with any other person or transfer all or substantially all of our properties and assets substantial losses by us or other action or inaction by us or our subsidiaries could result in the violation of one or more of these covenants which could result in decreased liquidity or a default on our indebtedness thereby having a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations 

our mortgage banking operations are dependent on the availability cost and other terms of mortgage warehouse financing and may be adversely affected by any shortage or increased cost of such financing no assurance can be given that any additional or replacement financing will be available on terms that are favorable or acceptable our mortgage banking operations are also dependent upon the securitization market for mortgagebacked securities and could be materially adversely affected by any fluctuation or downturn in such market 

government regulations and environmental matters can negatively affect our operations 

we are subject to various local state and federal statutes ordinances rules and regulations concerning zoning building design construction and similar matters including local regulations that impose restrictive zoning and density requirements in order to limit the number of homes that can eventually be built within the boundaries of a particular area we have from time to time been subject to and may also be subject in the future to periodic delays in our homebuilding projects due to building moratoriums in the areas in which we operate changes in regulations that restrict homebuilding activities in one or more of our principal markets could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations 

we are also subject to a variety of local state and federal statutes ordinances rules and regulations concerning the protection of health and the environment we are subject to a variety of environmental conditions that can affect our business and our homebuilding projects the particular environmental laws that apply to any given homebuilding site vary greatly according to the location and environmental condition of the site and the present and former uses of the site and adjoining properties environmental laws and conditions may result in delays cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs or prohibit or severely restrict homebuilding activity in certain environmentally sensitive regions or areas thereby adversely affecting our sales profitability stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations 

we are an approved sellerservicer of fnma gnma fhlmc fha and va mortgage loans and are subject to all of those agencies’ rules and regulations any significant impairment of our eligibility to sellservice these loans could have a material adverse impact on our mortgage operations in addition we are subject to regulation at the state and federal level with respect to specific origination selling and servicing practices adverse changes in governmental regulation may have a negative impact on our mortgage loan origination business 

we face competition in our housing and mortgage banking operations 

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive we compete with numerous homebuilders of varying size ranging from local to national in scope some of whom have greater financial resources than we do we face competition 

 

our homebuilding operations compete primarily on the basis of price location design quality service and reputation historically we have been one of the leading homebuilders in each of the markets where we operate 

  the mortgage banking industry is also competitive our main competition comes from national regional and local mortgage bankers thrifts banks and mortgage brokers in each of these markets our mortgage banking operations compete primarily on the basis of customer service variety of products offered interest rates offered prices of ancillary services and relative financing availability and costs 

there can be no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully in our homebuilding or mortgage banking operations an inability to effectively compete may have an adverse impact on our sales profitability stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations 

a shortage of building materials or labor may adversely impact our operations 

the homebuilding business has from time to time experienced building material and labor shortages including shortages in insulation drywall certain carpentry work and concrete as well as fluctuating lumber prices and supply in addition high employment levels and strong construction market conditions could restrict the labor force available to our subcontractors and us in one or more of our markets significant increases in costs resulting from these shortages or delays in construction of homes could have a material adverse effect upon our sales profitability stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations 

product liability litigation and warranty claims may adversely impact our operations 

construction defect and home warranty claims are common and can represent a substantial risk for the homebuilding industry the cost of insuring against construction defect and product liability claims as well as the claims themselves can be high in addition insurance companies limit coverage offered to protect against these claims further restrictions on coverage available or significant increases in premium costs or claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

weatherrelated and other events beyond our control may adversely impact our operations 

extreme weather or other events such as hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes forest fires floods terrorist attacks or war may affect our markets our operations and our profitability these events may impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or subcontractors causing us material increases in costs or delays in construction of homes which could have a material adverse effect upon our sales profitability stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations

 item 3 legal proceedings 

 in thousands 

we are involved in various claims and litigation arising principally in the ordinary course of business at this time we are not involved in any legal proceedings that we believe are likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

in april 2005 the united states environmental protection agency the “epa” notified nvr that the company was allegedly in violation of section 308a of the clean water act the “act” at a construction site in pennsylvania relative to storm water management during the homebuilding construction process the notice informed nvr that the company might be subject to administrative fines of up to 157 for the alleged violations subsequently in september 2005 nvr received a request from the epa pursuant to the act for information about storm water discharge practices utilized in connection with other recent homebuilding projects undertaken by the company nvr is working with the epa to provide the requested information and to review nvr’s compliance with the act it is not known at this time whether the epa will seek to take legal action or impose penalties in connection with the alleged violation at the construction site in pennsylvania

we have never paid a cash dividend on our shares of common stock in addition we do not expect to pay a cash dividend in the foreseeable future as we continue with our objective of increasing shareholder value by using earnings to fund continued growth in our homebuilding and mortgage banking operations we may from time to time repurchase shares of our common stock to also further that objective our bank indebtedness contains certain restrictive covenants which limit our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock see further discussion of the covenants in the liquidity section of part ii item 7 of the form 10k

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  dollars in thousands except per share data 

results of operations for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 

overview 

our primary business is the construction and sale of singlefamily detached homes townhomes and condominium buildings to fully serve our homebuilding customers we also operate a mortgage banking and title services business we primarily conduct our operations in mature supplyconstrained markets additionally we generally grow our business through market share gains in our existing markets and by expanding into markets contiguous to our current active markets we currently operate in the following regions 

 

  we believe we operate our business with a conservative operating strategy we do not engage in land development and primarily construct homes on a presold basis this strategy allows us to maximize inventory turnover which enables us to minimize market risk and to operate with less capital thereby enhancing rates of return on equity and total capital in addition we focus on obtaining and maintaining a leading market position in each market we serve this strategy allows us to gain valuable efficiencies and competitive advantages in our markets which we believe contributes to minimizing the adverse effects of regional economic cycles and provides growth opportunities within these markets 

because we are not active in the land development business our continued success is contingent upon our ability to control an adequate supply of finished lots on which to build and on our developers’ ability to timely deliver finished lots to meet the sales demands of our customers timely delivery of lots by our developers can be influenced by many factors such as the developer’s execution of improvements weatherrelated impacts and the length of time necessary to obtain governmental approval of projects we have been impacted in the past year and may be negatively impacted in the future by development delays 

we acquire finished building lots at market prices from various development entities under fixed price purchase agreements “purchase agreements” these purchase agreements require deposits in the form of cash or letters of credit that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the purchase agreement however we believe that this lot acquisition strategy reduces the financial requirements and risks associated with direct land ownership and development as of december 31 2005 we controlled approximately 105000 lots with deposits in cash and letters of credit totaling approximately 600000 and 17000 respectively we also controlled approximately 1000 lots through investments in joint venture limited liability corporations 

consolidated revenues and net income for 2005 increased 22 and 33 respectively from 2004 the increase in net income coupled with our continuing share repurchase program resulted in a 35 increase in diluted earnings per share in 2005 compared to 2004 the increase in consolidated revenues was primarily driven by our homebuilding business where we experienced an 8 increase in the number of homes settled and a 13 increase in the average settlement price in 2005 from 2004 in addition the value of homes in backlog at december 31 2005 exceeded the december 31 2004 backlog value by 26

the following tables summarizes homebuilding settlements new orders and backlog activity by region for each of the last three years 

 

   

the following table summarizes the results of operations for each of the last three years for our homebuilding segment 

 

revenues 

homebuilding revenues for 2005 increased 22 from 2004 primarily as a result of a 13 increase in the average settlement price and an 8 increase in the number of homes settled each of these increases was driven by a stronger backlog both in value and units at the beginning of 2005 as compared to the beginning of 2004 due to the company’s overall growth and our ability to raise prices year over year during a period of strong housing demand we experienced increased home settlements year over year in each of our regions except baltimore where settlements declined slightly from the prior year settlements in the baltimore region were negatively affected by development delays throughout the first three quarters of 2005 the baltimore region was able to resolve several of these development delays in the fourth quarter and settlements for this region increased 24 in the fourth quarter of 2005 as compared to the same period in 2004 

homebuilding revenues for 2004 increased 18 from 2003 primarily as a result of a 12 increase in the average settlement price to 3322 in 2004 from 2979 in 2003 and an increase of 6 in the number of homes settled to 12749 in 2004 from 12050 in 2003 the increase in average settlement prices was primarily attributable to a 9 higher average price of homes in backlog entering 2004 as compared to 2003 and to a 16 increase in the average price of homes sold during the first six months of 2004 as compared to the same period in 2003 the increase in the number of homes settled was primarily attributable to an 8 higher backlog at the beginning of 2004 as compared to the beginning of 2003 

new orders 

the number of new orders for 2005 increased 11 from 2004 and the value of new orders for 2005 increased 23 to 5928815 from 4817780 in 2004 the increase in the number of new orders was primarily attributable to an overall increase in the average number of active communities to 522 in 2005 as compared to 450 in 2004 strong new order growth was experienced in each of our regions except the washington region which remained relatively flat with the prior year sales in the washington region were negatively impacted by lower sales absorption during the second half of the year as compared to the same period in 2004 as a result of generally weaker market conditions within the region the 23 increase in the value of new orders was attributable to both the aforementioned increase in the number of new orders and sustained housing demand year over year which provided us the opportunity to raise selling prices resulting in an 11 increase in the average selling price in 2005 as compared to 2004 

  the number of new orders for 2004 increased 5 from 2003 while the value of new orders for 2004 increased 22 to 4817780 from 3950413 in 2003 the increase in the number of new orders was attributable to an overall increase in the average number of active communities to 450 in 2004 as compared to 433 in 2003 increases year over year in new orders in the washington north and south regions were offset partially by a 9 decrease in new orders for the baltimore region this decrease resulted primarily from a 7 decrease in the average number of active communities in the baltimore region year over year attributable primarily to development delays the 22 increase in the value of new orders was primarily attributable to the aforementioned increase in the number of new orders and strong housing demand which provided us the opportunity to raise selling prices resulting in a 16 increase in the average selling price in 2004 as compared to 2003 

gross profit 

the increase in gross profit margins of 210 basis points 21 in 2005 from 2004 was primarily attributable to the aforementioned increases in average settlement prices year over year these increases were partially offset by higher land and building commodity prices in 2005 as compared to 2004 many of the end product building supplies used in our construction operations are impacted by higher more volatile energy and petroleum costs including osb sheathing siding material pvc piping paint asphalt shingles cement gypsum steel glass and insulation we are actively engaged in managing these cost increases to minimize their potential margin impact however gross margins in future periods may be adversely impacted by these higher costs as well as expected pricing pressures in 2006 in many of our markets 

gross profit margins for 2004 increased to 257 compared to 247 for 2003 the increase in profit margins was attributable to the favorable market conditions allowing us to increase sales prices in a majority of the markets leading to the aforementioned 12 increase in average settlement prices in 2004 as compared to 2003 these increases were partially offset by higher land lumber and other commodity prices in 2004 as compared to 2003 

selling general and administrative “sga” 

sga for 2005 increased 84630 or 32 from 2004 and as a percentage of revenues increased to 67 in 2005 from 61 in 2004 the increase in sga costs was primarily attributable to increases in personnel costs and selling and marketing costs of approximately 43400 and 26500 respectively personnel costs have increased primarily as a result of increased wages and management incentive compensation due to increased staffing levels to support our growth strategy as of december 31 2005 sga staffing levels had increased approximately 23 from december 31 2004 the increase in selling and marketing costs were attributable to an increase in advertising and selling support costs due to the aforementioned increase in the average number of active communities year over year sga costs in 2006 will be negatively impacted as a result of the implementation of statement of financial accounting standards no 123r sharebased payment  “sfas 123r” from which we expect to record after tax expense of approximately 36000 for the year based on unvested stock options outstanding at december 31 2005 see recent accounting pronouncements section which follows within item 7 for further discussion 

sga for 2004 increased 12 from 2003 but as a percentage of revenues decreased to 61 in 2004 from 64 in 2003 the increase in sga costs was primarily attributable to increased personnel costs and selling and marketing costs of approximately 11500 and 10400 respectively due to our continued growth 

  backlog 

backlog units and dollars were 8310 and 3673221 respectively at december 31 2005 compared to backlog units of 7372 and dollars of 2906041 at december 31 2004 the increase in backlog units was due primarily to a 10 increase in the number of new orders for the sixmonth period ended december 31 2005 as compared to the same period ended december 31 2004 the 26 increase in backlog dollars was attributable to the 13 increase in backlog units and a 7 increase in the average price of new orders for the sixmonth period ended december 31 2005 as compared to the same period in 2004 

backlog units and dollars were 7372 and 2906041 respectively at december 31 2004 compared to backlog units of 6890 and dollars of 2323703 at december 31 2003 the increase in backlog units was due primarily to a 6 increase in the number of new orders for the sixmonth period ended december 31 2004 as compared to the same period ended december 31 2003 the 25 increase in backlog dollars was attributable to the 7 increase in backlog units and a 16 increase in the average price of new orders for the sixmonth period ended december 31 2004 as compared to the same period in 2003 

mortgage banking segment 

nvr conducts its mortgage banking activity through nvr mortgage finance inc “nvrm” a wholly owned subsidiary nvrm focuses almost exclusively on serving the homebuilding segment’s customer base following is a table of financial and statistical data for the three years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 

 

loan closing volume for the year ended december 31 2005 increased 25 from 2004 the 2005 increase was primarily attributable to a 15 increase in the average loan amount and a year over year 9 increase in the number of units closed the increase in the average loan amount reflects the aforementioned increase in the homebuilding segment’s average selling prices the unit increase for the year ended december 31 2005 reflects an increase in the number of settlements by the homebuilding segment and an increase in the percentage of the number of loans closed for nvr’s homebuyers who obtain a mortgage to purchase the home “capture rate” 

segment income for the year ended december 31 2005 increased approximately 6900 from 2004 the increase was primarily due to an increase in mortgage banking fees attributable to the aforementioned increase in closed loan volume this was net of an approximate 6000 increase in general and administrative expenses during 2005 the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in salaries and other personnel costs due to a 26 increase in the total number of nvrm employees in 2005 versus 2004 the additional staffing is to position nvrm for future growth and to increase the capture rate 

traditionally adjustable rate mortgages and brokered mortgages have been generally less profitable products than fixed rate mortgages during 2004 and early 2005 we saw a shift to these less profitable products however in the second half of 2005 with the change in interest rates the differential between fixed rate and adjustable rate mortgages narrowed and we are now experiencing a favorable product mix shift back to fixed rate mortgages we expect this product mix shift to continue into 2006 

mortgage loans held for sale increased approximately 55000 at december 31 2005 compared to december 31 2004 this was primarily due to a 46 increase in the december 2005 loan closing volume 

  compared to december 2004 mortgage loans held for sale are typically sold to thirdparty investors within 30 days from date of closing 

loan closing volume for the year ended december 31 2004 increased 14 from 2003 the 2004 increase is primarily attributable to a 12 increase in the average loan amount and a year over year 2 increase in the number of units closed the increase in the average loan amount reflects the aforementioned increase in the homebuilding segment’s average selling prices the unit increase for the year ended december 31 2004 reflects an increase in the number of settlements by the homebuilding segment and a slight increase in the capture rate 

segment income for the year ended december 31 2004 decreased approximately 6900 from 2003 the decrease was primarily due to a product mix shift during 2004 from fixed rate mortgages to adjustable rate mortgages and brokered mortgages the decrease was also due to higher costs incurred of approximately 3400 related to the contractual repayment of loan sale income to investors for loans that were paid in full within a set number of days following the sale of the loan the decreases due to the product mix shift and contractual repayments was partially offset by the higher 2004 loan volume general and administrative expenses also increased by approximately 1800 from 2003 to 2004 largely due to an 15 increase in the total number of nvrm employees in 2004 versus 2003 

seasonality 

overall we do not experience material seasonal fluctuations in sales settlements or loan closings 

effective tax rate 

our consolidated effective tax rates were 390 400 and 397 in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively the lower effective tax rate in 2005 was primarily due to the favorable tax impact of the new internal revenue code section 199 domestic manufacturing deduction established by the american jobs creation act of 2004 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in december 2004 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment  “sfas 123r” sfas 123r is a revision of sfas 123 and supersedes apb no 25 sfas 123r requires that the cost resulting from all sharebased payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements and establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for sharebased payment arrangements in april 2005 the securities and exchange commission amended the effective date for sfas 123r sfas 123r is now effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period of a registrant’s first fiscal year beginning on or after june 15 2005 sfas 123r applies to all awards granted modified repurchased or cancelled after the effective date and all outstanding portions of awards granted prior to the effective date which are unvested as of the effective date of the pronouncement 

entities may adopt the provisions of sfas 123r using either the modified prospective or modified retrospective methods under the modified prospective method compensation cost is recognized on or after the required effective date for the portion of outstanding awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered based on the grantdate fair value of those awards calculated under sfas 123 for either recognition or pro forma disclosure for periods before the required effective date the modified retrospective application may be applied to either a all prior years for which sfas 123 was effective or b only to prior interim periods in the year of initial adoption on a basis consistent with the pro forma disclosures required for those periods by sfas 123 sfas 123r becomes effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2006 we plan to adopt the sfas 123r using the modified prospective method we expect our full year after tax expense to be approximately 36000 in 2006 related to the implementation of sfas 123r based on unvested stock options outstanding at december 31 2005 

  liquidity and capital resources 

lines of credit and notes payable 

our homebuilding segment generally provides for its working capital cash requirements using cash generated from operations and a shortterm unsecured working capital revolving credit facility the “facility” during 2005 we increased the available borrowings under the facility to 400000 from 150000 by refinancing our previous working capital agreement the current facility now provides for borrowings of up to 400000 subject to certain borrowing base limitations the facility expires in december 2010 and outstanding amounts bear interest at either i the prime rate plus an applicable margin as defined within the facility based on nvr’s credit rating andor debt to capital ratio or ii london interbank offering rate “libor” plus applicable margin as defined above the weightedaverage interest rates for the amounts outstanding under the facility were 59 and 40 for 2005 and 2004 respectively up to 150000 of the facility is currently available for issuance in the form of letters of credit of which 26412 was outstanding at december 31 2005 the facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants the negative covenants include among others certain limitations on transactions involving the creation of guarantees sale of assets acquisitions mergers investments and land purchases additional covenants include i a minimum adjusted consolidated tangible net worth requirement ii a maximum leverage ratio requirement and iii an interest coverage ratio requirement these covenants restrict the amount in which we would be able to pay in dividends each year we are also subject to borrowing base restrictions if our senior debt rating falls below investment grade at december 31 2005 we were in compliance with all covenants under the facility and there were no borrowing base limitations reducing the amount available to us for borrowings at december 31 2005 we had direct borrowings outstanding under the facility of 103000 

nvr’s mortgage banking segment provides for its mortgage origination and other operating activities using cash generated from operations as well as various shortterm credit facilities nvrm has available an annually renewable mortgage warehouse facility the “revolving credit agreement” with an aggregate borrowing limit of 175000 this limit was temporarily increased to 225000 on december 15 2005 to accommodate heavy yearend closing volume the borrowing limit reverted back to 175000 on january 15 2006 the revolving credit agreement is used to fund nvrm’s mortgage origination activities under which 156816 was outstanding at december 31 2005 as of december 31 2005 borrowing base limitations reduced the amount available to nvrm for borrowings to approximately 184500 the revolving credit agreement expires in august 2006 the interest rate under the revolving credit agreement is either i libor plus 1125 or ii 1125 to the extent that nvrm provides compensating balances the weighted average interest rate for amounts outstanding under the revolving credit agreement was 44 during 2005 nvrm’s mortgage warehouse facility limits the ability of nvrm to transfer funds to nvr in the form of dividends loans or advances in addition nvrm is required to maintain a minimum net worth of 14000 nvrm also currently has available an aggregate of 50000 of borrowing capacity in an uncommitted gestation and repurchase agreement amounts outstanding under the uncommitted gestation and repurchase agreement accrue interest at various rates tied to the libor rate and are collateralized by gestation mortgagebacked securities and whole loans there were no borrowings under this uncommitted facility during 2005 

on january 20 1998 we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission “sec” for the issuance of up to 400000 of debt securities the “1998 shelf registration” the 1998 shelf registration statement was declared effective on february 27 1998 and provides that securities may be offered from time to time in one or more series and in the form of senior or subordinated debt 

on june 17 2003 we completed an offering at par for 200000 of 5 senior notes due 2010 the “notes” under the 1998 shelf registration the offering of the notes resulted in aggregate net proceeds of approximately 199400 after deducting offering expenses the notes mature on june 15 2010 and bear interest at 5 payable semiannually in arrears on june 15 and december 15 commencing on december 15 2003 

  the notes are general unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness and indebtedness under our working capital credit facility the notes are senior in right of payment to any future subordinated indebtedness that we may incur we may redeem the notes in whole or in part at any time upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days notice at a redemption price equal to the greater of a 100 of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed or b the discounted present value of the remaining scheduled payments of the notes to be redeemed plus in each case accrued and unpaid interest 

on july 14 2003 we used approximately 120700 of the proceeds received from the sale of the notes to redeem all of the 115000 outstanding 8 senior notes due 2005 at a price of 104 of the principal amount outstanding including the payment of accrued interest the redemption resulted in a charge to pretax homebuilding income of 8503 

on may 27 2004 we filed a shelf registration statement the “2004 shelf registration” with the sec to register up to 1000000 for future offer and sale of debt securities common shares preferred shares depositary shares representing preferred shares and warrants the sec declared the 2004 shelf registration effective on june 15 2004 nvr expects to use the proceeds received from future offerings issued under the 2004 shelf registration for general corporate purposes in addition we have 55000 remaining available for issuance under the 1998 shelf registration this discussion of our shelf registration capacity does not constitute an offer of any securities for sale 

equity repurchases 

in addition to funding growth in our homebuilding and mortgage banking operations we historically have used a substantial portion of our excess liquidity to repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock in open market and privately negotiated transactions this ongoing repurchase activity is conducted pursuant to publicly announced board authorizations and is typically executed in accordance with the safeharbor provisions of rule 10b18 of the securities and exchange act of 1934 the repurchase program assists us in accomplishing our primary objective creating increases in shareholder value see part ii item 5 of the form 10k for disclosure of amounts repurchased during the fourth quarter of 2005 for the year ended december 31 2005 we repurchased approximately 1269000 shares of our common stock at an aggregate purchase price of 962609 we repurchased approximately 162000 shares of our common stock at an aggregate purchase price of 120818 during january 2006 which fully utilized all available share repurchase authorizations 

cash flows 

as shown in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended december 31 2005 our operating activities provided cash of 532772 cash was provided primarily by homebuilding operations and by the realization of a tax benefit of approximately 94000 from employee stockbased compensation activities these tax benefits were recorded directly to equity and reduced estimated tax payments during the year cash was also provided by a 53000 increase in customer deposits resulting primarily from the increase in backlog units in 2005 as compared to 2004 cash was used primarily to fund increases in homebuilding and mortgage loan inventory of approximately 202000 and 55000 respectively and to make deposits on fixed price purchase agreements with developers to acquire control of finished lots the increase in contract land deposits of approximately 196000 related to both payments for new fixed price purchase agreements and to scheduled payments under existing contracts upon achievement of development milestones we control approximately 105000 lots at december 31 2005 as compared to approximately 83500 lots at december 31 2004 

net cash used for investing activities was 22097 for the year ended december 31 2005 primarily as a result of approximately 19000 in property and equipment purchases throughout the period in addition on january 1 2005 we purchased substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of marc homebuilders inc a homebuilder in columbia south carolina for 7600 in cash see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements the acquired business operates under the rymarc trade name 

  net cash used for financing activities was 700514 for the year ended december 31 2005 primarily as a result of our ongoing common stock repurchase program offset by a net increase of approximately 249000 under our credit lines we repurchased approximately 1269000 shares of our common stock in 2005 for an aggregate purchase price of 962609 

at december 31 2005 the homebuilding and mortgage banking segments had restricted cash of 5135 and 1738 respectively which includes certain customer deposits mortgagor tax escrows insurance escrows completion escrows and other amounts collected at closing which relates to mortgage loans held for sale and to home sales 

we believe that cash generated from operations and borrowings available under our credit facilities and the public debt markets will be sufficient to satisfy near and longer term cash requirements for working capital and debt service in both our homebuilding and mortgage banking operations 

off balance sheet arrangements 

lot acquisition strategy 

we do not engage in the land development business instead we acquire finished building lots at market prices from various development entities under fixed price purchase agreements that require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the agreement the deposits required under the purchase agreements are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percentage typically ranging up to 10 of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots 

our lot acquisition strategy reduces the financial requirements and risks associated with direct land ownership and land development we may at our option choose for any reason and at any time not to perform under these purchase agreements by delivering notice of our intent not to acquire the finished lots under contract our sole legal obligation and economic loss for failure to perform under these purchase agreements is limited to the amount of the deposit pursuant to the liquidating damage provision contained within the purchase agreements we do not have any financial guarantees or completion obligations and with the exception of three specific performance contracts for 80 lots at an aggregate purchase price of approximately 7100 existing at december 31 2005 we do not guarantee specific performance under these purchase agreements 

at december 31 2005 we controlled approximately 105000 lots with an aggregate purchase price of approximately 10000000 by making or committing to make deposits of approximately 831000 in the form of cash and letters of credit our entire risk of loss pertaining to the aggregate 10000000 contractual commitment resulting from our nonperformance under the contracts is limited to the 831000 deposit amount of the 831000 deposit total approximately 600000 in cash and approximately 17000 in letters of credit have been issued as of december 31 2005 and 214000 will be paid subsequent to december 31 2005 assuming that contractual development milestones are met by the developers see contractual obligations section below please refer to note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our lot acquisition strategy in relation to our accounting under fin 46r consolidation of variable interest entities 

bonds and letters of credit 

we enter into bond or letter of credit arrangements with local municipalities government agencies or land developers to collateralize our obligations under various contracts we had 33325 of contingent obligations under such agreements as of december 31 2005 inclusive of the 17000 of lot acquisition deposits in the form of letters of credit discussed above we believe we will fulfill our obligations under the related contracts and do not anticipate any losses under these bonds or letters of credit 

  mortgage commitments and forward sales 

in the normal course of business our mortgage banking segment enters into contractual commitments to extend credit to buyers of singlefamily homes with fixed expiration dates the commitments become effective when the borrowers “lockin” a specified interest rate within time frames established by us all mortgagors are evaluated for credit worthiness prior to the extension of the commitment to mitigate the effect of the interest rate risk inherent in providing rate lock commitments to borrowers we enter into optional or mandatory delivery forward sale contracts to sell whole loans and mortgagebacked securities to brokerdealers the forward sale contracts lock in an interest rate and price for the sale of loans similar to the specific rate lock commitments classified as derivatives both the rate lock commitments to borrowers and the forward sale contracts to brokerdealers are undesignated derivatives and accordingly are marked to market through earnings at december 31 2005 there were contractual commitments to extend credit to borrowers aggregating approximately 140000 and open forward delivery sale contracts aggregating approximately 322000 

contractual obligations 

our fixed noncancelable obligations as of december 31 2005 were as follows 

 

 

 21 

  critical accounting policies 

  general 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods we continually evaluate the estimates we use to prepare the consolidated financial statements and update those estimates as necessary in general our estimates are based on historical experience on information from third party professionals and other various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances actual results could differ materially from those estimates made by management 

  variable interest entities 

revised financial interpretation no 46 “fin 46r” consolidation of variable interest entities  which was effective for us as of march 31 2004 requires the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity to consolidate that entity on its financial statements the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is the party that absorbs a majority of the variable interest entity’s expected losses receives a majority of the entity’s expected residual returns or both as a result of ownership contractual or other financial interests in the entity expected losses are the expected negative variability in the fair value of an entity’s net assets exclusive of its variable interests and expected residual returns are the expected positive variability in the fair value of an entity’s net assets exclusive of its variable interests 

forward contracts such as the fixed price purchase agreements utilized by us to acquire finished lot inventory are deemed to be variable interests under fin 46r therefore the development entities with which we enter fixed price purchase agreements are examined under fin 46r for possible consolidation by us including certain joint venture limited liability corporations “llc’s” utilized by us to acquire finished lots on a limited basis we have developed a methodology to determine whether we or conversely the owners of the applicable development entity are the primary beneficiary of a development entity the methodology used to evaluate our primary beneficiary status requires substantial management judgment and estimates these judgments and estimates involve assigning probabilities to various estimated cash flow possibilities relative to the development entity’s expected profits and losses and the cash flows associated with changes in the fair value of finished lots under contract although we believe that our accounting policy is designed to properly assess our primary beneficiary status relative to our involvement with the development entities from which we acquire finished lots changes to the probabilities and the cash flow possibilities used in our evaluation could produce widely different conclusions regarding whether we are or are not a development entity’s primary beneficiary possibly resulting in additional or fewer development entities being consolidated on our financial statements 

  homebuilding inventory 

the carrying value of inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market value cost of lots and completed and uncompleted housing units represent the accumulated actual cost of the units field construction supervisors’ salaries and related direct overhead expenses are included in inventory costs interest costs are not capitalized into inventory upon settlement the cost of the unit is expensed on a specific identification basis cost of manufacturing materials is determined on a firstin firstout basis recoverability and impairment if any is primarily evaluated by analyzing sales of comparable assets we believe that our accounting policy is designed to properly assess the carrying value of homebuilding inventory 

  contract land deposits 

we purchase finished lots under fixed price purchase agreements that require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the contract the deposits are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percentage of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots we maintain an allowance for losses on contract land deposits that we believe is sufficient to provide for losses in the existing 

  contract land deposit portfolio the allowance reflects our judgment of the present loss exposure at the end of the reporting period considering market and economic conditions sales absorption and profitability within specific communities and terms of the various contracts although we consider the allowance for losses on contract land deposits reflected on the december 31 2005 balance sheet to be adequate there can be no assurance that this allowance will prove to be adequate over time to cover losses due to unanticipated adverse changes in the economy or other events adversely affecting specific markets or the homebuilding industry 

  intangible assets 

reorganization value in excess of identifiable assets “excess reorganization value” goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are not subject to amortization under statement of financial accounting standards no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets “sfas 142” rather excess reorganization value goodwill and other intangible assets are subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fairvalue based test we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate that the remaining value of excess reorganization value goodwill and other intangible assets may not be recoverable we completed the annual assessment of impairment during the first quarter of 2005 and as of december 31 2005 we believe that excess reorganization value goodwill and other intangible assets were not impaired this conclusion is based on management’s judgment considering such factors as our history of operating success our wellrecognized brand names and the significant positions held in the markets in which we operate however changes in strategy or adverse changes in market conditions could impact this judgment and require an impairment loss to be recognized for the amount that the carrying value of excess reorganization value goodwill andor other intangible assets exceeds their fair value 

  warranty  product liability accruals 

warranty and product liability accruals are established to provide for estimated future costs as a result of construction and product defects product recalls and litigation incidental to our business liability estimates are determined based on our judgment considering such factors as historical experience the likely current cost of corrective action manufacturers’ and subcontractors’ participation in sharing the cost of corrective action consultations with third party experts such as engineers and discussions with our general counsel and other outside counsel retained to handle specific product liability cases although we consider the warranty and product liability accrual reflected on the december 31 2005 balance sheet see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements to be adequate there can be no assurance that this accrual will prove to be adequate over time to cover losses due to increased costs for material and labor the inability or refusal of manufacturers or subcontractors to financially participate in corrective action unanticipated adverse legal settlements or other unanticipated changes to the assumptions used to estimate the warranty and product liability accrual 

impact of inflation changing prices and economic conditions 

see risk factors included in item 1a herein 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates our market risk arises from interest rate risk inherent in our financial instruments interest rate risk is the possibility that changes in interest rates will cause unfavorable changes in net income or in the value of interest ratesensitive assets liabilities and commitments lower interest rates tend to increase demand for mortgage loans for home purchasers while higher interest rates make it more difficult for potential borrowers to purchase residential properties and to qualify for mortgage loans we have no market rate sensitive instruments held for speculative or trading purposes 

our mortgage banking segment is exposed to interest rate risk as it relates to its lending activities the mortgage banking segment originates mortgage loans which are either sold through optional or mandatory forward delivery contracts into the secondary markets all of the mortgage banking segment’s loan portfolio is held for sale and subject to forward sale commitments nvrm also sells substantially all of its mortgage servicing rights on a servicing released basis 

  our homebuilding segment generates operating liquidity and acquires capital assets through fixedrate and variablerate debt the homebuilding segment’s primary debt is a variablerate working capital revolving credit facility that currently provides for unsecured borrowings up to 400000 subject to certain borrowing base limitations the facility expires in december 2010 and outstanding amounts bear interest at either i the prime rate plus an applicable margin as defined within the facility based on nvr’s credit rating andor debt to capital ratio or ii libor plus applicable margin as defined above the weightedaverage interest rates for the amounts outstanding under the facility were 59 and 40 for 2005 and 2004 respectively 

nvrm generates operating liquidity primarily through the mortgage warehouse facility which had a borrowing limit of 225000 at december 31 2005 the available borrowing limit was reduced to 175000 on january 15 2006 the mortgage warehouse facility is used to fund its mortgage origination activities the interest rate under the mortgage warehouse facility is either i libor plus 1125 or ii 1125 to the extent that nvrm provides compensating balances the weightedaverage interest rate for amounts outstanding under the mortgage warehouse facility was 44 during 2005 

the following table represents the contractual balances of our onbalance sheet financial instruments in dollars at the expected maturity dates as well as the fair values of those onbalance sheet financial instruments at december 31 2005 the expected maturity categories take into consideration the actual and anticipated amortization of principal and does not take into consideration the reinvestment of cash or the refinancing of existing indebtedness because we sell all of the mortgage loans we originate into the secondary markets we have made the assumption that the portfolio of mortgage loans held for sale will mature in the first year consequently outstanding warehouse borrowings and repurchase facilities are also assumed to mature in the first year

 item 1 business 

  

general 

  

nvr inc “nvr” was formed in 1980 as nvhomes inc nvr operates in two business segments homebuilding and mortgage banking nvr conducts its homebuilding activities directly and its mortgage banking operations primarily through a wholly owned subsidiary nvr mortgage finance inc “nvrm” unless the context otherwise requires references to “nvr” “we” “us” or “our” include nvr and its subsidiaries 

  

we are one of the largest homebuilders in the united states and in the washington dc and baltimore md metropolitan areas while we operate in multiple locations in eleven states primarily in the eastern part of the united states approximately 42 of our home settlements in 2004 occurred in the washington dc and baltimore md metropolitan areas which accounted for 54 of our 2004 homebuilding revenues our homebuilding operations include the construction and sale of singlefamily detached homes townhomes and condominium buildings under three trade names ryan homes nvhomes and fox ridge homes the ryan homes and fox ridge homes products are moderately priced and marketed primarily to firsttime homeowners and firsttime moveup buyers the ryan homes product is built in eighteen metropolitan areas located in maryland virginia west virginia pennsylvania new york north carolina south carolina ohio new jersey and delaware the fox ridge homes product is built solely in the nashville tn metropolitan area the nvhomes product is marketed primarily to moveup and upscale buyers and is built in the washington dc baltimore md and philadelphia pa metropolitan areas in 2004 our average price of a unit settled was approximately 332200 

  

we do not engage in the land development business instead we acquire finished building lots at market prices from various development entities under fixedprice purchase agreements that require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the agreement the deposits required under the purchase agreements are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percentage typically ranging up to 10 of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots 

  

our lot acquisition strategy reduces the financial requirements and risks associated with direct land ownership and land development we may at our option choose for any reason and at any time not to perform under these purchase agreements by delivering notice of our intent not to acquire the finished lots under contract our sole legal obligation and economic loss for failure to perform under these purchase agreements is limited to the amount of the deposit pursuant to the liquidating damage provision contained within the purchase agreements we do not have any financial guarantees or completion obligations and with the exception of one specific performance contract for 20 lots existing at december 31 2004 do not guarantee specific performance under these purchase agreements we generally seek to maintain control over a supply of lots believed to be suitable to meet our sales objectives for the next 24 to 36 months 

  

in addition to building and selling homes we provide a number of mortgagerelated services through our mortgage banking operations which operate in 11 states through office locations in each of our homebuilding markets nvrm originates mortgage loans exclusively for our homebuyers nvrm generates revenues primarily from origination fees gains on sales of loans and title fees nvrm sells substantially all of the mortgage loans it closes into the secondary markets on a servicing released basis 

  

segment information for our homebuilding and mortgage banking businesses is included in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

homebuilding 

  

products 

  

we offer singlefamily detached homes townhomes and condominium buildings with many different basic home designs these home designs have a variety of elevations and numerous other options our homes combine traditional or colonial exterior designs with contemporary interior designs and amenities generally include two to four bedrooms and range from approximately 1000 to 7300 square feet and are priced from approximately 90000 to 1700000 

  

markets 

  

we operate in the following geographic regions 

  

   

further discussion of settlements new orders and backlog activity by region for each of the last three years can be found in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations see item 7 of this report 

  

backlog 

  

backlog totaled 7372 units and approximately 29 billion at december 31 2004 compared to backlog of 6890 units and approximately 23 billion at december 31 2003 based on historical trends we anticipate that approximately 15 of the units in backlog at december 31 2004 will cancel prior to settlement the remaining 85 of the units are expected to settle in 2005 

  

construction 

  

we utilize independent subcontractors under fixedprice contracts to perform construction work on our homes the subcontractors’ work is performed under the supervision of our employees who monitor quality control we use many independent subcontractors in our various markets and we are not dependent on any single subcontractor or on a small number of subcontractors 

  

land development 

  

we are not in the land development business we purchase finished lots from various land developers under fixedprice purchase agreements that require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the agreement the deposits required under the purchase agreements are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percentage typically ranging up to 10 of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots we are not dependent on any single developer or on a small number of developers 

  

sales and marketing 

  

our preferred marketing method is for customers to visit a furnished model home featuring many builtin options and a landscaped lot the garages of these model homes are usually converted into temporary sales centers where alternative facades and floor plans are displayed and designs for other models are available for review sales representatives are compensated predominantly on a commission basis 

  

regulation 

  

nvr and its subcontractors must comply with various federal state and local zoning building environmental advertising and consumer credit statutes rules and regulations as well as other regulations and requirements in connection with our construction and sales activities all of these regulations have increased the cost to produce and market our products counties and cities in which we build homes have at times declared moratoriums on the issuance of building permits and imposed other restrictions in the areas in which sewage treatment facilities and other public facilities do not reach minimum standards to date restrictive zoning laws and the imposition of moratoriums have not had a material adverse effect on our construction activities 

  

competition and market factors 

  

the housing industry is highly competitive we compete with numerous homebuilders of varying size ranging from local to national in scope some of which have greater financial resources than we do we also face competition from the home resale market our homebuilding operations compete primarily on the basis of price location design quality service and reputation we historically have been one of the market leaders in each of the markets where we build homes 

  

the housing industry is cyclical and is affected by consumer confidence levels prevailing economic conditions and interest rates other factors that affect the housing industry and the demand for new homes include the availability and increases in the cost of land labor and materials changes in consumer preferences demographic trends and the availability of mortgage finance programs 

  

we are dependent upon building material suppliers for a continuous flow of raw materials whenever possible we utilize standard products available from multiple sources in the past such raw materials have been generally available to us in adequate supply 

  

mortgage banking 

  

we provide a number of mortgage related services to our homebuilding customers through our mortgage banking operations our mortgage banking operations also include separate subsidiaries that broker title insurance and perform title searches in connection with mortgage loan closings for which they receive commissions and fees because nvrm originates mortgage loans predominately for our homebuilding customers nvrm is dependent on our homebuilding segment in 2004 nvrm closed approximately 10400 loans with an aggregate principal amount of approximately 27 billion 

  

nvrm sells substantially all of the mortgage loans it closes to investors in the secondary markets on a servicing released basis nvrm is an approved sellerservicer for fnma gnma fhlmc va and fha mortgage loans 

  

competition and market factors 

  

nvrm operates through 16 branches in 11 states nvrm’s main competition comes from national regional and local mortgage bankers mortgage brokers thrifts and banks in each of these markets nvrm competes primarily on the basis of customer service variety of products offered interest rates offered prices of ancillary services and relative financing availability and costs 

  

regulation 

  

nvrm is an approved sellerservicer of fnma gnma fhlmc fha and va mortgage loans and is subject to all of those agencies’ rules and regulations these rules and regulations restrict certain activities of nvrm nvrm is currently eligible and expects to remain eligible to participate in such programs in addition nvrm is subject to regulation at the state and federal level with respect to specific origination selling and servicing practices 

  

pipeline 

  

nvrm’s mortgage loans in process that have not closed “pipeline” at december 31 2004 and 2003 had an aggregate principal balance of 19 billion and 15 billion respectively nvrm anticipates that approximately 25 of its pipeline at december 31 2004 will cancel prior to closing the remaining 75 of the pipeline is expected to close in 2005 

  

employees 

  

at december 31 2004 we employed 4407 fulltime persons of whom 1746 were officers and management personnel 232 were technical and construction personnel 847 were sales personnel 672 were administrative personnel and 910 were engaged in various other service and labor activities none of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement and we have never experienced a work stoppage we believe that our employee relations are good

 risk factors 

  

our business is affected by the risks generally incident to the residential construction business including but not limited to 

  

   

   

   

   

interest rate movements inflation and other economic factors can negatively impact our business 

  

high rates of inflation generally affect the homebuilding industry adversely because of their adverse impact on interest rates high interest rates not only increase the cost of borrowed funds to homebuilders but also have a significant effect on housing demand and on the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective purchasers we are also subject to potential volatility in the price of commodities that impact costs of materials used in our homebuilding business increases in prevailing interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations 

  

our financial results also are affected by the risks generally incident to our mortgage banking business including interest rate levels the impact of government regulation on mortgage loan originations and servicing and the need to issue forward commitments to fund and sell mortgage loans our homebuilding customers accounted for almost all of our mortgage banking business in 2004 the volume of our continuing homebuilding operations therefore affects our mortgage banking business 

  

our mortgage banking business also is affected by interest rate fluctuations we also may experience marketing losses resulting from daily increases in interest rates to the extent we are unable to match interest rates and amounts on loans we have committed to originate with forward commitments from third parties to purchase such loans increases in interest rates may have a material adverse effect on our mortgage banking revenue profitability stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations 

  

these factors and thus the homebuilding business have tended to be cyclical in nature any downturn in the national economy or the local economies of the markets in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations in particular approximately 42 of our home settlements during 2004 occurred in the washington dc and baltimore md metropolitan areas which accounted for 54 of our 2004 homebuilding revenues thus we are dependent to a significant extent on the economy and demand for housing in those areas 

  

our inability to secure and control an adequate inventory of lots could adversely impact our operations 

  

the results of our homebuilding operations are dependent upon our continuing ability to control an adequate number of homebuilding lots in desirable locations there can be no assurance that an adequate supply of building lots will continue to be available to us on terms similar to those available in the past or that we will not be required to devote a greater amount of capital to controlling building lots than we have historically an insufficient supply of building lots in one or more of our markets or our inability to purchase or finance building lots on reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations 

  

inventory risk can be substantial for homebuilders the market value of building lots and housing inventories can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing market conditions in addition inventory carrying costs can be significant and can result in losses in a poorly performing project or market we must in the ordinary course of our business continuously seek and make acquisitions of lots for expansion into new markets as well as for replacement and expansion within our current markets in the event of significant changes in economic or market conditions we may dispose of certain subdivision inventories on a bulk or other basis which may result in a loss which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations 

  

our current indebtedness may impact our future operations and our ability to access necessary financing 

  

our homebuilding operations are dependent in part on the availability and cost of working capital financing and may be adversely affected by a shortage or an increase in the cost of such financing if we require working capital greater than that provided by our operations and our credit facility we may be required to seek to increase the amount available under the facility or to obtain alternative financing no assurance can be given that additional or replacement financing will be available on terms that are favorable or acceptable if we are at any time unsuccessful in obtaining sufficient capital to fund our planned homebuilding expenditures we may experience a substantial delay in the completion of any homes then under construction any delay could result in cost increases and could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

  

our existing indebtedness contains financial and other restrictive covenants and any future indebtedness may also contain covenants these covenants include limitations on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness pay cash dividends and make distributions make loans and investments enter into transactions with affiliates effect certain asset sales incur certain liens merge or consolidate with any other person or transfer all or substantially all of our properties and assets substantial losses by us or other action or inaction by us or our subsidiaries could result in the violation of one or more of these covenants which could result in decreased liquidity or a default on our indebtedness thereby having a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations 

  

our mortgage banking operations are dependent on the availability cost and other terms of mortgage warehouse financing and may be adversely affected by any shortage or increased cost of such financing no assurance can be given that any additional or replacement financing will be available on terms that are favorable or acceptable our mortgage banking operations are also dependent upon the securitization market for mortgagebacked securities and could be materially adversely affected by any fluctuation or downturn in such market 

  

government regulations and environmental matters can negatively affect our operations 

  

we are subject to various local state and federal statutes ordinances rules and regulations concerning zoning building design construction and similar matters including local regulations that impose restrictive zoning and density requirements in order to limit the number of homes that can eventually be built within the boundaries of a particular area we have from time to time been subject to and may also be subject in the future to periodic delays in our homebuilding projects due to building moratoriums in the areas in which we operate changes in regulations that restrict homebuilding activities in one or more of our principal markets could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations 

  

we are also subject to a variety of local state and federal statutes ordinances rules and regulations concerning the protection of health and the environment we are subject to a variety of environmental conditions that can affect our business and our homebuilding projects the particular environmental laws that apply to any given homebuilding site vary greatly according to the location and environmental condition of the site and the present and former uses of the site and adjoining properties environmental laws and conditions may result in delays cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs or prohibit or severely restrict homebuilding activity in certain environmentally sensitive regions or areas thereby adversely affecting our sales profitability stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations 

  

we are an approved sellerservicer of fnma gnma fhlmc fha and va mortgage loans and are subject to all of those agencies’ rules and regulations any significant impairment of our eligibility to sellservice these loans could have a material adverse impact on our mortgage operations in addition we are subject to regulation at the state and federal level with respect to specific origination selling and servicing practices adverse changes in governmental regulation may have a negative impact on our mortgage loan origination business 

  

we face competition in our housing and mortgage banking operations 

  

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive we compete with numerous homebuilders of varying size ranging from local to national in scope some of whom have greater financial resources than we do we face competition 

  

   

   

   

our homebuilding operations compete primarily on the basis of price location design quality service and reputation historically we have been one of the leading homebuilders in each of the markets where we operate 

  

the mortgage banking industry is also competitive our main competition comes from national regional and local mortgage bankers thrifts banks and mortgage brokers in each of these markets our mortgage banking operations compete primarily on the basis of customer service variety of products offered interest rates offered prices of ancillary services and relative financing availability and costs 

  

there can be no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully in our homebuilding or mortgage banking operations an inability to effectively compete may have an adverse impact on our sales profitability stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations 

  

a shortage of building materials or labor may adversely impact our operations 

  

the homebuilding business has from time to time experienced building material and labor shortages including shortages in insulation drywall certain carpentry work and concrete as well as fluctuating lumber prices and supply in addition high employment levels and strong construction market conditions could restrict the labor force available to our subcontractors and us in one or more of our markets significant increases in costs resulting from these shortages or delays in construction of homes could have a material adverse effect upon our sales profitability stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations 

  

weatherrelated and other events beyond our control may adversely impact our operations 

  

extreme weather or other events such as hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes forest fires floods terrorist attacks or war may affect our markets our operations and our profitability these events may impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or subcontractors causing us material increases in costs or delays in construction of homes which could have a material adverse effect upon our sales profitability stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations

 item 5 market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities 

  

our shares of common stock are listed and principally traded on the american stock exchange “amex” the following table sets forth the high and low closing sales prices per share for each fiscal quarter during the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 

  

   

as of the close of business on february 18 2005 there were 508 shareholders of record 

  

we did not pay any cash dividends on our shares of common stock during the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 in addition we do not expect to pay a cash dividend in the foreseeable future as we continue with our objective of increasing shareholder value by using earnings to fund continued growth in our homebuilding and mortgage banking operations we may from time to time repurchase shares of our common stock to also further that objective our bank indebtedness contains certain restrictive covenants which limit our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock as of december 31 2004 the most restrictive of these bank provisions would have limited us to paying a maximum of approximately 250 million in cash dividends 

  

on may 3 2004 the “may authorization” and december 16 2004 the “december authorization” we publicly announced the board of director’s approval for us to purchase up to an aggregate of 200 million and 400 million respectively of our common stock in one or more open market andor privately negotiated transactions neither the may authorization nor the december authorization has an expiration date as of december 31 2004 no repurchases were made under the december authorization the following table provides information regarding common stock repurchases for the quarter ended december 31 2004 all of which were made under the may authorization 

  

   




 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in thousands except per share data 

  

results of operations for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 

  

overview 

  

our primary business is the construction and sale of singlefamily detached homes townhomes and condominium buildings to fully serve our homebuilding customers we also operate a mortgage banking and title services business we operate in the following markets 

  

   

we believe we operate our business with a conservative operating strategy we do not engage in land development and primarily construct homes on a presold basis this strategy allows us to maximize 

  

inventory turnover which enables us to minimize market risk and to operate with less capital thereby enhancing rates of return on equity and total capital in addition we focus on obtaining and maintaining a leading market position in each market we serve this strategy allows us to gain valuable efficiencies and competitive advantages in our markets which we believe contributes to minimizing the adverse effects of regional economic cycles and provides growth opportunities within these markets 

  

because we are not active in the land development business our continued success is contingent upon our ability to control an adequate supply of finished lots on which to build and on our developers’ ability to deliver finished lots to timely meet the sales demands of our customers we acquire finished building lots at market prices from various development entities under fixedprice purchase agreements “purchase agreements” these purchase agreements require deposits in the form of cash or letters of credit that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the purchase agreement however this lot acquisition strategy reduces the financial requirements and risks associated with direct land ownership and development as of december 31 2004 we controlled approximately 83500 lots with deposits in cash and letters of credit totaling approximately 404000 and 13000 respectively we also controlled approximately 950 lots through investments in joint venture limited liability corporations 

  

consolidated revenues and net income for 2004 increased 17 and 25 respectively from 2003 the increase in net income coupled with our continuing share repurchase program resulted in a 37 increase in diluted earnings per share in 2004 compared to 2003 

  

homebuilding segment 

  

the following tables summarizes homebuilding settlements new orders and backlog activity by region for each of the last three years 

  

   

the following table summarizes the results of operations for each of the last three years for our homebuilding segment 

  

   

homebuilding segment 

  

homebuilding revenues for 2004 increased 18 from 2003 primarily as a result of a 12 increase in the average settlement price to 3322 in 2004 from 2979 in 2003 and to an increase of 6 in the number of homes settled to 12749 in 2004 from 12050 in 2003 the increase in average settlement prices is primarily attributable to a 9 higher average price of homes in backlog entering 2004 as compared to 2003 and to a 16 increase in the average price of homes sold during the first six months of 2004 as compared to the same period in 2003 the increase in the number of homes settled is primarily attributable to an 8 higher backlog at the beginning of 2004 as compared to the beginning of 2003 

  

homebuilding revenues for 2003 increased 18 as compared to revenues in 2002 the increase in revenues resulted primarily from an 11 increase in the average settlement price to 2979 in 2003 from 2685 in 2002 and to an increase of 6 in the number of homes settled to 12050 in 2003 from 11368 in 2002 the increase in average settlement prices is primarily attributable to favorable market conditions resulting in increased sales prices in a majority of nvr’s markets the increase in the number of homes settled is primarily attributable to a 14 higher backlog at the beginning of 2003 as compared to the beginning of 2002 and a 6 increase in new orders during the first six months of 2003 as compared to the same period in 2002 

  

the number of new orders for 2004 increased 5 from 2003 while the value of new orders for 2004 increased 22 to 4817780 from 3950413 in 2003 the increase in the number of new orders was attributable to an overall increase in the average number of active communities to 450 in 2004 as compared to 433 in 2003 increases year over year in new orders in the washington north and south regions were offset partially by a 9 decrease in new orders for the baltimore region this decrease resulted primarily from a 7 decrease in the average number of active communities in the baltimore region year over year attributable primarily to development delays the 22 increase in the value of new orders is primarily attributable to the aforementioned increase in the number of new orders and strong housing demand which provided us the opportunity to raise selling prices resulting in a 16 increase in the average selling price in 2004 as compared to 2003 

  

new orders for the full year ended 2003 increased 3 to 12583 units from 12167 units in 2002 the value of new orders increased 13 to 3950413 in 2003 from 3501793 in 2002 the increase in new orders occurred predominately in the north region as a result of a 5 increase in the average number of active communities within this region the decrease in new orders in the washington region was primarily due to a 2 reduction in the average number of active communities within that region 

  

the increase in gross profit margins in 2004 from 2003 is primarily attributable to favorable market conditions which allowed us to increase sales prices in a majority of our markets leading to the aforementioned 12 increase in average settlement prices year over year these increases were partially offset by higher land lumber and other commodity prices in 2004 as compared to 2003 gross profit margins in future periods may be negatively impacted by the trend of higher land lumber and other commodity prices if we are unable to pass these increases through to our homebuyers on new orders gross profit margins for 2003 increased to 247 compared to 237 for 2002 the increase in profit margins was attributable to the favorable market conditions allowing nvr to raise sales prices on new orders in a majority of the markets nvr serves 

  

selling general and administrative expenses “sga” for 2004 increased 12 from 2003 but as a percentage of revenues decreased to 61 in 2004 from 64 in 2003 the increase in sga costs is primarily attributable to increased personnel costs and selling and marketing costs of approximately 11500 and 10400 respectively due to our continued growth strategy sga expenses for 2003 increased approximately 3 from 2002 and as a percentage of revenues decreased to approximately 64 in 2003 from 74 in 2002 the increase in sga costs in 2003 is primarily attributable to increases in personnel costs and selling and marketing costs of approximately 13000 and 8000 respectively to facilitate continued growth objectives in existing markets and to an approximate 9000 increase in other general and administrative costs incidental to the aforementioned increase in revenues these increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately 24000 in 2003 from 2002 related to the termination of certain management incentive compensation plans at the end of 2002 

  

backlog units and dollars were 7372 and 2906041 respectively at december 31 2004 compared to backlog units of 6890 and dollars of 2323703 at december 31 2003 the increase in backlog units is due primarily to a 6 increase in the number of new orders for the sixmonth period ended december 31 2004 as compared to the same period ended december 31 2003 the 25 increase in backlog dollars is attributable to the 7 increase in backlog units and a 16 increase in the average price of new orders for the sixmonth period ended december 31 2004 as compared to the same period in 2003 backlog units and dollars were 6890 and 2323703 respectively at december 31 2003 compared to backlog units of 6357 and dollars of 1962115 at december 31 2002 the increase in backlog units is due primarily to a 14 higher backlog at the beginning of 2003 as compared to the beginning of 2002 the 18 increase in backlog dollars is attributable to an 8 increase in backlog units and a 12 increase in the average price of new orders for the six months ended december 31 2003 as compared to the same period in 2002 

  

mortgage banking segment 

  

nvr conducts its mortgage banking activity through nvr mortgage finance inc “nvrm” a wholly owned subsidiary nvrm focuses almost exclusively on serving the homebuilding segment’s customer base following is a table of financial and statistical data for the three years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 

  

   

loan closing volume for the year ended december 31 2004 increased 14 from 2003 the 2004 increase is primarily attributable to a 12 increase in the average loan amount and a year over year 2 increase in the number of units closed the increase in the average loan amount reflects the aforementioned increase in the homebuilding segment’s average selling prices the unit increase for the year ended december 31 2004 reflects an increase in the number of settlements by the homebuilding segment and a slight increase in the percentage of the number of loans closed for nvr’s homebuyers who obtain a mortgage to purchase the home “capture rate” 

  

segment income for the year ended december 31 2004 decreased approximately 6900 from 2003 the decrease is primarily due to a product mix shift during 2004 from fixed rate mortgages to adjustable rate mortgages and brokered mortgages both of which are generally less profitable products than fixed rate mortgages the decrease is also due to higher costs incurred of approximately 3400 related to the contractual repayment of loan sale income to investors for loans that were paid in full within a set number of days following the sale of the loan the decreases due to the product mix shift and contractual repayments was partially offset by the higher 2004 loan volume general and administrative expenses have also increased during the 2004 year compared to 2003 by approximately 1800 which is largely due to a 15 increase in the total number of nvrm employees in 2004 versus 2003 the increased staffing level is to position nvrm for future growth and to increase the capture rate 

  

mortgage loans held for sale increased approximately 42000 at december 31 2004 compared to december 31 2003 nvrm’s product mix shift into adjustable rate mortgages which are delivered into sales channels on a whole loan basis has lengthened the average sale and funding cycle from thirdparty investors even with the lengthened sale and funding cycle mortgage loans held for sale are typically sold to thirdparty investors in less than 30 days from date of closing 

  

loan closing volume for the year ended december 31 2003 increased 10 over 2002 the 2003 increase compared to 2002 is solely attributable to a 10 increase in the average loan amount due to the homebuilding segment’s higher average selling prices the number of units closed was flat in 2003 compared to 2002 

  

segment income for the year ended december 31 2003 increased approximately 11100 over 2002 the 2003 increase is primarily due to an increase in mortgage banking fees attributable to the aforementioned 10 increase in closed loan volume increased secondary marketing gains and higher revenues per loan secondary marketing gains for 2003 increased approximately 2000 over 2002 average revenues per loan including origination fees ancillary fees and discount points for 2003 increased by approximately 7 

  

seasonality 

  

overall we do not experience material seasonal fluctuations in sales settlements or loan closings 

  

effective tax rate 

  

our consolidated effective tax rates were 400 397 and 382 in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively the lower effective tax rate in 2002 was primarily due to the amendment of a longterm cash incentive plan requiring executive officers to defer receipt of payments due under the plan until separation of service with nvr the effect of this amendment converted compensation expensed prior to january 1 2002 from a permanent tax difference to a temporary tax difference producing an approximate 7800 deferred tax benefit 

  

recent accounting pronouncements 

  

in november 2004 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued statement of financial accounting standards no 151 inventory cost – an amendment of arb no 43 chapter 4 “sfas 151” sfas 151 clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense freight handling costs and wasted material requiring all such costs to be recognized as currentperiod charges sfas 151 is effective for fiscal years beginning after june 15 2005 we do not expect that the adoption of sfas 151 will have material impact on our financial position and results of operations 

  

in december 2004 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payments  “sfas 123r” sfas 123r is a revision of sfas 123 and supersedes apb no 25 sfas 123r requires that the cost resulting from all sharebased payment transactions be recognized 

  

in the financial statements and establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for sharebased payment arrangements sfas 123r is effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june 15 2005 and applies to all awards granted modified repurchased or cancelled after the effective date and all outstanding portions of awards granted prior to the effective date which are unvested as the effective date of the pronouncement entities may adopt the provisions of sfas 123r using either the modified prospective or modified retrospective application under the modified prospective method compensation cost is recognized on or after the required effective date for the portion of outstanding awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered based on the grantdate fair value of those awards calculated under sfas 123 for either recognition or pro forma disclosure for periods before the required effective date the modified retrospective application may be applied to either a all prior years for which sfas 123 was effective or b only to prior interim periods in the year of initial adoption on a basis consistent with the pro forma disclosures required for those periods by sfas 123 sfas 123r becomes effective for us beginning in the third quarter of 2005 we are currently evaluating the requirements of sfas 123r and although we expect the effect of adopting sfas 123r to be consistent with our pro forma financial results presented in our disclosure currently required by sfas 123 the granting of additional equity awards prior to the adoption of sfas 123r could materially increase the compensation expense recognized under sfas 123r 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

lines of credit and notes payable 

  

our homebuilding segment generally provides for its working capital cash requirements using cash generated from operations and a shortterm unsecured working capital revolving credit facility the “facility” the facility provides for borrowings of up to 150000 subject to certain borrowing base limitations and expires in august 2007 the facility bears interest at a variable rate based on the type of borrowing and other criteria set forth in the facility the weighted average interest rate for borrowings outstanding during 2004 was 40 up to 50000 of the facility is currently available for issuance in the form of letters of credit of which 21794 was outstanding at december 31 2004 there were no direct borrowings outstanding under the facility as of december 31 2004 at december 31 2004 there were no borrowing base limitations reducing the amount available to us for borrowings 

  

nvr’s mortgage banking segment provides for its mortgage origination and other operating activities using cash generated from operations as well as various shortterm credit facilities nvrm has available an annually renewable mortgage warehouse facility the “revolving credit agreement” with an aggregate borrowing limit of 175000 to fund its mortgage origination activities under which 9726 was outstanding at december 31 2004 as of december 31 2004 borrowing base limitations reduced the amount available to nvrm for borrowings to approximately 131000 the revolving credit agreement expires in august 2005 the interest rate under the revolving credit agreement is either i the london interbank offering rate “libor” plus 125 or ii 125 to the extent that nvrm provides compensating balances the weighted average interest rate for amounts outstanding under the revolving credit agreement was 19 during 2004 nvrm’s mortgage warehouse facility limits the ability of nvrm to transfer funds to nvr in the form of dividends loans or advances in addition nvrm is required to maintain a minimum net worth of 14000 nvrm also currently has available an aggregate of 50000 of borrowing capacity in an uncommitted gestation and repurchase agreement amounts outstanding under the uncommitted gestation and repurchase agreement accrue interest at various rates tied to the libor rate and are collateralized by gestation mortgagebacked securities and whole loans there were no borrowings under this uncommitted facility during 2004 

  

on january 20 1998 we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission “sec” for the issuance of up to 400000 of debt securities the “1998 shelf registration” the 1998 shelf registration statement was declared effective on february 27 1998 and provides that securities may be offered from time to time in one or more series and in the form of senior or subordinated debt 

  

on june 17 2003 we completed an offering at par for 200000 of 5 senior notes due 2010 the 

  

“notes” under the 1998 shelf registration the offering of the notes resulted in aggregate net proceeds of approximately 199400 after deducting offering expenses the notes mature on june 15 2010 and bear interest at 5 payable semiannually in arrears on june 15 and december 15 commencing on december 15 2003 the notes are general unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness and indebtedness under our existing credit facility the notes are senior in right of payment to any future subordinated indebtedness that we may incur we may redeem the notes in whole or in part at any time upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days notice at a redemption price equal to the greater of a 100 of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed or b the discounted present value of the remaining scheduled payments of the notes to be redeemed plus in each case accrued and unpaid interest 

  

on july 14 2003 we used approximately 120700 of the proceeds received from the sale of the notes to redeem all of the 115000 outstanding 8 senior notes due 2005 at a price of 104 of the principal amount outstanding including the payment of accrued interest the redemption resulted in a charge to pretax homebuilding income of 8503 

  

on may 27 2004 we filed a shelf registration statement the “2004 shelf registration” with the sec to register up to 1000000 for future offer and sale of debt securities common shares preferred shares depositary shares representing preferred shares and warrants the sec declared the 2004 shelf registration effective on june 15 2004 nvr expects to use the proceeds received from future offerings issued under the 2004 shelf registration for general corporate purposes in addition we have 55000 remaining available for issuance under the 1998 shelf registration this discussion of our shelf registration capacity does not constitute an offer of any securities for sale 

  

equity repurchases 

  

in addition to funding growth in our homebuilding and mortgage banking operations we historically have used a substantial portion of our excess liquidity to repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock in open market and privately negotiated transactions this ongoing repurchase activity is conducted pursuant to publicly announced board authorizations and is typically executed in accordance with the safeharbor provisions of rule 10b18 of the 1933 securities act the repurchase program assists us in accomplishing our primary objective creating increases in shareholder value see part ii item 5 of the form 10k for disclosure of amounts repurchased during the fourth quarter of 2004 for the year ended december 31 2004 we repurchased approximately 675000 shares of our common stock at an aggregate purchase price of 307603 

  

cash flows 

  

as shown in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended december 31 2004 our operating activities provided cash of 463928 cash was provided primarily by homebuilding operations and by the realization of a tax benefit of 92661 from employee stockbased compensation activities primarily employee stock option exercises these tax benefits were recorded directly to equity and reduced estimated tax payments during the year cash was also provided by a 46830 increase in customer deposits resulting primarily from the increase in backlog units in 2004 as compared to 2003 cash was used primarily to fund increases in homebuilding inventory of 64767 and to make deposits on fixedprice purchase agreements with developers to acquire control of finished lots the increase in contract land deposits of 118680 resulted in an increase in the number of lots under control to approximately 83500 lots at december 31 2004 from approximately 70000 lots at december 31 2003 

  

net cash provided by investing activities was 3581 for the year ended december 31 2004 primarily due to principal payments received on mortgage loans held for sale partially offset by capital spending 

  

net cash used for financing activities was 332363 for the year ended december 31 2004 primarily as a result of our ongoing common stock repurchase program we repurchased approximately 675000 shares of our common stock in 2004 for an aggregate purchase price of 307603 

  

at december 31 2004 the homebuilding and mortgage banking segments had restricted cash of 19473 and 4115 respectively which includes certain customer deposits mortgagor tax escrows insurance escrows completion escrows and other amounts collected at closing which relates to mortgage loans held for sale and to home sales 

  

we believe that internally generated cash and borrowings available under our credit facilities and the public debt markets will be sufficient to satisfy near and longer term cash requirements for working capital and debt service in both our homebuilding and mortgage banking operations 

  

off –balance sheet arrangements 

  

lot acquisition strategy 

  

we do not engage in the land development business instead we acquire finished building lots at market prices from various development entities under fixedprice purchase agreements that require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the agreement the deposits required under the purchase agreements are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percentage typically ranging up to 10 of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots 

  

our lot acquisition strategy reduces the financial requirements and risks associated with direct land ownership and land development we may at our option choose for any reason and at any time not to perform under these purchase agreements by delivering notice of our intent not to acquire the finished lots under contract our sole legal obligation and economic loss for failure to perform under these purchase agreements is limited to the amount of the deposit pursuant to the liquidating damage provision contained within the purchase agreements we do not have any financial guarantees or completion obligations and with the exception of one specific performance contract for 20 lots existing at december 31 2004 do not guarantee specific performance under these purchase agreements 

  

at december 31 2004 we controlled approximately 83500 lots with an aggregate purchase price of approximately 7500000 by making or committing to make deposits of approximately 551000 in the form of cash and letters of credit our entire risk of loss pertaining to the aggregate 7500000 contractual commitment resulting from our nonperformance under the contracts is limited to the 551000 deposit amount of the 551000 deposit total approximately 404000 in cash and approximately 13000 in letters of credit have been issued as of december 31 2004 and 134000 will be paid subsequent to december 31 2004 assuming that contractual development milestones are met by the developers see contractual obligations section below 

  

bonds and letters of credit 

  

we enter into bond or letter of credit arrangements with local municipalities government agencies or land developers to collateralize our obligations under various contracts we had 27791 of contingent obligations under such agreements as of december 31 2004 inclusive of the 13000 of lot acquisition deposits discussed above we believe we will fulfill our obligations under the related contracts and do not anticipate any losses under these bonds or letters of credit 

  

mortgage commitments and forward sales 

  

in the normal course of business our mortgage banking segment enters into contractual commitments to extend credit to buyers of singlefamily homes with fixed expiration dates the commitments become effective when the borrowers “lockin” a specified interest rate within time frames established by us all mortgagors are evaluated for credit worthiness prior to the extension of the commitment to mitigate the effect of the interest rate risk inherent in providing rate lock commitments to borrowers we enter into optional or mandatory delivery forward sale contracts to sell whole loans and mortgagebacked securities to brokerdealers the forward sale contracts lock in an interest rate and price for the sale of loans similar to the specific rate lock commitments classified as derivatives both the rate lock commitments to borrowers and the forward sale contracts to brokerdealers are undesignated derivatives and accordingly are marked to market through earnings at december 31 2004 there were contractual commitments to extend credit to borrowers aggregating approximately 181500 and open forward delivery sale contracts aggregating approximately 300000 

  

contractual obligations 

  

our fixed noncancelable obligations as of december 31 2004 were as follows 

  

        

critical accounting policies 

  

general 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods we continually evaluate the estimates we use to prepare the consolidated financial statements and update those estimates as necessary in general our estimates are based on historical experience on information from third party professionals and other various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances actual results could differ materially from those estimates made by management 

  

variable interest entities 

  

in december 2003 the fasb issued revised interpretation no 46 “fin 46r” consolidation of variable interest entities  which was effective for us as of march 31 2004 fin 46r requires the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity to consolidate that entity the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is the party that absorbs a majority of the variable interest entity’s expected losses receives a majority of the entity’s expected residual returns or both as a result of ownership contractual interests or other financial interests in the entity expected losses are the expected negative variability in the fair value of an entity’s net assets exclusive of its variable interests and expected residual returns are the expected positive variability in the fair value of an entity’s net assets exclusive of its variable interests 

  

forward contracts such as the fixedprice purchase agreements utilized by us to acquire finished lot inventory are deemed to be “variable interests” under fin 46r therefore the development entities with which we enter fixedprice purchase agreements are examined under fin 46r for possible consolidation by us including the joint venture limited liability corporations “llc’s” utilized by us on a limited basis we have developed a methodology to determine whether we or the owners of the applicable development entity are the primary beneficiary of a development entity the methodology used to evaluate our primary beneficiary status requires substantial judgment and estimation these judgments and estimates involve assigning probabilities to various estimated cash flow possibilities relative to the development entity’s expected profits and losses and the cash flows associated with changes in the fair value of finished lots under contract because we do not have any contractual or ownership interests in the development entities with which we contract to buy finished lots other than our limited use of the llc’s we generally do not have the ability to compel these development entities to provide financial or other data to assist us in the performance of the primary beneficiary evaluation in many instances these development entities provide little if any financial information this lack of direct information from the development entities may result in our evaluation being conducted solely based on the aforementioned judgments and estimates further where we deem ourselves to be the primary beneficiary of a development entity created after december 31 2003 and that development entity refuses to provide financial statements we utilize estimation techniques to perform the consolidation while we believe that our estimation techniques provide a reasonable basis of providing the financial condition of a development entity that refuses to provide financial statements the actual financial condition of the development entity could differ from that reported although we believe that our accounting policy is designed to properly assess our primary beneficiary status relative to our involvement with the development entities from which we acquire finished lots changes to the probabilities and the cash flow possibilities used in our evaluation could produce widely different conclusions regarding our status or nonstatus as a development entity’s primary beneficiary 

  

homebuilding inventory 

  

the carrying value of inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market value cost of lots and completed and uncompleted housing units represent the accumulated actual cost of the units field construction supervisors’ salaries and related direct overhead expenses are included in inventory costs interest costs are not capitalized into inventory upon settlement the cost of the unit is expensed on a specific identification basis cost of manufacturing materials is determined on a firstin firstout basis recoverability and impairment if any is primarily evaluated by analyzing sales of comparable assets we believe that our accounting policy is designed to properly assess the carrying value of homebuilding inventory 

  

contract land deposits 

  

we purchase finished lots under fixedprice purchase agreements that require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the contract the deposits are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percentage of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots we maintain an allowance for losses on contract land deposits that we believe is sufficient to provide for losses in the existing contract land deposit portfolio the allowance reflects our judgment of the present loss exposure at the end of the reporting period considering market and economic conditions sales absorption and profitability within specific communities and terms of the various contracts although we consider the allowance for losses on contract land deposits reflected on the december 31 2004 balance sheet to be adequate there can be no assurance that this allowance will prove to be adequate over time to cover losses due to unanticipated adverse changes in the economy or other events adversely affecting specific markets or the homebuilding industry 

  

intangible assets 

  

reorganization value in excess of identifiable assets “excess reorganization value” and goodwill are no longer subject to amortization upon the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets  rather excess reorganization value and goodwill are subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fairvalue based test we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate that the remaining value of excess reorganization value and goodwill may not be recoverable at december 31 2004 we believe that excess reorganization value and 

  

goodwill were not impaired this conclusion is based on our judgment considering such factors as our history of operating success our well recognized brand names and the significant positions held in the markets in which we operate however changes in strategy or adverse changes in market conditions could impact this judgment and require an impairment loss to be recognized for the amount that the carrying value of excess reorganization value andor goodwill exceeds their fair value 

  

warrantyproduct liability accruals 

  

warranty and product liability accruals are established to provide for estimated future costs as a result of construction and product defects product recalls and litigation incidental to our business liability estimates are determined based on our judgment considering such factors as historical experience the likely current cost of corrective action manufacturers’ and subcontractors’ participation in sharing the cost of corrective action consultations with third party experts such as engineers and discussions with our general counsel and other outside counsel retained to handle specific product liability cases although we consider the warranty and product liability accrual reflected on the december 31 2004 balance sheet see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements to be adequate there can be no assurance that this accrual will prove to be adequate over time to cover losses due to increased costs for material and labor the inability or refusal of manufacturers or subcontractors to financially participate in corrective action unanticipated adverse legal settlements or other unanticipated changes to the assumptions used to estimate the warranty and product liability accrual

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

  

market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates our market risk arises from interest rate risk inherent in our financial instruments interest rate risk is the possibility that changes in interest rates will cause unfavorable changes in net income or in the value of interest ratesensitive assets liabilities and commitments lower interest rates tend to increase demand for mortgage loans for home purchasers while higher interest rates make it more difficult for potential borrowers to purchase residential properties and to qualify for mortgage loans we have no market rate sensitive instruments held for speculative or trading purposes 

  

our mortgage banking segment is exposed to interest rate risk as it relates to its lending activities the mortgage banking segment originates mortgage loans which are either sold through optional or mandatory forward delivery contracts into the secondary markets all of the mortgage banking segment’s loan portfolio is held for sale and subject to forward sale commitments nvrm also sells substantially all of its mortgage servicing rights on a servicing released basis 

  

our homebuilding segment generates operating liquidity and acquires capital assets through fixedrate and variablerate debt the homebuilding segment’s primary variablerate debt is a working capital revolving credit facility that currently provides for unsecured borrowings up to 150000 subject to certain borrowing base limitations the working capital credit facility expires in august 2007 and outstanding amounts bear interest at our election based on the type of borrowing and other criteria set forth in the facility the weighted average interest rate for the amounts outstanding under the facility was 40 during 2004 there were no amounts outstanding under the working capital revolving credit facility at december 31 2004 at december 31 2004 there were no borrowing base limitations reducing the amount available to us for borrowings 

  

nvrm generates operating liquidity primarily through the mortgage warehouse facility which currently has a borrowing limit of 175000 the interest rate under the mortgage warehouse facility is either i the london interbank offering rate “libor” plus 125 or ii 125 to the extent that nvrm provides compensating balances the weightedaverage interest rate for amounts outstanding under the mortgage warehouse facility was 19 during 2004 mortgage loans and gestation mortgagebacked 

  

securities collateralize the mortgage warehouse facility borrowings the mortgage warehouse facility is annually renewable and currently expires in august 2005 there was 9726 outstanding under the mortgage warehouse facility at december 31 2004 the mortgage warehouse facility agreement includes among other items restrictions on nvrm incurring additional borrowings and making intercompany dividends and tax payments in addition nvrm is required to maintain a minimum net worth of 14000 at december 31 2004 borrowing base limitations reduced the amount available to nvrm for borrowings to approximately 131000 

  

the following table represents the contractual balances of our onbalance sheet financial instruments in dollars at the expected maturity dates as well as the fair values of those onbalance sheet financial instruments at december 31 2004 the expected maturity categories take into consideration historical and anticipated prepayment speeds as well as actual amortization of principal and do not take into consideration the reinvestment of cash or the refinancing of existing indebtedness because we sell all of the mortgage loans we originate into the secondary markets we have made the assumption that the portfolio of mortgage loans held for sale will mature in the first year consequently outstanding warehouse borrowings and repurchase facilities are also assumed to mature in the first year

 item 1 business 

  

general 

  

nvr inc “nvr” was formed in 1980 as nvhomes inc nvr operates in two business segments 1 homebuilding and 2 mortgage banking nvr conducts its homebuilding activities directly and its mortgage banking operations primarily through a wholly owned subsidiary nvr mortgage finance inc “nvrm” unless the context otherwise requires references to “nvr” include nvr and its subsidiaries 

  

nvr is one of the largest homebuilders in the united states and in the washington dc and baltimore md metropolitan areas approximately 42 of our home settlements in 2003 occurred in the washington dc and baltimore md metropolitan areas which amounted to 54 of nvr’s 2003 homebuilding revenues nvr’s homebuilding operations include the construction and sale of singlefamily detached homes townhomes and condominium buildings under three tradenames ryan homes nvhomes and fox ridge homes the ryan homes and fox ridge homes products are moderately priced and marketed primarily to firsttime homeowners and firsttime moveup buyers the nvhomes product is marketed primarily to moveup and upscale buyers and is built in the washington dc baltimore md and philadelphia pa metropolitan areas the ryan homes product is built in eighteen metropolitan areas located in maryland virginia west virginia pennsylvania new york north carolina south carolina ohio new jersey and delaware beginning in 2004 the ryan homes product will no longer be sold in the nashville tn metropolitan area the fox ridge homes product is built solely in the nashville tn metropolitan area in 2003 the average price of a unit settled by nvr was approximately 297900 

  

nvr does not engage in the land development business instead nvr acquires finished building lots at market prices from various development entities under fixed price purchase agreements that require deposits that may be forfeited if nvr fails to perform under the agreement the deposits required under the purchase agreements are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percentage typically ranging up to 10 of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots 

  

this lot acquisition strategy reduces the financial requirements and risks associated with direct land ownership and land development nvr may at its option choose for any reason and at any time not to perform under these purchase agreements by delivering notice of its intent not to acquire the finished lots under contract nvr’s sole legal obligation and economic loss for failure to perform under these purchase agreements is limited to the amount of the deposit pursuant to the liquidating damage provision contained within the purchase agreement nvr does not have any financial guarantees or completion obligations and does not guarantee specific performance under these purchase agreements nvr generally seeks to maintain control over a supply of lots believed to be suitable to meet its sales objectives for the next 24 to 36 months 

  

in addition to building and selling homes nvr provides a number of mortgagerelated services through its mortgage banking operations which operate in 11 states through office locations in each of nvr’s homebuilding markets nvrm originates mortgage loans predominantly for nvr’s homebuyers nvrm generates revenues primarily from origination fees gains on sales of loans and title fees nvrm sells substantially all of the mortgage loans it closes into the secondary markets on a servicing released basis 

  

segment information for nvr’s homebuilding and mortgage banking businesses is included in note 2 to nvr’s consolidated financial statements 

  

homebuilding 

  

products 

  

nvr offers singlefamily detached homes townhomes and condominium buildings with many different basic home designs these home designs have a variety of elevations and numerous other options homes built by nvr combine traditional or colonial exterior designs with contemporary interior designs and amenities and generally include two to four bedrooms nvr’s homes range from approximately 1000 to 7300 square feet and are priced from approximately 90000 to 1600000 

  

markets 

  

nvr operates in the following geographic regions 

  

   

further discussion of settlements new orders and backlog activity by region for each of the last three years can be found in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations see item 7 

  

backlog 

  

backlog units and dollars were 6890 and approximately 23 billion respectively at december 31 2003 compared to backlog units of 6357 and dollars of approximately 20 billion at december 31 2002 based on historical trends nvr anticipates that approximately 15 of the units in backlog at december 31 2003 will cancel prior to settlement the remaining 85 of the units are expected to settle in 2004 

  

construction 

  

independent subcontractors under fixedprice contracts perform construction work on nvr’s homes the subcontractors’ work is performed under the supervision of nvr employees who monitor quality control nvr uses many independent subcontractors in its various markets and is not dependent on any single subcontractor or on a small number of subcontractors 

  

land development 

  

nvr is not in the land development business nvr purchases finished lots from various land developers under fixed price purchase agreements that require deposits that may be forfeited if nvr fails to perform under the agreement the deposits required under the purchase agreements are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percentage typically ranging up to 10 of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots nvr is not dependent on any single developer or on a small number of developers 

  

sales and marketing 

  

nvr’s preferred marketing method is for customers to visit a furnished model home featuring many builtin options and a landscaped lot the garages of these model homes are usually converted into temporary sales centers where alternative facades and floor plans are displayed and designs for other models are available for review sales representatives are compensated predominantly on a commission basis 

  

regulation 

  

nvr and its subcontractors must comply with various federal state and local zoning building environmental advertising and consumer credit statutes rules and regulations as well as other regulations and requirements in connection with its construction and sales activities all of these regulations have increased the cost to produce and market nvr’s products counties and cities in which nvr builds homes have at times declared moratoriums on the issuance of building permits and imposed other restrictions in the areas in which sewage treatment facilities and other public facilities do not reach minimum standards to date restrictive zoning laws and the imposition of moratoriums have not had a material adverse effect on nvr’s construction activities 

  

competition and market factors 

  

the housing industry is highly competitive nvr competes with numerous homebuilders of varying size ranging from local to national in scope some of whom have greater financial resources than nvr nvr also faces competition from the home resale market nvr’s homebuilding operations compete primarily on the basis of price location design quality service and reputation nvr historically has been one of the market leaders in each of the markets where nvr builds homes 

  

the housing industry is cyclical and is affected by consumer confidence levels prevailing economic conditions and interest rates other factors that affect the housing industry and the demand for new homes include the availability and increases in the cost of land labor and materials changes in consumer preferences demographic trends and the availability of mortgage finance programs 

  

nvr is dependent upon building material suppliers for a continuous flow of raw materials whenever possible nvr utilizes standard products available from multiple sources such raw materials have been generally available in adequate supply 

  

mortgage banking 

  

nvr provides a number of mortgage related services to its homebuilding customers through its mortgage banking operations the mortgage banking operations of nvr also include separate subsidiaries that broker title insurance and perform title searches in connection with mortgage loan closings for which they receive commissions and fees because nvrm originates mortgage loans predominately for nvr’s homebuilding customers nvrm is dependent on nvr’s homebuilding segment in 2003 nvrm closed approximately 10200 loans with an aggregate principal amount of approximately 24 billion 

  

nvrm sells substantially all of the mortgage loans it closes to investors in the secondary markets on a servicing released basis nvrm is an approved sellerservicer for fnma gnma fhlmc va and fha mortgage loans 

  

competition and market factors 

  

nvrm operates through 15 branches in 11 states nvrm’s main competition comes from national regional and local mortgage bankers mortgage brokers thrifts and banks in each of these markets nvrm competes primarily on the basis of customer service variety of products offered interest rates offered prices of ancillary services and relative financing availability and costs 

  

regulation 

  

nvrm is an approved sellerservicer of fnma gnma fhlmc fha and va mortgage loans and is subject to all of those agencies’ rules and regulations these rules and regulations restrict certain activities of nvrm nvrm is currently eligible and expects to remain eligible to participate in such programs in addition nvrm is subject to regulation at the state and federal level with respect to specific origination selling and servicing practices 

  

pipeline 

  

nvrm’s mortgage loans in process which have not closed “pipeline” at december 31 2003 and 2002 had an aggregate principal balance of 15 billion and 13 billion respectively nvrm anticipates that approximately 25 of its pipeline at december 31 2003 will cancel prior to closing the remaining 75 of the pipeline is expected to close in 2004 

  

employees 

  

at december 31 2003 nvr employed 3852 fulltime persons of whom 1495 were officers and management personnel 192 were technical and construction personnel 713 were sales personnel 537 were administrative personnel and 915 were engaged in various other service and labor activities none of nvr’s employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement and nvr has never experienced a work stoppage management believes that its employee relations are good

 risk factors 

  

our business can be negatively impacted by interest rate movements inflation and other economic factors 

  

our business is affected by the risks generally incident to the residential construction business including 

  

   

   

   

   

high rates of inflation generally affect the homebuilding industry adversely because of their adverse impact on interest rates high interest rates not only increase the cost of borrowed funds to homebuilders but also have a significant effect on housing demand and on the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective purchasers we are also subject to potential volatility in the price of commodities that impact costs of materials used in our homebuilding business increases in prevailing interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations 

  

our financial results also are affected by the risks generally incident to our mortgage banking business including interest rate levels the impact of government regulation of mortgage loan originations and servicing and the need to issue forward commitments to fund and sell mortgage loans our homebuilding customers accounted for almost all of our mortgage banking business in 2003 our mortgage banking business is therefore affected by the volume of our continuing homebuilding operations 

  

our mortgage banking business also is affected by interest rate fluctuations we also may experience marketing losses resulting from daily increases in interest rates to the extent we are unable to match interest rates and amounts on loans we have committed to originate with forward commitments from third parties to purchase such loans we employ procedures designed to mitigate any such potential losses but there can be no assurance that such procedures will be entirely successful increases in interest rates may have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations 

  

these factors and thus the homebuilding business have tended to be cyclical in nature any downturn in the national economy or the local economies of the markets in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations in particular approximately 42 of our home settlements during 2003 occurred in the washington dc and baltimore md metropolitan areas which amounted to 54 of nvr’s 2003 homebuilding revenues thus nvr is dependent to a significant extent on the economy and demand for housing in those areas 

  

our inability to secure and control an adequate inventory of lots could adversely impact our operations 

  

the results of our homebuilding operations are dependent upon our continuing ability to control an adequate number of homebuilding lots in desirable locations we have not experienced significant shortages in the supply of lots in our principal markets or difficulty in controlling lots through fixed price purchase contracts in sufficient numbers and in adequate locations to fulfill our business plan and on terms consistent with our past operations there can be no assurance however that an adequate supply of building lots will continue to be available on terms similar to those available in the past or that we will not be required to devote a greater amount of capital to controlling building lots than we have historically although we believe that we will have adequate capital resources and financing to control a sufficient number of building lots to fulfill our current business plan there can be no assurance that our resources and financing will in fact be sufficient to meet our expectations an insufficient supply of building lots in one or more of our markets or our inability to purchase or finance building lots on reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations 

  

inventory risk can be substantial for homebuilders the market value of building lots and housing inventories can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing market conditions in addition inventory carrying costs can be significant and can result in losses in a poorly performing project or market we must in the ordinary course of our business continuously seek and make acquisitions of lots for expansion into new markets as well as for replacement and expansion within our current markets although we employ various measures designed to manage inventory risks there can be no assurance that such measures will be successful in the event of significant changes in economic or market conditions we may dispose of certain subdivision inventories on a bulk or other basis which may result in a loss which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations 

  

our current indebtedness may impact our future operations and our ability to access necessary financing 

  

our homebuilding operations are dependent in part on the availability and cost of working capital financing and may be adversely affected by a shortage or an increase in the cost of such financing we believe that we will be able to meet our needs for working capital financing from cash generated from operations and from our existing or a replacement working capital revolving credit facility if we require working capital greater than that provided by our operations and our credit facility we may be required to seek to increase the amount available under the facility or to obtain alternative financing no assurance can be given that additional or replacement financing will be available on terms that are favorable or acceptable if we are at any time unsuccessful in obtaining sufficient capital to fund our planned homebuilding expenditures we may experience a substantial delay in the completion of any homes then under construction any delay could result in cost increases and could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

  

our existing indebtedness contains financial and other restrictive covenants and any future indebtedness may also contain covenants these covenants include limitations on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness pay cash dividends and make distributions make loans and investments enter into transactions with affiliates effect certain asset sales incur certain liens merge or consolidate with any other person or transfer all or substantially all of our properties and assets substantial losses by us or other action or inaction by us or our subsidiaries could result in the violation of one or more of these covenants which could result in decreased liquidity or a default on our indebtedness thereby having a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations 

  

our mortgage banking operations are dependent on the availability cost and other terms of mortgage warehouse financing and may be adversely affected by any shortage or increased cost of such financing although we believe that our needs for mortgage warehouse financing will be met by our existing mortgage warehouse arrangements and repurchase agreements no assurance can be given that any additional or replacement financing will be available on terms that are favorable or acceptable our mortgage banking operations are also dependent upon the securitization market for mortgagebacked securities and could be materially adversely affected by any fluctuation or downturn in such market 

  

government regulations and environmental matters can negatively affect our operations 

  

we are subject to various local state and federal statutes ordinances rules and regulations concerning zoning building design construction and similar matters including local regulations that impose restrictive zoning and density requirements in order to limit the number of homes that can eventually be built within the boundaries of a particular area we have from time to time been subject to and may also be subject in the future to periodic delays in our homebuilding projects due to building moratoriums in the areas in which we operate changes in regulations that restrict homebuilding activities in one or more of our principal markets could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations 

  

we are also subject to a variety of local state and federal statutes ordinances rules and regulations concerning the protection of health and the environment we are subject to a variety of environmental conditions that can affect our business and our homebuilding projects the particular environmental laws that apply to any given homebuilding site vary greatly according to the location and environmental condition of the site and the present and former uses of the site and adjoining properties environmental laws and conditions may result in delays cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs or prohibit or severely restrict homebuilding activity in certain environmentally sensitive regions or areas thereby adversely affecting our sales profitability stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations 

  

we are an approved sellerservicer of fnma gnma fhlmc fha and va mortgage loans and are subject to all of those agencies’ rules and regulations any significant impairment of our eligibility to sellservice these loans could have a material adverse impact on our mortgage operations in addition we are subject to regulation at the state and federal level with respect to specific origination selling and servicing practices adverse changes in governmental regulation may have a negative impact on our mortgage loan origination business 

  

we face competition in our housing and mortgage banking operations 

  

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive we compete with numerous homebuilders of varying size ranging from local to national in scope some of whom have greater financial resources than we do we face competition 

  

   

   

   

our homebuilding operations compete primarily on the basis of price location design quality service and reputation historically we have been one of the leading homebuilders in each of the markets where we operate 

  

the mortgage banking industry is also competitive our main competition comes from national regional and local mortgage bankers thrifts banks and mortgage brokers in each of these markets our mortgage banking operations compete primarily on the basis of customer service variety of products offered interest rates offered prices of ancillary services and relative financing availability and costs 

  

there can be no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully in our homebuilding or mortgage banking operations an inability to effectively compete may have an adverse impact on our sales profitability stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations 

  

a shortage of building materials or labor may adversely impact our operations 

  

the homebuilding business has in the past from time to time experienced material and labor shortages including shortages in insulation drywall certain carpentry work concrete as well as fluctuating lumber prices and supply in addition high employment levels and strong construction market conditions could restrict the labor force available to our subcontractors and us in one or more of our markets while we are not presently experiencing any serious material or labor shortages significant increases in costs resulting from these shortages or delays in construction of homes could have a material adverse effect upon our sales profitability stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations 

  

weatherrelated and other events beyond our control may adversely impact our operations 

  

extreme weather or other events such as hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes forest fires floods terrorist attacks or war may affect our markets our operations and our profitability these events may impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or subcontractors causing us material increases in costs or delays in construction of homes which could have a material adverse effect upon our sales profitability stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations

overview 

  

nvr’s primary business is the construction and sale of singlefamily detached homes townhomes and condominium buildings in the markets described below to fully serve our homebuilding customers nvr also operates mortgage banking and title services businesses nvr continues to manage its business through a conservative operating strategy by not engaging in land development and by primarily constructing homes on a presold basis additionally nvr focuses on obtaining and maintaining a leading market position in each of the markets it serves this strategy allows nvr to gain valuable efficiencies and competitive advantages in our markets which management believes contributes to minimizing the adverse effects of regional economic cycles and provides growth opportunities within these markets the effective execution of this operating strategy resulted in another year of continued growth in operating activity and earnings consolidated revenues and net income for 2003 increased 18 and 27 respectively from 2002 the increase in earnings and the continuation of the stock repurchase program pursuant to which nvr repurchased approximately 1100000 shares during 2003 resulted in a 34 increase in dilutive earnings per share over 2002 results 

  

nvr’s continued success is contingent upon our ability to control an adequate supply of finished lots on which to build nvr acquires finished building lots at market prices from various development entities under fixed price purchase agreements that require deposits that may be forfeited if nvr fails to perform under the agreement as of december 31 2003 nvr had deposits of approximately 284000 which controlled approximately 70000 lots nvr believes that this supply is adequate to suitably meet its sales objectives 

  

nvr operates in the following regions 

  

   

the following table summarizes settlements new orders and backlog unit activity for each of the last three years by region 

  

   

homebuilding segment 

  

homebuilding revenues for 2003 increased 18 to 3600917 compared to revenues of 3060671 in 2002 the increase in revenues resulted primarily from an 11 increase in the average settlement price to 2979 in 2003 from 2685 in 2002 and to an increase of 6 in the number of homes settled to 12050 in 2003 from 11368 in 2002 the increase in average settlement prices is primarily attributable to favorable market conditions resulting in increased sales prices in a majority of nvr’s markets the increase in the number of homes settled is primarily attributable to a 14 higher backlog at the beginning of 2003 as compared to the beginning of 2002 and a 6 increase in new orders to 7019 units during the first six months of 2003 from 6623 units during the same period in 2002 

  

homebuilding revenues for 2002 increased 20 to 3060671 compared to revenues of 2559744 in 2001 the increase in revenues was primarily due to a 10 increase in the number of homes settled to 11368 in 2002 from 10372 in 2001 and to a 9 increase in the average settlement price to 2685 in 2002 from 2460 in 2001 the increase in the number of homes settled was primarily the result of an 8 higher backlog at the beginning of 2002 as compared to the beginning of 2001 and to a 7 increase in the number of new orders for the first six months of 2002 to 6623 units from 6165 units for the same period in 2001 the increase in the average settlement price was primarily attributable to favorable market conditions resulting in price increases in a majority of nvr’s markets and to a 2 increase as a percentage of total settlements in single family detached home settlements which in comparison are generally higher priced than nvr’s single family attached homes 

  

new orders for the full year ended 2003 increased 3 to 12583 units from 12167 units in 2002 the value of new orders increased 13 to 3950413 in 2003 from 3501793 in 2002 the increase in new orders occurred predominately in the north region as a result of a 5 increase in the average number of active communities within this region the decrease in new orders in the washington region was primarily due to a 2 reduction in the average number of active communities within that region new orders for the full year ended 2002 increased 13 from the number of new orders in 2001 new orders increased predominately in markets outside the baltimore and washington dc market areas 

  

gross profit margins for 2003 increased to 25 compared to 24 for 2002 the increase in profit margins is attributable to the aforementioned favorable market conditions allowing nvr to raise sales prices in a majority of the markets nvr serves gross profit margins for 2002 increased to 24 compared to 22 for 2001 the increase in 2002 gross profit margins was primarily due to favorable market conditions which provided nvr the opportunity to increase selling prices in a majority of its markets and to relatively stable costs for lumber and certain other commodities year over year 

  

selling general and administrative expenses “sga” for 2003 increased approximately 3 from 2002 and as a percentage of revenues decreased to approximately 64 in 2003 from 74 in 2002 the increase in sga costs is primarily attributable to increases in personnel costs and selling and marketing costs of approximately 13000 and 8000 respectively to facilitate continued growth objectives in existing markets and to an approximate 9000 increase in other general and administrative costs incidental to the aforementioned increase in revenues these increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately 24000 in 2003 from 2002 related to the termination of certain management incentive compensation plans at the end of 2002 selling general and administrative expenses “sga” for 2002 increased 48132 or 27 as compared to 2001 and as a percentage of revenues increased to 74 from 70 the increase in sga dollars was primarily attributable to a 23000 increase in certain management incentives an approximate 15000 increase in wages resulting from increases in personnel to support nvr’s continued growth and to the aforementioned increase in revenues 

  

backlog units and dollars were 6890 and 2323703 respectively at december 31 2003 compared to backlog units of 6357 and dollars of 1962115 at december 31 2002 the increase in backlog units is due primarily to a 14 higher backlog at the beginning of 2003 as compared to the beginning of 2002 the 18 increase in backlog dollars is attributable to an 8 increase in backlog units and a 12 increase in the average price of new orders for the six months ended december 31 2003 as compared to the same period in 2002 backlog units and dollars were 6357 and 1962115 respectively at december 31 2002 compared to backlog units of 5558 and dollars of 1511503 at december 31 2001 the increase in backlog dollars was primarily due to a 14 increase in backlog units at december 31 2002 and to an 11 increase in the average selling price of new orders for the sixmonth period ended december 31 2002 as compared to the same period for 2001 the increase in backlog units was primarily attributable to a 20 increase in new orders for the sixmonth period ended december 31 2002 as compared to the same period for 2001

nvr conducts its mortgage banking activity through nvr mortgage finance inc “nvrm” a wholly owned subsidiary nvrm focuses almost exclusively on serving the homebuilding segment’s customer base following is a table of financial and statistical data for the three years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 

  

   

loan closing volume for the year ended december 31 2003 increased 95 over 2002 the 2003 increase compared to 2002 is solely attributable to a 95 increase in the average loan amount due to the homebuilding segment’s higher average selling prices the number of units closed was flat in 2003 compared to 2002 loan closing volume for the year ended december 31 2002 increased 15 over 2001 the 2002 increase compared to 2001 was attributable to a 5 increase in the number of units closed and to a 10 increase in the average loan amount due to the homebuilding segment’s higher average selling prices 

  

also during 2003 nvrm began to sell its conforming and government loans on a servicing released basis rather than selling the servicing rights separately on a periodic bulk basis nvrm has also implemented systems and procedures to more efficiently deliver loans into its sales channels which has resulted in the substantial reduction of mortgage loans held for sale at december 31 2003 compared to december 31 2002 

  

operating income for the year ended december 31 2003 increased approximately 11100 over 2002 the 2003 increase is primarily due to an increase in mortgage banking fees attributable to the aforementioned 95 increase in closed loan volume increased secondary marketing gains and higher revenues per loan secondary marketing gains for 2003 increased approximately 2000 over 2002 average revenues per loan including origination fees ancillary fees and discount points for 2003 increased by approximately 7 

  

operating income for the year ended december 31 2002 increased approximately 14600 over 2001 the increase is primarily due to an increase in mortgage banking fees attributable to the aforementioned 15 increase in closed loan volume increased secondary marketing gains and higher revenues per loan secondary marketing gains for the year ended december 31 2002 increased approximately 4000 over 2001 due to a more favorable pricing environment average revenues per loan including origination fees ancillary fees and discount points for 2002 increased by approximately 24 primarily due to a more favorable market environment than that experienced in 2001 the 2001 year was also impacted by approximately 1700 for costs associated with discontinued retail activity which was the primary cause of the overall decrease in general and administrative costs when comparing 2002 to 2001 

  

seasonality 

  

overall nvr does not experience material seasonal fluctuations in sales settlements or loan closings 

  

effective tax rate 

  

nvr’s consolidated effective tax rates were 397 382 and 400 in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively the lower effective tax rate in 2002 was primarily due to the amendment of a longterm cash incentive plan requiring executive officers to defer receipt of payments due under the plan until separation of service with nvr the effect of this amendment converted compensation expensed prior to january 1 2002 from a permanent tax difference to a temporary tax difference producing an approximate 7800 deferred tax benefit 

  

recent accounting pronouncements 

  

in january 2003 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued interpretation no 46 “fin 46” consolidation of variable interest entities  fin 46 requires the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity “vie” to consolidate that entity the primary beneficiary of a vie is the party that absorbs a majority of the vie’s expected losses receives a majority of the entity’s expected residual returns or both as a result of ownership contractual or other financial interests in the entity prior to the issuance of fin 46 an enterprise generally consolidated an entity when the enterprise had a controlling financial interest in the entity through ownership of a majority voting interest in december 2003 fasb revised fin 46 “fin 46r” deferring the application of the provisions of fin 46 for an interest held in a vie or potential vie until the end of the first interim or annual period ending after march 15 2004 if the public entity has not issued financial statements reporting that vie in accordance with fin 46 

  

during the period from february 1 2003 through september 30 2003 nvr had entered into fixed priced purchase agreements with an aggregate purchase price of approximately 900000 by making or committing to make deposits of approximately 80000 nvr has evaluated all fixed price purchase agreements entered into during that period and has determined that it is the primary beneficiary of certain of the variable interest entities with which it has entered into purchase agreements nvr estimated the current fair value of the land underlying these purchase agreements and consolidated that amount and a related liability the liability represents the difference between the estimated current fair value of the land under contract and nvr’s related deposits the effect of the consolidation at december 31 2003 was the inclusion on the balance sheet of 12807 to inventory not owned consolidated per fin 46 with a corresponding inclusion of 12071 to liabilities related to inventory not owned consolidated per fin 46 nvr does not have access to the financial records of the development entities with which it enters into fixed price purchase agreements and as a result was unable to consolidate the variable interest entities’ results of operations or cash flows nvr has deferred implementation of fin 46 on all other fixed price purchase agreements until the first quarter of 2004 as permitted under revised fin 46 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

lines of credit and notes payable 

  

nvr’s homebuilding segment generally provides for its working capital cash requirements using cash generated from operations and a shortterm unsecured working capital revolving credit facility in august 2003 nvr executed a credit agreement for a 150000 working capital revolving credit facility the “facility” replacing nvr’s 135000 credit facility scheduled to expire in may 2004 the facility bears interest at a variable rate based on the type of borrowing and other criteria set forth in the facility the weighted average interest rate for borrowings outstanding during 2003 was 27 the facility expires in august 2007 up to 50000 of the facility is currently available for issuance in the form of letters of credit of which 20696 was outstanding at december 31 2003 there were no direct borrowings outstanding under the facility as of december 31 2003 at december 31 2003 there were no borrowing base limitations reducing the amount available to nvr for borrowings 

  

nvr’s mortgage banking segment provides for its mortgage origination and other operating activities using cash generated from operations as well as various shortterm credit facilities nvrm has available an annually renewable mortgage warehouse facility the “mortgage warehouse revolving credit agreement” with an aggregate borrowing limit of 175000 to fund its mortgage origination activities 

  

under which 53340 was outstanding at december 31 2003 as of december 31 2003 borrowing base limitations reduced the amount available to nvrm for borrowings to approximately 87600 the mortgage warehouse revolving credit agreement expires in august 2004 the interest rate under the mortgage warehouse revolving credit agreement is either i the london interbank offering rate “libor” plus 125 or ii 125 to the extent that nvrm provides compensating balances the weighted average interest rate for amounts outstanding under the mortgage warehouse revolving credit agreement was 18 during 2003 nvrm’s mortgage warehouse facility limits the ability of nvrm to transfer funds to nvr in the form of dividends loans or advances in addition nvrm is required to maintain a minimum net worth of 14000 nvrm also currently has available an aggregate of 50000 of borrowing capacity in an uncommitted gestation and repurchase agreement amounts outstanding thereunder accrue interest at various rates tied to the libor rate and are collateralized by gestation mortgagebacked securities and whole loans the weighted average interest rate for amounts outstanding under this uncommitted facility was 18 during 2003 there were no borrowings outstanding under the gestation and repurchase agreement at december 31 2003 

  

on january 20 1998 nvr filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission for the issuance of up to 400000 of nvr’s debt securities the shelf registration statement was declared effective on february 27 1998 and provides that securities may be offered from time to time in one or more series and in the form of senior or subordinated debt nvr has 55000 available for issuance under the shelf registration 

  

on june 17 2003 nvr completed an offering at par for 200000 of 5 senior notes due 2010 the “notes” under the shelf registration the offering of the notes resulted in aggregate net proceeds of approximately 199400 after deducting offering expenses the notes mature on june 15 2010 and bear interest at 5 payable semiannually in arrears on june 15 and december 15 commencing on december 15 2003 the notes are general unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of nvr’s existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness and indebtedness under our existing credit facility the notes are senior in right of payment to any future subordinated indebtedness that nvr may incur nvr may redeem the notes in whole or in part at any time upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days notice at a redemption price equal to the greater of a 100 of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed or b the discounted present value of the remaining scheduled payments of the notes to be redeemed plus in each case accrued and unpaid interest 

  

on july 14 2003 nvr used approximately 120700 of the proceeds received from the sale of the notes to redeem all of the 115000 outstanding 8 senior notes due 2005 at a price of 104 of the principal amount outstanding including the payment of accrued interest the redemption resulted in a charge to pretax homebuilding income of 8503 

  

nvr expects to file a new shelf registration in 2004 to register up to 1000000 for future offer and sale of debt securities common shares preferred shares depositary shares representing preferred shares and warrants proceeds received from future offerings issued under this shelf registration are expected to be used for general corporate purposes this discussion of nvr’s expected new shelf registration does not constitute an offer of any securities for sale 

  

equity repurchases 

  

nvr expects that it will from time to time repurchase shares of its common stock pursuant to repurchase authorizations by the board of directors and subject to the restrictions contained within nvr’s debt agreements in february 2003 the board of directors approved the repurchase of up to an aggregate of 150000 of nvr’s common stock in one or more open market andor privately negotiated transactions as of november 2003 nvr had fully utilized the february 2003 stock repurchase authorization in august 2003 the board of directors approved the repurchase of up to an aggregate of 200000 of nvr’s common stock in one or more open market andor privately negotiated transactions as of december 2003 nvr had fully utilized the august 2003 stock repurchase authorization in december 2003 the board of directors approved the repurchase of up to an aggregate of 200000 of nvr’s common stock in one or more open market andor 

  

privately negotiated transactions as of february 9 2004 nvr had repurchased shares of its common stock at an aggregate purchase price of approximately 123000 pursuant to the december 2003 repurchase authorization 

  

cash flows 

  

as shown in nvr’s consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended december 31 2003 nvr’s operating activities provided cash of 552785 for this period cash was provided primarily by homebuilding operations and by the utilization of a tax benefit of 110171 as a result of employee stock option exercises the tax benefit on employee stock option exercises was recorded directly to equity and reduced estimated tax payments during the year increased homebuilding activity contributed to the increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses additionally customer deposits have increased 38831 as a result of the aforementioned increase in backlog units and due to an increase in the average deposit collected on those units in 2003 as compared to 2002 cash was used to fund increases in homebuilding inventory of 87099 excluding the change in inventory not owned consolidated per fin 46 as discussed previously in recent accounting pronouncements  additionally cash was used to make deposits on fixed price purchase agreements with developers to acquire control of finished lots nvr controlled approximately 70000 lots at december 31 2003 

  

net cash provided by investing activities was 11337 for the year ended december 31 2003 primarily due to proceeds received from the sale of mortgage servicing rights and to principal payments received on mortgage loans held for sale partially offset by capital spending 

  

net cash used for financing activities was 474748 for the year ended december 31 2003 nvr purchased approximately 1100000 shares of its common stock in 2003 for an aggregate purchase price of 460391 additionally as noted in the previous section nvr issued 200000 in notes and used approximately 120700 of the proceeds from this issuance to redeem all of the outstanding 8 senior notes due 2005 including accrued interest 

  

at december 31 2003 the homebuilding and mortgage banking segments had restricted cash of 17023 and 3011 respectively which includes certain customer deposits mortgagor tax insurance completion escrows and other amounts collected at closing which relates to mortgage loans held for sale and to home sales 

  

nvr believes that internally generated cash and borrowings available under credit facilities will be sufficient to satisfy near and longer term cash requirements for working capital and debt service in both its homebuilding and mortgage banking operations 

  

off –balance sheet arrangements 

  

as previously noted in the overview  nvr acquires finished building lots at market prices from various development entities under fixed price purchase agreements this lot acquisition strategy reduces the financial requirements and risks associated with direct land ownership and land development under these purchase agreements nvr is typically required to make deposits in the form of cash or letters of credit which may be forfeited if nvr fails to perform under the agreement at december 31 2003 nvr had entered into purchase agreements with an aggregate purchase price of approximately 5000000 by making or committing to make deposits of approximately 370000 in the form of cash and letters of credit 

  

nvr enters into bond or letter of credit arrangements with local municipalities government agencies or land developers to collateralize its obligations under various contracts nvr had approximately 27141 of contingent obligations under such agreements as of december 31 2003 nvr believes it will fulfill its obligations under the related contracts and does not anticipate any losses under these bonds or letters of credit 

  

in the normal course of business nvr’s mortgage banking segment enters into contractual commitments to extend credit to buyers of singlefamily homes with fixed expiration dates the commitments 

  

become effective when the borrowers “lockin” a specified interest rate within time frames established by nvr all mortgagors are evaluated for credit worthiness prior to the extension of the commitment to mitigate the effect of the interest rate risk inherent in providing rate lock commitments to borrowers nvr enters into optional or mandatory delivery forward sale contracts to sell whole loans and mortgagebacked securities to brokerdealers the forward sale contracts lock in an interest rate and price for the sale of loans similar to the specific rate lock commitments classified as derivatives both the rate lock commitments to borrowers and the forward sale contracts to brokerdealers are undesignated derivatives and accordingly are marked to market through earnings at december 31 2003 there were contractual commitments to extend credit to borrowers aggregating 180341 and open forward delivery sale contracts aggregating 263533 

  

contractual obligations 

  

our fixed noncancelable obligations as of december 31 2003 were as follows 

  

        

critical accounting policies 

  

general 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods nvr continually evaluates the estimates it uses to prepare the consolidated financial statements and updates those estimates as necessary in general management’s estimates are based on historical experience on information from third party professionals and other various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances actual results could differ materially from those estimates made by management 

  

homebuilding inventory 

  

the carrying value of inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market value cost of lots and completed and uncompleted housing units represent the accumulated actual cost thereof field construction supervisors’ salaries and related direct overhead expenses are included in inventory costs interest costs are not capitalized into inventory upon settlement the cost of the units is expensed on a specific identification basis cost of manufacturing materials is determined on a firstin firstout basis recoverability and impairment if any is primarily evaluated by analyzing sales of comparable assets management believes that its accounting policy is designed to properly assess the carrying value of homebuilding inventory 

  

variable interest entities 

  

financial accounting standards board interpretation no 46 “fin 46” consolidation of variable interest entities requires the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity to consolidate that entity the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is the party that absorbs a majority of the variable interest entity’s expected losses receives a majority of the entity’s expected residual returns or both as a result of ownership contractual or other financial interests in the entity the methodology used to evaluate whether nvr is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity requires substantial management judgment and estimates these judgments and estimates involve assigning probabilities to various estimated cash flow possibilities relative to the variable interest entity’s expected profits and losses and the cash flows associated with changes in the fair value of finished lots under contract the estimates used by management to assess probabilities of various cash flows must be considered in the context that nvr is not in the land development business does not possess any inhouse expertise relative to the land development business and that nvr does not have access to the books and records of most of the development entities evaluated as a variable interest entity although management believes that its accounting policy is designed to properly assess nvr’s primary beneficiary status relative to its involvement with variable interest entities changes to the probabilities and the cash flow possibilities used in nvr’s evaluation could produce different conclusions regarding nvr’s status or nonstatus as a variable interest entity’s primary beneficiary 

  

contract land deposits 

  

nvr purchases finished lots under fixed price purchase agreements that require deposits that may be forfeited if nvr fails to perform under the contract the deposits are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percentage of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots nvr maintains an allowance for losses on contract land deposits that it believes is sufficient to provide for losses in the existing contract land deposit portfolio the allowance reflects management’s judgment of the present loss exposure at the end of the reporting period considering market and economic conditions sales absorption and profitability within specific communities and terms of the various contracts although nvr considers the allowance for losses on contract land deposits reflected on the december 31 2003 balance sheet to be adequate there can be no assurance that this allowance will prove to be adequate over time to cover losses due to unanticipated adverse changes in the economy or other events adversely affecting specific markets or the homebuilding industry 

  

intangible assets 

  

reorganization value in excess of identifiable assets “excess reorg value” and goodwill are no longer subject to amortization upon the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets “fas 142” rather excess reorg value and goodwill are subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fairvalue based test nvr continually evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate that the remaining value of excess reorg value and goodwill may not be recoverable at december 31 2003 management believes that excess reorg value and goodwill were not impaired this conclusion is based on management’s judgment considering such factors as nvr’s history of operating success nvr’s well recognized brand names and the significant positions held in the markets in which nvr operates however changes in strategy or adverse changes in market conditions could impact this judgment and require an impairment loss to be recognized for the amount that the carrying value of excess reorg value andor goodwill exceeds their fair value 

  

warrantyproduct liability accruals 

  

warranty and product liability accruals are established to provide for estimated future expenses as a result of construction and product defects product recalls and litigation incidental to nvr’s business liability estimates are determined based on management judgment considering such factors as historical experience the likely current cost of corrective action manufacturers’ and subcontractors’ participation in sharing the cost of corrective action consultations with third party experts such as engineers and discussions with our general counsel and other outside counsel retained to handle specific product liability cases although nvr considers the warranty and product liability accrual reflected on the december 31 2003 balance sheet see note 10 to be adequate there can be no assurance that this accrual will prove to be adequate over time to cover losses due to increased costs for material and labor the inability or refusal of manufacturers or subcontractors to financially participate in corrective action unanticipated adverse legal settlements or other unanticipated changes to the assumptions used to estimate the warranty and product liability accrual

see risk factors previously discussed 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

  

market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates nvr’s market risk arises from interest rate risk inherent in its financial instruments interest rate risk is the possibility that changes in interest rates will cause unfavorable changes in net income or in the value of interest ratesensitive assets liabilities and commitments lower interest rates tend to increase demand for mortgage loans for home purchasers while higher interest rates make it more difficult for potential borrowers to purchase residential properties and to qualify for mortgage loans nvr has no market rate sensitive instruments held for speculative or trading purposes 

  

nvr’s mortgage banking segment is exposed to interest rate risk as it relates to its lending activities the mortgage banking segment originates mortgage loans which are either sold through optional or mandatory forward delivery contracts into the secondary markets all of the mortgage banking segment’s loan portfolio is held for sale and subject to forward sale commitments nvr also sells substantially all of its mortgage servicing rights on a servicing released basis 

  

nvr’s homebuilding segment generates operating liquidity and acquires capital assets through fixedrate and variablerate debt the homebuilding segment’s primary variablerate debt is a working capital revolving credit facility that currently provides for unsecured borrowings up to 150000 subject to certain borrowing base limitations the working capital credit facility expires in august 2007 and outstanding amounts bear interest at the election of nvr based on the type of borrowing and other criteria set forth in the facility the weighted average interest rate for the amounts outstanding under the facility was 27 during 2003 there were no amounts outstanding under the working capital revolving credit facility at december 31 2003 at december 31 2003 there were no borrowing base limitations reducing the amount available to nvr for borrowings 

  

nvrm generates operating liquidity primarily through the mortgage warehouse facility which currently has a borrowing limit of 175000 the interest rate under the mortgage warehouse facility is either i the london interbank offering rate “libor” plus 125 or ii 125 to the extent that nvrm provides compensating balances the weightedaverage interest rate for amounts outstanding under the mortgage warehouse facility was 18 during 2003 mortgage loans and gestation mortgagebacked securities collateralize the mortgage warehouse facility borrowings the mortgage warehouse facility is annually renewable and currently expires in august 2004 there was 53340 outstanding under the mortgage warehouse facility at december 31 2003 

  

the mortgage warehouse facility agreement includes among other items restrictions on nvrm incurring additional borrowings and making intercompany dividends and tax payments in addition nvrm is required to maintain a minimum net worth of 14000 at december 31 2003 borrowing base limitations reduced the amount available to nvrm for borrowings to approximately 87600 

  

nvrm currently has available an aggregate of 50000 of borrowing capacity in an uncommitted gestation and repurchase agreement amounts outstanding thereunder accrue interest at various rates tied to the libor rate and are collateralized by gestation mortgagebacked securities and whole loans the uncommitted facility generally requires nvrm to among other items maintain a minimum net worth and limit its level of liabilities in relation to its net worth the weightedaverage interest rates for amounts outstanding under these uncommitted facilities were 18 and 23 during 2003 and 2002 respectively there were no borrowings outstanding under the uncommitted gestation and repurchase agreement at december 31 2003 

  

the following table represents the contractual balances of nvr’s onbalance sheet financial instruments in dollars at the expected maturity dates as well as the fair values of those on balance sheet financial instruments at december 31 2003 the expected maturity categories take into consideration historical and anticipated prepayment speeds as well as actual amortization of principal and does not take into consideration the reinvestment of cash or the refinancing of existing indebtedness because nvr sells all of the mortgage loans it originates into the secondary markets nvr has made the assumption that the portfolio of mortgage loans held for sale will mature in the first year consequently outstanding warehouse borrowings and repurchase facilities are also assumed to mature in the first year

nvr inc “nvr” was formed in 1980 as nvhomes inc nvr operates in two business segments 1 homebuilding and 2 mortgage banking nvr conducts its homebuilding activities directly and its mortgage banking operations primarily through a wholly owned subsidiary nvr mortgage finance inc “nvrm” unless the context otherwise requires references to “nvr” include nvr and its subsidiaries 

  

nvr is one of the largest homebuilders in the united states and in the washington dc and baltimore md metropolitan areas approximately 45 of our home settlements in 2002 occurred in the washington dc and baltimore md metropolitan areas which amounted to 56 of nvr’s 2002 homebuilding revenues nvr’s homebuilding operations include the construction and sale of singlefamily detached homes townhomes and condominium buildings under three tradenames ryan homes nvhomes and fox ridge homes the ryan homes and fox ridge homes products are moderately priced and marketed primarily to firsttime homeowners and firsttime moveup buyers the nvhomes product is marketed primarily to moveup and upscale buyers and is built in the washington dc baltimore md and philadelphia pa metropolitan areas the ryan homes product is built in nineteen metropolitan areas located in maryland virginia west virginia pennsylvania new york north carolina south carolina ohio new jersey delaware and tennessee the fox ridge homes product is built solely in the nashville tn metropolitan area in 2002 the average price of a unit settled by nvr was approximately 268500 

  

nvr is not in the land development business nvr purchases finished lots under option contracts which require deposits that may be forfeited if nvr fails to perform under the contract the deposits are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percentage of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots this lot acquisition strategy reduces the financial requirements and risks associated with direct land ownership and land development nvr generally seeks to maintain control over a supply of lots believed to be suitable to meet its sales objectives for the next 24 to 36 months 

  

in addition to building and selling homes nvr provides a number of mortgagerelated services through its mortgage banking operations which operate in 11 states through office locations in each of nvr’s homebuilding markets nvrm originates mortgage loans predominantly for nvr’s homebuyers nvrm generates revenues primarily from origination fees gains on sales of loans title fees and sales of servicing rights nvrm sells all of the mortgage loans it closes into the secondary markets and also sells substantially all of its originated mortgage servicing rights on a flow basis

nvr and its subcontractors must comply with various federal state and local zoning building environmental advertising and consumer credit statutes rules and regulations as well as other regulations and requirements in connection with its construction and sales activities all of these regulations have increased the cost to produce and market nvr’s products counties and cities in which nvr builds homes have at times declared moratoriums on the issuance of building permits and imposed other restrictions in the areas in which sewage treatment facilities and other public facilities do not reach minimum standards to date restrictive zoning laws and the imposition of moratoriums have not had a material adverse effect on nvr’s construction activities however there is no assurance that such restrictions will not adversely affect nvr in the future 

  

competition and market factors 

  

the housing industry is highly competitive nvr competes with numerous homebuilders of varying size ranging from local to national in scope some of whom have greater financial resources than nvr nvr also faces competition from the home resale market nvr’s homebuilding operations compete primarily on the basis of price location design quality service and reputation nvr historically has been one of the market leaders in each of the markets where nvr builds homes 

  

the housing industry is cyclical and is affected by consumer confidence levels prevailing economic conditions and interest rates other factors that affect the housing industry and the demand for new homes include the availability and increases in the cost of land labor and materials changes in consumer preferences demographic trends and the availability of mortgage finance programs 

  

nvr is dependent upon building material suppliers for a continuous flow of raw materials whenever possible nvr utilizes standard products available from multiple sources such raw materials have been generally available in adequate supply 

  

mortgage banking 

  

nvr provides a number of mortgage related services to its homebuilding customers through its mortgage banking operations the mortgage banking operations of nvr also include separate subsidiaries that broker title insurance and perform title searches in connection with mortgage loan closings for which they receive commissions and fees because nvr originates mortgage loans predominately for nvr’s homebuilding customers nvrm is dependent on nvr’s homebuilding segment in 2002 nvrm closed approximately 10200 loans with an aggregate principal amount of approximately 22 billion 

  

nvrm sells all of the mortgage loans it closes to investors in the secondary markets rather than holding them for investment nvrm is an approved sellerservicer for fnma gnma fhlmc va and fha mortgage loans nvrm sells substantially all originated mortgage servicing rights on a flow basis nvrm’s servicing portfolio was approximately 4443 million in unpaid principal balance of loans serviced at the end of 2002 compared to approximately 223 million at december 31 2001 the year over year increase in the servicing portfolio is the result of nvrm selling its servicing rights on a quarterly basis during 2002 rather than on a monthly basis as was done during 2001 

  

  

competition and market factors 

  

nvrm operates through 15 offices in 11 states nvrm’s main competition comes from national regional and local mortgage bankers mortgage brokers thrifts and banks in each of these markets nvrm competes primarily on the basis of customer service variety of products offered interest rates offered prices of ancillary services and relative financing availability and costs 

  

regulation 

  

nvrm is an approved sellerservicer of fnma gnma fhlmc fha and va mortgage loans and is subject to all of those agencies’ rules and regulations these rules and regulations restrict certain activities of nvrm nvrm is currently eligible and expects to remain eligible to participate in such programs however any significant impairment of its eligibility could have a material adverse impact on its operations in addition nvrm is subject to regulation at the state and federal level with respect to specific origination selling and servicing practices 

  

pipeline 

  

nvrm’s mortgage loans in process which had not closed the “pipeline” at december 31 2002 and 2001 had an aggregate principal balance of 13 billion and 11 billion respectively nvrm anticipates that approximately 20 of its pipeline at december 31 2002 will cancel prior to closing the remaining 80 of the pipeline is expected to close in 2003 

  

employees

 risk factors 

  

our business can be negatively impacted by interest rate movements inflation and other economic factors 

  

our business is affected by the risks generally incident to the residential construction business including 

  

   

   

   

   

high rates of inflation generally affect the homebuilding industry adversely because of their adverse impact on interest rates high interest rates not only increase the cost of borrowed funds to homebuilders but also have a significant effect on housing demand and on the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective purchasers we are also subject to potential volatility in the price of commodities that impact costs of materials used in our homebuilding business increases in prevailing interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations 

  

our financial results also are affected by the risks generally incident to our mortgage banking business including interest rate levels the impact of government regulation of mortgage loan originations and servicing and the need to issue forward commitments to fund and sell mortgage loans our homebuilding customers accounted for almost all of our mortgage banking business in 2002 our mortgage banking business is therefore affected by the volume of our continuing homebuilding operations 

  

our mortgage banking business also is affected by interest rate fluctuations we also may experience marketing losses resulting from daily increases in interest rates to the extent we are unable to match interest rates and amounts on loans we have committed to originate with forward commitments from third parties to purchase such loans we employ procedures designed to mitigate any such potential losses but there can be no assurance that such procedures will be entirely successful increases in interest rates may have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations 

  

  

these factors and thus the homebuilding business have tended to be cyclical in nature any downturn in the national economy or the local economies of the markets in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations in particular approximately 45 of our home settlements during 2002 occurred in the washington dc and baltimore md metropolitan areas which amounted to 56 of nvr’s 2002 homebuilding revenues thus nvr is dependent to a significant extent on the economy and demand for housing in those areas 

  

our inability to secure and control an adequate inventory of lots could adversely impact our operations 

  

the results of our homebuilding operations are dependent upon our continuing ability to control an adequate number of homebuilding lots in desirable locations we have not experienced significant shortages in the supply of lots in our principal markets or difficulty in controlling lots through option contracts in sufficient numbers and in adequate locations to fulfill our business plan and on terms consistent with our past operations there can be no assurance however that an adequate supply of building lots will continue to be available on terms similar to those available in the past or that we will not be required to devote a greater amount of capital to controlling building lots than we have historically although we believe that we will have adequate capital resources and financing to control a sufficient number of building lots to fulfill our current business plan there can be no assurance that our resources and financing will in fact be sufficient to meet our expectations an insufficient supply of building lots in one or more of our markets or our inability to purchase or finance building lots on reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations 

  

inventory risk can be substantial for homebuilders the market value of building lots and housing inventories can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing market conditions in addition inventory carrying costs can be significant and can result in losses in a poorly performing project or market we must in the ordinary course of our business continuously seek and make acquisitions of lots for expansion into new markets as well as for replacement and expansion within our current markets although we employ various measures designed to manage inventory risks there can be no assurance that such measures will be successful in the event of significant changes in economic or market conditions we may dispose of certain subdivision inventories on a bulk or other basis which may result in a loss which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations 

  

our current indebtedness may impact our future operations and our ability to access necessary financing 

  

our homebuilding operations are dependent in part on the availability and cost of working capital financing and may be adversely affected by a shortage or an increase in the cost of such financing we believe that we will be able to meet our needs for working capital financing from cash generated from operations and from our existing or a replacement working capital revolving credit facility if we require working capital greater than that provided by our operations and our credit facility we may be required to seek to increase the amount available under the facility or to obtain alternative financing no assurance can be given that additional or replacement financing will be available on terms that are favorable or acceptable if we are at any time unsuccessful in obtaining sufficient capital to fund our planned homebuilding expenditures we may experience a substantial delay in the completion of any homes then under construction any delay could result in cost increases and could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows 

  

our existing indebtedness contains financial and other restrictive covenants and any future indebtedness may also contain covenants these covenants include limitations on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness pay cash dividends and make distributions make loans and investments enter into transactions with affiliates effect certain asset sales incur certain liens merge or consolidate with any other person or transfer all or substantially all of our properties and assets substantial losses by us or other action or inaction by us or our subsidiaries could result in the violation of one or more of these covenants which could result in decreased liquidity or a default on our indebtedness thereby having a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations 

  

  

our mortgage banking operations are dependent on the availability cost and other terms of mortgage warehouse financing and may be adversely affected by any shortage or increased cost of such financing although we believe that our needs for mortgage warehouse financing will be met by our existing mortgage warehouse arrangements and repurchase agreements no assurance can be given that any additional or replacement financing will be available on terms that are favorable or acceptable our mortgage banking operations are also dependent upon the securitization market for mortgagebacked securities and could be materially adversely affected by any fluctuation or downturn in such market 

  

government regulations and environmental matters can negatively affect our operations 

  

we are subject to various local state and federal statutes ordinances rules and regulations concerning zoning building design construction and similar matters including local regulations that impose restrictive zoning and density requirements in order to limit the number of homes that can eventually be built within the boundaries of a particular area we have from time to time been subject to and may also be subject in the future to periodic delays in our homebuilding projects due to building moratoria in the areas in which we operate changes in regulations that restrict homebuilding activities in one or more of our principal markets could have a material adverse effect on our sales profitability stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations 

  

we are also subject to a variety of local state and federal statutes ordinances rules and regulations concerning the protection of health and the environment we are subject to a variety of environmental conditions that can affect our business and our homebuilding projects the particular environmental laws that apply to any given homebuilding site vary greatly according to the location and environmental condition of the site and the present and former uses of the site and adjoining properties environmental laws and conditions may result in delays cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs or prohibit or severely restrict homebuilding activity in certain environmentally sensitive regions or areas thereby adversely affecting our sales profitability stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations 

  

we are an approved sellerservicer of fnma gnma fhlmc fha and va mortgage loans and are subject to all of those agencies’ rules and regulations any significant impairment of our eligibility to sellservice these loans could have a material adverse impact on our mortgage operations in addition we are subject to regulation at the state and federal level with respect to specific origination selling and servicing practices adverse changes in governmental regulation may have a negative impact on our mortgage loan origination business 

  

we face competition in our housing and mortgage banking operations 

  

the homebuilding industry is highly competitive we compete with numerous homebuilders of varying size ranging from local to national in scope some of whom have greater financial resources than we do we face competition 

  

   

   

   

our homebuilding operations compete primarily on the basis of price location design quality service and reputation historically we have been one of the leading homebuilders in each of the markets where we operate 

  

the mortgage banking industry is also competitive our main competition comes from other national regional and local mortgage bankers thrifts banks and mortgage brokers in each of these markets our mortgage banking operations compete primarily on the basis of customer service variety of products offered interest rates offered prices of ancillary services and relative financing availability and costs 

  

  

there can be no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully in our homebuilding or mortgage banking operations an inability to effectively compete may have an adverse impact on our sales profitability stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations 

  

a shortage of building materials or labor may adversely impact our operations 

  

the homebuilding business has in the past from time to time experienced material and labor shortages including shortages in insulation drywall certain carpentry work concrete as well as fluctuating lumber prices and supply in addition high employment levels and strong construction market conditions could restrict the labor force available to our subcontractors and us in one or more of our markets while we are not presently experiencing any serious material or labor shortages significant increases in costs resulting from these shortages or delays in construction of homes could have a material adverse effect upon our sales profitability stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations 

  

weatherrelated and other events beyond our control may adversely impact our operations 

  

extreme weather or other events such as hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes forest fires floods terrorist attacks or war may affect our markets our operations and our profitability these events may impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or subcontractors causing us material increases in costs or delays in construction of homes which could have a material adverse effect upon our sales profitability stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations

results of operations for the years ended december 31 2002 2001 and 2000 

  

nvr inc “nvr” operates in two business segments 1 homebuilding and 2 mortgage banking corporate general and administrative expenses are fully allocated to the homebuilding and mortgage banking segments in the information presented below 

  

homebuilding segment 

  

homebuilding revenues for 2002 increased 20 to 3060671 compared to revenues of 2559744 in 2001 the increase in revenues is primarily due to a 10 increase in the number of homes settled to 11368 in 2002 from 10372 in 2001 and to a 9 increase in the average settlement price to 2685 in 2002 from 2460 in 2001 the increase in the number of homes settled is primarily the result of a 13 increase in new orders to 12167 in 2002 from 10782 in 2001 and to an 8 higher backlog at the beginning of 2002 as compared to the beginning of 2001 new orders increased predominately in markets outside the baltimore and washington dc market areas the increase in the average settlement price is primarily attributable to favorable market conditions resulting in price increases in a majority of nvr’s markets and to a 2 increase as a percentage of total settlements in single family detached home settlements which in comparison are generally higher priced than nvr’s single family attached homes 

  

homebuilding revenues for 2001 increased 13 to 2559744 compared to revenues of 2267810 in 2000 the increase in revenues is primarily due to a 10 increase in the average settlement price to 2460 in 2001 from 2246 in 2000 and a 3 increase in the number of homes settled to 10372 in 2001 from 10055 in 2000 the increase in the average settlement price is attributable to price increases in certain of nvr’s markets and to a larger number of settlements of single family detached homes which in comparison are generally higher priced than nvr’s single family attached homes the increase in settlements is a result of a 4 higher backlog at the beginning of the 2001 period as compared to the beginning of the same 2000 period as well as to an increase in new orders new orders for 2001 increased by 5 to 10782 units compared with 10268 units for 2000 the increase in new orders is predominantly in markets outside the baltimore and washington dc market areas 

  

gross profit margins for 2002 increased to 24 compared to 22 for 2001 the increase in gross profit margins is primarily due to favorable market conditions which provided nvr the opportunity to increase selling prices in a majority of its markets and to relatively stable costs for lumber and certain other commodities over this twoyear period gross profit margins for 2001 increased to 22 compared to 19 for 2000 the increase in gross profit margins is due to favorable market conditions which provided nvr the opportunity to increase selling prices in certain of its markets and to a decrease in the cost of lumber and certain other material costs 

  

selling general and administrative expenses “sga” for 2002 increased 48132 or 27 as compared to 2001 and as a percentage of revenues increased to 74 from 70 the increase in sga dollars is primarily attributable to a 23000 increase in certain management incentives an approximate 15000 increase in wages resulting from increases in personnel to support nvr’s continued growth and to the aforementioned increase in revenues sga expenses for 2001 increased 24867 as compared to 2000 and as a percentage of revenues increased to 70 from 68 the increase in sga dollars is primarily attributable to a 15000 increase in wages resulting from increases in personnel to support the companies continued growth and to the aforementioned 13 increase in revenues 

  

backlog units and dollars were 6357 and 1962115 respectively at december 31 2002 compared to backlog units of 5558 and dollars of 1511503 at december 31 2001 the increase in backlog dollars is primarily due to a 14 increase in backlog units at december 31 2002 and to an 11 increase in the average selling price of new orders for the sixmonth period ended december 31 2002 as compared to the same period for 2001 the increase in backlog units is primarily attributable to a 20 

  

increase in new orders for the sixmonth period ended december 31 2002 as compared to the same period for 2001 backlog units and dollars were 5558 and 1511503 respectively at december 31 2001 compared to backlog units of 5148 and dollars of 1318277 at december 31 2000 the increase in backlog dollars is primarily due to an 8 increase in the average selling price for the sixmonth period ended december 31 2001 as compared to the same period for 2000 and to the 8 increase in backlog units at december 31 2001 as compared to december 31 2000 backlog units increased primarily due to a slower backlog turn during 2001 

  

mortgage banking segment 

  

nvr conducts its mortgage banking activity through nvr mortgage finance inc “nvrm” a wholly owned subsidiary beginning in 2000 nvr restructured nvrm to focus solely on serving the homebuilding segment’s customer base by discontinuing nvrm’s retail mortgage origination activities following is a table of financial and statistical data for the three years ended december 31 2002 2001 and 2000 

  

 loan closing volume for the year ended december 31 2002 increased 15 over 2001 the 2002 increase is attributable to a 5 increase in the number of units closed and to a 10 increase in the average loan amount due to the homebuilding segment’s higher average selling prices loan closing volume for the year ended december 31 2001 increased 8 over 2000 the 2001 increase is attributable to a 19 increase in the average loan amount offset by an 11 reduction in units closed due to the discontinuation of retail activity 

  

operating income for the year ended december 31 2002 increased approximately 14600 over 2001 the increase is primarily due to an increase in mortgage banking fees attributable to the aforementioned 15 increase in closed loan volume increased secondary marketing gains and higher revenues per loan secondary marketing gains for the year ended december 31 2002 increased approximately 4000 over 2001 due to a more favorable pricing environment average revenues per loan including origination fees ancillary fees and discount points for 2002 increased by approximately 24 primarily due to a more favorable market environment than that experienced in 2001 the 2001 year was also impacted by approximately 1700 for costs associated with discontinued retail activity which was the primary cause of the overall decrease in general and administrative costs when comparing 2002 to 2001 

  

operating income for the year ended december 31 2001 increased approximately 28100 over 2000 the increase is primarily due to an increase in mortgage banking fees attributable to the aforementioned 8 increase in closed loan volume higher revenues per loan and higher secondary marketing gains average revenues per loan for 2001 increased by approximately 36 over that experienced during 2000 which resulted from replacing less profitable retail loan volume with more profitable builder business and to a more favorable market environment secondary marketing revenue for the year ended december 31 2001 increased approximately 2500 over 2000 due to an improving pricing environment general and administrative expenses were approximately 5600 less in 2001 compared to 2000 this is primarily attributable to nvrm 

  

substantially reducing staff and other related overhead costs due to the restructuring carried out in 2000 a 5726 restructuring and asset impairment charge recorded in the first quarter of 2000 also impacted operating income in 2000 the restructuring plan was substantially completed during the second quarter of 2000 a detail of the costs comprising the total charge incurred in the first quarter of 2000 is as follows 

  

 during 2002 approximately 48 of the noncancelable office and equipment lease accrual was reversed to the segment’s operating income due to the termination of certain leases during 2001 and 2000 approximately 797 and 863 respectively in severance and lease costs were applied against the restructuring accrual approximately 81 of the restructuring accrual established at march 31 2000 remains at december 31 2002 and solely relates to accrued lease costs 

  

seasonality 

  

overall nvr does not experience material seasonal fluctuations in sales settlements or loan closings 

  

effective tax rate 

  

nvr’s consolidated effective tax rates were 382 400 and 407 in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively the reduction of the effective tax rate over the threeyear period is primarily due to higher taxable income relative to nvr’s permanent differences primarily the amortization of reorganization value in excess of amounts allocable to identifiable assets in 2000 and 2001 and nondeductible compensation in january 2002 nvr amended one of its longterm cash incentive plans requiring executive officers to defer receipt of payments due under the plan until separation of service with nvr the effect of this amendment converted compensation expensed prior to january 1 2002 from a permanent tax difference to a temporary tax difference producing an approximate 7800 deferred tax benefit 

  

recent accounting pronouncements 

  

in april 2002 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 145 “rescission of fasb statements no 4 44 and 64 amendment of fasb statement no 13 and technical corrections” that among other things rescinded sfas no 4 “reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt” with the rescission of sfas no 4 the early extinguishment of debt generally will no longer be classified as an extraordinary item for financial statement presentation purposes the provision is effective for fiscal years beginning after may 15 2002 nvr does not anticipate that the adoption of sfas no 145 will have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations 

  

in june 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 146 “accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities” which replaces emerging issues task force issue no 943 “liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring” the new standard requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan the statement is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after december 31 2002 nvr does not anticipate that the adoption of sfas no 145 will have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations 

  

  

in december 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 148 “accounting for stockbased compensation – transition and disclosure” which amended sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” the new standard provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stockbased employee compensation additionally the statement amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 123 to require prominent disclosures in the annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stockbased employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results this statement is effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after december 15 2002 in compliance with sfas no 148 nvr has elected to continue to follow the intrinsic value method in accounting for its stockbased employee compensation arrangement as defined by accounting principles board opinion “apb” no 25 accounting for stock issued to employee  and has made the applicable disclosures in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

in january 2003 the fasb issued fasb interpretation “fin” no 46 “consolidation of variable interest entities”  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 51 “consolidated financial statements” fin no 46 explains how to identify variable interest entities and how an enterprise assesses its interests in a variable interest entity to decide whether to consolidate that entity this interpretation requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks among parties involved fin no 46 is effective immediately for variable interest entities created after january 31 2003 and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date the interpretation applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june 15 2003 to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february 1 2003 nvr does not anticipate that the adoption of fin no 46 will have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations

on april 14 1998 nvr completed an offering under the shelf registration statement for 145000 of senior notes due 2005 the “senior notes” resulting in aggregate net proceeds to nvr of approximately 142800 after fees and expenses the senior notes mature on june 1 2005 and bear interest at 8 payable semiannually on june 1 and december 1 of each year commencing june 1 1998 the senior notes are senior unsecured obligations of nvr ranking equally in right of payment with nvr’s other existing and future unsecured indebtedness the senior notes are redeemable at the option of the company in whole or in part at any time on or after june 1 2003 at redemption prices ranging from 104 of par on june 1 2003 to par at their maturity date on june 1 2005 

  

during 2000 nvr purchased in the open market an aggregate of 30000 in principal amount of the senior notes the senior notes were purchased at par with no material gain or loss resulting from the transaction there is an aggregate of 115000 of senior notes outstanding at december 31 2002 

  

on march 14 2002 nvr successfully completed a solicitation of consents from holders of its senior notes to amend the indenture governing the senior notes in march 2002 nvr paid to each holder of the senior notes who provided consent an amount equal to 20 of the principal amount of such holder’s senior notes the amendment to the indenture allowed nvr to repurchase up to an aggregate 100000 of its capital stock in addition to that otherwise provided under nvr’s indenture in one or more open market andor privately negotiated transactions through june 1 2003 nvr had fully utilized the 100000 for its intended purpose during 2002 

  

nvr expects that it will from time to time repurchase additional shares of its common stock pursuant to repurchase authorizations by the board of directors and subject to the restrictions contained within nvr’s debt agreements during 2002 nvr fully utilized the 300000 nvr common stock repurchase authorization approved by the board of directors in january 2002 in november 2002 the board of directors approved the repurchase of up to an aggregate of 150000 of nvr’s common stock in one or more open market andor privately negotiated transactions through january 31 2003 nvr has repurchased shares of its common stock at an aggregate purchase price of approximately 71000 pursuant to the 150000 repurchase authorization 

  

cash flows 

  

as shown in nvr’s consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended december 31 2002 nvr’s operating activities provided cash of 381216 for this period the cash was provided primarily by homebuilding operations and by the utilization of a tax benefit of approximately 101000 as a result of stock option exercises this tax benefit is recorded directly to equity and reduced estimated tax payments during the year cash was used for entering into contract land deposits with developers to acquire control of finished lots under lot option contracts and for increasing homebuilding inventory 

  

net cash used by investing activities was 3963 for the year ended december 31 2002 primarily due to capital spending partially offset by proceeds from the sale of mortgage servicing rights 

  

net cash used for financing activities was 373019 for the year ended december 31 2002 nvr purchased approximately 1200000 shares of its common stock in 2002 for an aggregate purchase price of 362399 in addition to the aforementioned share repurchases nvr’s rabbi trust which holds the investments for the deferred compensation plan purchased 170732 shares of nvr’s common stock at an aggregate purchase price of 37469 during 2002 these shares purchased by the rabbi trust are recorded in nvr’s treasury stock account until such shares are vested under the respective compensation plan see note 

  

9 of the consolidated financial statements included in net cash used for financing is an approximate 20000 increase in borrowings under credit lines to finance mortgage loan inventory by nvr’s mortgage banking segment 

  

at december 31 2002 the homebuilding and mortgage banking segments had restricted cash of 6268 and 2150 respectively which includes certain customer deposits mortgagor tax insurance completion escrows and other amounts collected at closing which relates to mortgage loans held for sale and to home sales 

  

nvr believes that internally generated cash and borrowings available under credit facilities will be sufficient to satisfy near and longer term cash requirements for working capital and debt service in both its homebuilding and mortgage banking operations 

  

critical accounting policies 

  

general 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods nvr continually evaluates the estimates it uses to prepare the consolidated financial statements and updates those estimates as necessary in general management’s estimates are based on historical experience on information from third party professionals and other various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances actual results could differ materially from those estimates made by management 

  

homebuilding inventory 

  

the carrying value of inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market value cost of lots and completed and uncompleted housing units represent the accumulated actual cost thereof field construction supervisors’ salaries and related direct overhead expenses are included in inventory costs interest costs are not capitalized into inventory upon settlement the cost of the units is expensed on a specific identification basis cost of manufacturing materials is determined on a firstin firstout basis recoverability and impairment if any is primarily evaluated by analyzing sales of comparable assets management believes that its accounting policy is designed to properly assess the carrying value of homebuilding inventory 

  

contract land deposits 

  

nvr purchases finished lots under option contracts that require deposits that may be forfeited if nvr fails to perform under the contract the deposits are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percentage of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots nvr maintains an allowance for losses on contract land deposits that it believes is sufficient to provide for losses in the existing contract land deposit portfolio the allowance reflects management’s judgment of the present loss exposure at the end of the reporting period considering market and economic conditions sales absorption and profitability within specific communities and terms of the various contracts although nvr considers the allowance for losses on contract land deposits reflected on the december 31 2002 balance sheet to be adequate there can be no assurance that this allowance will prove to be adequate over time to cover losses due to unanticipated adverse changes in the economy or other events adversely affecting specific markets or the homebuilding industry 

  

intangible assets 

  

nvr adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets “sfas no 142 during 2002 excess reorganization value in excess of identifiable assets “excess reorg value” and goodwill is no longer subject to amortization rather excess reorg value and goodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fairvalue based test nvr 

  

continually evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate that the remaining value of excess reorg value and goodwill may not be recoverable at december 31 2002 management believes that excess reorg value and goodwill were not impaired this conclusion is based on management’s judgment considering such factors as nvr’s history of operating success nvr’s well recognized brand names and the significant positions held in the markets in which nvr operates however changes in strategy or adverse changes in market conditions could impact this judgment and require an impairment loss to be recognized for the amount that the carrying value of excess reorg value andor goodwill exceeds their fair value 

  

mortgage servicing rights 

  

nvr sells its servicing rights on a flow basis through fixed price servicing sales contracts due to the short period of time the servicing rights are held from one to four months nvr does not amortize the servicing asset since the servicing rights are recorded at the value in the servicing sales contracts there are no impairment issues related to these assets 

  

warrantyproduct liability accruals 

  

warranty and product liability accruals are established to provide for estimated future expenses as a result of construction and product defects product recalls and litigation incidental to nvr’s business liability estimates are determined based on management judgment considering such factors as historical experience the likely current cost of corrective action manufacturers’ and subcontractors’ participation in sharing the cost of corrective action consultations with third party experts such as engineers and discussions with our general counsel and other outside counsel retained to handle specific product liability cases although nvr considers the warranty and product liability accrual reflected on the december 31 2002 balance sheet to be adequate there can be no assurance that this accrual will prove to be adequate over time to cover losses due to increased costs for material and labor the inability or refusal of manufacturers or subcontractors to financially participate in corrective action unanticipated adverse legal settlements or other unanticipated changes to the assumptions used to estimate the warranty and product liability accrual

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk  

  

market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates nvr’s market risk arises from interest rate risk inherent in its financial instruments interest rate risk is the possibility that changes in interest rates will cause unfavorable changes in net income or in the value of interest ratesensitive assets liabilities and commitments lower interest rates tend to increase demand for mortgage loans for home purchasers while higher interest rates make it more difficult for potential borrowers to purchase residential properties and to qualify for mortgage loans nvr has no market rate sensitive instruments held for speculative or trading purposes 

  

nvr’s mortgage banking segment is exposed to interest rate risk as it relates to its lending activities the mortgage banking segment originates mortgage loans which are either sold through optional or mandatory forward delivery contracts into the secondary markets all of the mortgage banking segment’s loan portfolio is held for sale and subject to forward sale commitments nvr also sells predominantly all of its mortgage servicing rights in bulk sales at predetermined prices which significantly reduces the market risk associated with these interest sensitive assets 

  

nvr’s homebuilding segment generates operating liquidity and acquires capital assets through fixedrate and variablerate debt the homebuilding segment’s primary variablerate debt is a working capital revolving credit facility that currently provides for unsecured borrowings up to 135000 subject to certain borrowing base limitations the working capital credit facility expires may 31 2004 and outstanding amounts bear interest at the election of nvr at i the base rate of interest announced by the 

  

working capital credit facility agent or ii 135 above the eurodollar rate the weighted average interest rate for the amounts outstanding under the facility was 32 during 2002 there were no amounts outstanding under the working capital revolving credit facility at december 31 2002 

  

nvrm generates operating liquidity primarily through the mortgage warehouse facility which currently has a borrowing limit of 150000 the interest rate under the mortgage warehouse facility is either i the london interbank offering rate “libor” plus 125 or ii 125 to the extent that nvrm provides compensating balances the weightedaverage interest rate for amounts outstanding under the mortgage warehouse facility was 22 during 2002 mortgage loans and gestation mortgagebacked securities collateralize the mortgage warehouse facility borrowings the mortgage warehouse facility is annually renewable and currently expires august 29 2003 there was 126249 outstanding under the mortgage warehouse facility at december 31 2002 

  

the mortgage warehouse facility agreement includes among other items restrictions on nvrm incurring additional borrowings and making intercompany dividends and tax payments in addition nvrm is required to maintain a minimum net worth of 12000 

  

nvrm from time to time enters into various gestation and repurchase agreements nvrm currently has available an aggregate of 50000 of borrowing capacity in such uncommitted facilities amounts outstanding thereunder accrue interest at various rates tied to the libor rate and are collateralized by gestation mortgagebacked securities and whole loans the uncommitted facilities generally require nvrm to among other items maintain a minimum net worth and limit its level of liabilities in relation to its net worth the weightedaverage interest rates for amounts outstanding under these uncommitted facilities were 23 and 43 during 2002 and 2001 respectively there was 13008 outstanding under these uncommitted facilities at december 31 2002 

  

the following table represents the contractual balances of nvr’s onbalance sheet financial instruments in dollars at the expected maturity dates as well as the fair values of those on balance sheet financial instruments at december 31 2002 the expected maturity categories take into consideration historical and anticipated prepayment speeds as well as actual amortization of principal and does not take into consideration the reinvestment of cash or the refinancing of existing indebtedness because nvr sells all of the mortgage loans it originates into the secondary markets nvr has made the assumption that the portfolio of mortgage loans held for sale will mature in the first year consequently outstanding warehouse borrowings and repurchase facilities are also assumed to mature in the first year

item 1  business
  

general

     nvr inc nvr was formed in 1980 as nvhomes inc nvr operates in two
business segments 1 homebuilding and 2 mortgage banking nvr conducts its
homebuilding activities directly and its mortgage banking operations primarily
through a wholly owned subsidiary nvr mortgage finance inc nvr finance
unless the context otherwise requires references to nvr include nvr and its
subsidiaries

     nvr is one of the largest homebuilders in the united states and in the
washington dc and baltimore maryland metropolitan areas approximately 48
of the number of homes settled during 2001 occurred in the washington dc and
baltimore md metropolitan areas which amounted to 59 of nvrs 2001
homebuilding revenues nvrs homebuilding operations include the construction
and sale of singlefamily detached homes townhomes and condominium buildings
under three tradenames ryan homes nvhomes and fox ridge homes the ryan homes
and fox ridge homes products are moderately priced and marketed primarily to
firsttime homeowners and firsttime moveup buyers the nvhomes product is
marketed primarily to moveup and upscale buyers the ryan homes product is
built in eighteen metropolitan areas located in maryland virginia west
virginia pennsylvania new york north carolina south carolina ohio new
jersey delaware and tennessee the fox ridge homes product is built solely in
the nashville tennessee metropolitan area the nvhomes product is built in the
washington dc baltimore md charlotte nc and philadelphia pa metropolitan
areas in 2001 the average price of a unit settled by nvr was approximately
246000

     nvr is not in the land development business nvr generally seeks to
maintain control over a supply of lots believed to be suitable to meet its sales
objectives for the next 24 to 36 months nvr purchases finished lots under
option contracts which typically require deposits which may be forfeited if nvr
fails to perform under the contract the deposits are in the form of cash or
letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percent of the aggregate
acquisition value of the finished lots this lot acquisition strategy reduces
the financial requirements and risks associated with direct land ownership and
land development

     in addition to building and selling homes nvr provides a number of
mortgagerelated services through its regional mortgage banking operations
which operate in 10 states through office locations in each of nvrs
homebuilding markets nvr finance originates mortgage loans almost exclusively
for nvrs homebuyers

origination fees gains on sales of loans title fees and sales of servicing
rights in 2001 nvrs mortgage banking business closed approximately 9700
loans with an aggregate principal amount of approximately 19 billion nvrs
mortgage banking business sells all of the mortgage loans it closes into the
secondary markets and also sells substantially all of its originated mortgage
servicing rights on a flow basis the mortgage segments servicing portfolio at

     construction

     independent subcontractors under fixedprice contracts perform construction
work on nvrs homes the subcontractors work is performed under the supervision
of nvr employees who monitor quality control nvr uses many independent
subcontractors in its various markets and is not dependent on any single
subcontractor or on a small number of subcontractors

     sales and marketing

     nvrs preferred marketing method is for customers to visit a furnished
model home featuring many builtin options and a landscaped lot the garages of
these model homes are usually converted into temporary sales centers where
alternative facades and floor plans are displayed and designs for other models
are available for review sales representatives are compensated predominantly on
a commission basis

     regulation

     nvr and its subcontractors must comply with various federal state and
local zoning building environmental advertising and consumer credit statutes
rules and regulations as well as other regulations and requirements in
connection with its construction and sales activities all of these regulations
have increased the cost required to market nvrs products counties and cities
in which nvr builds homes have at times declared moratoriums on the issuance of
building permits and imposed other restrictions in the areas in which sewage
treatment facilities and other public facilities do not reach minimum standards
to date restrictive zoning laws and the imposition of moratoriums have not had
a material adverse effect on nvrs construction activities however there is no
assurance that such restrictions will not adversely affect nvr in the future

results of operations for the years ended december 31 2001 2000 and 1999

     nvr inc nvr operates in two business segments 1 homebuilding and
2 mortgage banking corporate general and administrative expenses are fully
allocated to the homebuilding and mortgage banking segments in the information
presented below

homebuilding segment

     homebuilding revenues for 2001 increased 13 to 2559744 compared to
revenues of 2267810 in 2000 the increase in revenues was primarily due to a
10 increase in the average settlement price to 2460 in 2001 from 2246 in
2000 and a 3 increase in the number of homes settled to 10372 in 2001 from
10055 in 2000 the increase in the average settlement price is attributable to
price increases in certain of nvrs markets and to a larger number of
settlements of single family detached homes which in comparison are generally
higher priced than nvrs single family attached homes the increase in
settlements is a result of the higher backlog at the beginning of the 2001
period as compared to the beginning of the same 2000 period as well as to an
increase in new orders new orders for 2001 increased by 5 to 10782 units
compared with 10268 units for 2000 the increase in new orders was

                                       12

predominantly the result of increased sales in markets outside the
baltimorewashington dc area

     homebuilding revenues for 2000 increased 17 to 2267810 compared to
revenues of 1942660 in 1999 the increase in revenues was primarily due to an
8 increase in the number of homes settled to 10055 in 2000 from 9316 in 1999
and to an 8 increase in the average settlement price to 2246 in 2000 from
2077 in 1999 the increase in settlements is a direct result of the
substantially higher backlog at the beginning of the 2000 period as compared to
the beginning of the same 1999 period the increase in the average settlement
price is attributable to price increases in certain of nvrs markets and to a
larger number of settlements of higher priced single family detached homes new
orders for 2000 increased by 6 to 10268 units compared with 9678 units for
1999 the increase in new orders was predominantly the result of increased sales
in markets outside the baltimorewashington dc area

     gross profit margins for 2001 increased to 22 compared to 19 for 2000
the increase in gross profit margins was due to continuing favorable market
conditions which provided nvr the opportunity to increase selling prices in
certain of its markets a decrease in the cost of lumber and certain other
material costs and to nvrs ongoing focus of controlling construction costs
gross profit margins for 2000 increased to 19 compared to 17 for 1999 the
increase in gross profit margins was due to favorable market conditions that
existed in the first half of 2000 which provided nvr the opportunity to
increase selling prices in certain of its markets during that time a decrease
in the cost of lumber and certain other material costs and to nvrs continued
emphasis on controlling construction costs

     selling general and administrative expenses sga for 2001 increased
24867 as compared to 2000 and as a percentage of revenues increased to 70
from 68 the increase in sga dollars is primarily attributable to the
aforementioned increase in revenues and to an increase in personnel to support
the companies continued growth sga expenses for 2000 increased 12446 as
compared to 1999 but as a percentage of revenues decreased to 68 from 70 in
1999 the increase in sga dollars is primarily attributable to the
aforementioned increase in revenues

     backlog units and dollars were 5558 and 1511503 respectively at
december 31 2001 compared to backlog units of 5148 and dollars of 1318277
at december 31 2000 the increase in backlog dollars was primarily due to an 8
increase in the average selling price for the six month period ending december
31 2001 as compared to the same period for 2000 backlog units increased
primarily due to a slower backlog turn during 2001 backlog units and dollars
were 5148 and 1318277 respectively at december 31 2000 compared to
backlog units of 4935 and dollars of 1137332 at december 31 1999 the
increase in backlog dollars and units was primarily due to a 9 increase in new
orders for the sixmonth period ended december 31 2000 compared to the same
1999 period the dollar increase is also due to an 8 increase in the average
selling price comparing the same sixmonth period

mortgage banking segment

     the mortgage banking segment had operating income excluding the
amortization of excess reorganization value and goodwill of 31966 3853 and
14752 for the years ended december 31 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively
total loan closings were 1885395 1749720 and 2911865 for the same
respective years

     the improvement in operating income over both comparative periods was
primarily due to nvrs operational restructuring of the mortgage segment
announced in the first quarter of 2000 and to a lesser extent to a more
favorable pricing environment the operational restructuring specifically
entailed the closure of all of the mortgage segments retail operations to focus
solely on serving nvrs homebuilding operations builder business the
mortgage segments builder business historically has produced higher operating
margins than its other lines of mortgage business the restructuring has
resulted in the mortgage segment capturing an increased percentage of the loans
and title work associated with the growing homebuilding segments customer base
as noted above the homebuilding segments settlements increased to 10372 in
2001 from 10055 in 2000 and 9316 in 1999 also as part of its restructuring
the mortgage segment substantially reduced staffing and related general and
administrative costs

                                       13

     as a result of the 2000 restructuring activities described above nvr
recorded a restructuring and asset impairment charge of 5726 in the first
quarter of 2000 the restructuring plan was substantially completed during the
second quarter of 2000 a detail of the costs comprising the total charge
incurred in the first quarter of 2000 is as follows

           write off of first republic goodwill        2575
           noncancelable office and equipment leases    1480
           asset impairments                            1362
           severance                                      309
                                                       
           total                                       5726
                                                       


     during 2001 and 2000 approximately 797 and 863 respectively in
severance and lease costs were applied against the restructuring reserve
approximately 129 of the restructuring accrual established at march 31 2000
remains at december 31 2001 and primarily relates to accrued lease costs

seasonality

     the results of nvrs homebuilding operations generally reflect the
seasonality of the housing market in the middle atlantic region of the united
states nvr historically has entered into more sales contracts in this region
during the first and second quarters because nvrs mortgage banking operations
have changed their strategic focus to exclusively serve nvrs homebuilding
customers to the extent that homebuilding is affected by seasonality mortgage
banking operations will also be affected

effective tax rate

     nvrs consolidated effective tax rates were 400 407 and 412 in 2001
2000 and 1999 respectively the reduction of the effective tax rate over the
threeyear period is primarily due to higher taxable income relative to nvrs
permanent differences primarily the amortization of reorganization value in
excess of amounts allocable to identifiable assets and nondeductible
compensation in january 2002 nvr amended one of its longterm cash incentive
plans requiring executive officers to defer receipt of payments due under the
plan until separation of service with nvr the effect of this amendment
estimated to produce approximately an 8000 deferred tax benefit for
compensation expensed prior to december 31 2001 will reduce nvrs 2002
effective tax rate below current levels as a result of converting these
compensationrelated permanent tax differences to temporary differences as of
the amendment date

recent accounting pronouncements

     the financial accounting standards board has issued statement of financial
accounting standards sfas no 141 business combinations and sfas no 142
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 141 requires that the purchase
method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june
30 2001 sfas no 142 changes the accounting for goodwill and reorganization
value in excess of amounts allocable to identifiable assets excess
reorganization value from an amortization approach to an impairmentonly
approach management will be performing the impairment test as defined in sfas
no 142 during the first quarter of 2002 but does not expect that nvr will
incur an impairment loss relative to its existing excess reorganization value
and goodwill upon adoption of sfas no 142 on january 1 2002 further nvr will
cease amortizing goodwill and excess reorganization value effective january 1
2002

period the cash was provided primarily by homebuilding operations and used for
increasing homebuilding inventory and making deposits to developers to acquire
control of finished lots under lot option contracts

     net cash provided by investing activities was 15876 for the year ended
december 31 2001 the primary source of cash was the proceeds from the sale of
mortgage servicing rights

restricted cash of 2692 and 2510 respectively which includes certain
customer deposits mortgagor tax insurance completion escrows and other
amounts collected at closing which relates to mortgage loans held for sale and
to home sales

     nvr believes that internally generated cash and borrowings available under
credit facilities will be sufficient to satisfy near and longer term cash
requirements for working capital and debt service in both its homebuilding and
mortgage banking operations



item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk
  

     market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market
prices and interest rates nvrs market risk arises from interest rate risk
inherent in its financial instruments interest rate risk is the possibility
that changes in interest rates will cause unfavorable changes in net income or
in the value of interest ratesensitive assets liabilities and commitments
lower interest rates tend to increase demand for mortgage loans for home
purchasers while higher interest rates make it more difficult for potential
borrowers to purchase residential properties and to qualify for mortgage loans
nvr has no market rate sensitive instruments held for speculative or trading
purposes

     nvrs mortgage banking segment is exposed to interest rate risk as it
relates to its lending activities the mortgage banking segment originates
mortgage loans which are generally sold through optional and mandatory forward
delivery contracts into the secondary markets all of the mortgage banking
segments loan portfolio is held for sale and subject to forward sale
commitments nvr also sells

                                       16

page

predominantly all of its mortgage servicing rights in bulk sales at
predetermined prices which significantly reduces the market risk associated with
these interest sensitive assets

     nvrs homebuilding segment generates operating liquidity and acquires
capital assets through fixedrate and variablerate debt the homebuilding
segments primary variablerate debt is a working capital revolving credit
facility that currently provides for unsecured borrowings up to 85000 subject
to certain borrowing base limitations the working capital credit facility
expires may 31 2004 and outstanding amounts bear interest at the election of
nvr at i the base rate of interest announced by the working capital credit
facility agent or ii 135 above the eurodollar rate the weighted average
interest rate for the amounts outstanding under the facility was 42 for 2001
there were no amounts outstanding under the working capital revolving credit
facility at december 31 2001

     the following table represents the contractual balances of nvrs onbalance
sheet financial instruments in dollars at the expected maturity dates as well
as the fair values of those on balance sheet financial instruments at december
31 2001 the expected maturity categories take into consideration historical
and anticipated prepayment speeds as well as actual amortization of principal
and does not take into consideration the reinvestment of cash or the refinancing
of existing indebtedness because nvr sells all of the mortgage loans it
originates into the secondary markets nvr has made the assumption that the
portfolio of mortgage loans held for sale will mature in the first year
consequently outstanding warehouse borrowings and repurchase facilities are
also assumed to mature in the first year

we have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of nvr inc and
subsidiaries as of december 31 2001 and 2000 and the related consolidated
statements of income shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the years
in the threeyear period ended december 31 2001 these consolidated financial
statements are the responsibility of the companys management our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our audits

we conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the united states of america those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement an audit includes examining on a
test basis evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements an audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation we believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion

in our opinion the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly in all material respects the financial position of nvr inc and
subsidiaries as of december 31 2001 and 2000 and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the threeyear period

         america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
         affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
         contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
         statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
         reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates

         mortgage loans held for sale derivatives and hedging activities

                  in the normal course of business nvrs mortgage segment
         enters into contractual commitments to extend credit to buyers of
         singlefamily homes with fixed expiration dates the commitments become
         effective when the borrowers lockin a specified interest rate within
         time frames established by nvr all mortgagors are evaluated for credit
         worthiness prior to the extension of the commitment market risk arises
         if interest rates move adversely between the time of the lockin of
         rates by the borrower and the sale date of the loan to a brokerdealer
         to mitigate the effect of the interest rate risk inherent in providing
         rate lock commitments to borrowers the company enters into optional
         and mandatory delivery forward sale contracts to sell whole loans and
         mortgagebacked securities to brokerdealers the forward sale
         contracts lock in an interest rate and price for the sale of loans
         similar to the specific rate lock commitments classified as
         derivatives both the rate lock commitments to borrowers and the
         forward sale contracts to brokerdealers are undesignated derivatives
         and accordingly are marked to market through earnings from the time
         nvr funds the rate lock commitments until the loans are delivered into
         the forward sales contracts the forward sales contracts are designated
         as a fair value hedge of the companys closed loan inventory both the
         forward sales contracts and the closed loans are marked to market
         although minimal any hedge ineffectiveness is recorded as a component
         of mortgage banking fees nvr does not engage in speculative or trading
         derivative activities at december 31 2001 there were contractual
         commitments to extend credit to borrowers aggregating 162114 and
         open forward delivery sales contracts aggregating 145269

         servicing rights that will be sold on a flow basis under existing sales
         contracts and are carried at their relative fair value the permanent
         servicing portfolio has a carrying value of zero because the related

     deferred tax assets arise principally as a result of various accruals
required for financial reporting purposes and deferred compensation which are
not currently deductible for tax return purposes

     management believes the company will have sufficient available carrybacks
and future taxable income to make it more likely than not that the net deferred
tax asset will be realized taxable income was approximately 360857 and
282523 for the years ended december 31 2001 and 2000

     sfas no 123 requires companies who continue to apply opinion 25 to account
for their stockbased employee compensation arrangements to provide pro forma
net income and earnings per share as if the fair value based method had been
used to account for compensation cost accordingly pro forma net income and
earnings per share would have been 215609 2263 diluted share 152503
1444 per diluted share and 104122 861 per diluted share for the years
ended december 31 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively if the company had
accounted for its stock based employee compensation arrangements using the fair
value method the 2001 2000 and 1999 effects of applying sfas no 123 for
providing pro forma disclosures are not likely to be representative of the
effects on reported net income and earnings per share for future years because
the number of option grants and the fair value assigned to future grants could
differ

     to minimize the nondeductibility of executive compensation expense due to
the limitations of section 162m of the internal revenue code and still
maintain the ability to competitively compensate the companys executive
officers the company established a deferred compensation plan deferred comp
plan the specific purpose of the deferred comp plan was to establish a
vehicle whereby the executive officers could defer the receipt of compensation
that otherwise would be nondeductible for tax purposes by the company into a
period where the company would realize a tax deduction for the amounts paid the
deferred comp plan is also available to other members of the companys
management group amounts deferred into the deferred comp plan are invested in
nvr common stock and are paid out in a fixed number of shares upon expiration of
the deferral period

     the deferred comp plan trust was funded during the first quarter of 2000
with 305863 nvr shares issued from the companys treasury stock account in
addition the deferred comp plan trust purchased 34840 nvr common shares on the
open market at an aggregate cost of 1606 the compensation deferred was
related to benefits earned by nvr employees under the companys 1994 management
equity incentive plan and the 1996 high performance plan during 2000 3000
shares were distributed from the deferred comp plan during 2001 the deferred
comp plan was funded with 29915 shares of stock obtained from the settlement of
the forward purchase contract in january 2001 and 26337 shares of stock
purchased on the open market at an aggregate cost of 4744 the 2001
contributions were related to benefits earned under the 1996 high performance
plan and the annual incentive plan at december 31 2001 there are 393955
shares held by the deferred comp plan shares held by the deferred comp plan are
treated as outstanding shares in the companys earnings per share calculation

purchases finished lots under option contracts which typically require deposits
which may be forfeited if nvr fails to perform under the contract the deposits
are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a
percent of the aggregate acquisition value of the finished lots this lot
acquisition strategy reduces the financial requirements and risks associated
with direct land ownership and land development at december 31 2001 assuming
that contractual development milestones are met nvr is committed to placing
additional forfeitable deposits with land developers under existing lot option
contracts of approximately 21000

     on a very limited basis nvr also obtains a supply of finished lots using
unconsolidated limited liability land corporations lllcs all lllcs are
structured such that nvr is a noncontrolling limited partner and is at risk
only for the amount invested accordingly such investments are accounted for
under the equity method of accounting nvr is not a borrower guarantor or
obligor on any of the lllcs debt at december 31 2001 nvr had an aggregate
investment of approximately 3500 in lllcs which controlled approximately
1000 lots

     at december 31 2001 nvr was committed to purchase approximately 40
finished lots for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 3200 under
specific performance contracts

     during the ordinary course of operating the mortgage banking and
homebuilding businesses nvr is required to enter into bond or letter of credit
arrangements with local municipalities government agencies or land developers
to collateralize its obligations under various contracts nvr had approximately
26501 includes 17798 for letters of credit as described in note 6a
herein of contingent obligations under such agreements as of december 31 2001
nvr believes it will fulfill its obligations under the related contracts and
does not anticipate any losses under these bonds or letters of credit

normal course of business in the opinion of management and based on advice of
legal counsel this litigation will not have any material adverse effect on the
financial position or results of operations of nvr

its mortgage banking operations to exclusively serve the companys homebuilding
customers the plan specifically entailed the closure of all of the companys
retail operations including all of the retail branches acquired from the
acquisition of first republic acquired in march 1999 this action was consistent
with the companys decision in december 1999 to exit the wholesale mortgage
origination business the companys mortgage banking operation is now solely
focused on serving the companys homebuilding operations the restructuring plan
was substantially completed during the second quarter of 2000

     as a result of the restructuring the company recorded a restructuring and
asset impairment charge of 5726 in the first quarter of 2000 a detail of the
costs comprising the total charge incurred in the first quarter is as follows

     backlog

     backlog units and dollars were 5148 and 13 billion respectively at
december 31 2000 compared to backlog units of 4935 and dollars of 11 billion
at december 31 1999

     construction

     independent subcontractors under fixedprice contracts perform construction
work on nvrs homes  the subcontractors work is performed under the
supervision of nvr employees who monitor quality control  nvr uses many
independent subcontractors in its various markets and is not dependent on any
single subcontractor nor on a small number of subcontractors

     sales and marketing

     nvrs preferred marketing method is for customers to visit a furnished
model home featuring many builtin options and a landscaped lot  the garages of
these model homes are usually converted into temporary sales centers where
alternative facades and floor plans are displayed and designs for other models
are available for review  sales representatives are compensated predominantly
on a commission basis

     regulation

     nvr and its subcontractors must comply with various federal state and
local zoning building environmental advertising and consumer credit statutes
rules and regulations as well as other regulations and requirements in
connection with its construction and sales activities  all of these regulations
have increased the cost required to market nvrs products  counties and cities
in which nvr builds homes have at times declared moratoriums on the issuance of
building permits and imposed other restrictions in the areas in which sewage
treatment facilities and other public facilities do not reach minimum standards
to date restrictive zoning laws and the imposition of moratoriums have not had
a material adverse effect on nvrs construction activities  however there is
no assurance that such restrictions will not adversely affect nvr in the future

levels prevailing economic conditions and interest rates other factors that
affect the housing industry and the demand for new homes include the
availability and increases in the cost of land labor and materials changes in
consumer preferences demographic trends and the availability of mortgage
finance programs

results of operations for the years ended december 31 2000 1999 and 1998

     nvr inc nvr operates in two business segments homebuilding and
mortgage banking corporate general and administrative expenses are fully
allocated to the homebuilding and mortgage banking segments in the information
presented below

homebuilding segment

     homebuilding revenues for 2000 increased 17 to 2267810 compared to
revenues of 1942660 in 1999  the increase in revenues was primarily due to
an 8 increase in the number of homes settled to 10055 in 2000 from 9316 in
1999 and to an 8 increase in the average settlement price to 2246 in 2000
from 2077 in 1999  the increase in settlements is a direct result of the
substantially higher backlog at the beginning of the 2000 period as compared to
the beginning of the same 1999 period the increase in the average settlement
price is attributable to price increases in certain of the companys markets and
to a larger number of settlements of higherpriced single family detached homes
new orders for 2000 increased by 6 to 10268 units compared with 9678 units
for 1999  the increase in new orders was predominantly the result of increased
sales in markets outside the baltimorewashington area

     homebuilding revenues for 1999 increased 29 to 1942660 compared to
revenues of 1504744 in 1998  the increase in revenues was primarily due to a
22 increase in the number of homes settled to 9316 in 1999 from 7622 in 1998
and to a 6 increase in the average settlement price to 2077 in 1999 from
1964 in 1998  the increase in settlements is a direct result of the
substantially higher backlog at the beginning of the 1999 period as compared to
the beginning of the same 1998 period the increase in the average settlement
price is attributable to single family detached units representing a larger
percentage of the total units settled in the current period as compared to the
prior year period and to price increases in certain of nvrs markets  new
orders for 1999 increased by 8 to 9678 units compared with 9000 units for
1998  the increase in new orders was predominantly the result of increased
sales in markets outside the baltimorewashington area

     gross profit margins for 2000 increased to 19 compared to 17 for 1999
the increase in gross profit margins was due to continuing favorable market
conditions which provided nvr the opportunity to increase selling prices in
certain of its markets a decrease in the cost of lumber and certain other
material costs and to nvrs ongoing focus of controlling construction costs
gross profit margins for 1999 increased to 17 compared to 15 for 1998  the
increase in gross profit margins was due to favorable market conditions that
existed in the first half of 1999 which provided nvr the opportunity to
increase selling prices in certain of its markets during that time and to nvrs
continued emphasis on controlling construction costs in addition the company
has increased the sales and settlement pace per community which resulted in a
better leverage of fixed costs

     sga expenses for 2000 increased 12446 as compared to 1999 but as a
percentage of revenues remained the same at 7  the percentage decrease is
primarily attributable to improved operating efficiencies resulting from the
continued favorable market conditions as explained above and the overall larger
revenue base  the increase in sga dollars is also primarily attributable to
the aforementioned increase in revenues  sga expenses for 1999 increased
27433 as compared to 1998 but as a percentage of revenues decreased to 7 in
1999 from 8 in 1998  approximately 15000 of the increase in sga expenses is
due to a net period to period increase for compensation cost attributable to
management incentive plans  the increase in sga dollars is also attributable
to the aforementioned increase in revenues

     backlog units and dollars were 5148 and 1318277 respectively at
december 31 2000 compared to backlog units of 4935 and dollars of 1137332
at december 31 1999  the increase in backlog dollars and units was primarily
due to a 9 increase in new orders for the sixmonth period ended december 31
2000 compared to the same 1999 period  the dollar increase is also due to an 8
increase in the average selling price comparing the same sixmonth periods
backlog units and dollars were 4935 and 1137332

page

respectively at december 31 1999 compared to backlog units of 4573 and
dollars of 958757 at december 31 1998 the increase in backlog dollars and
units was primarily due to a 2 increase in new orders for the sixmonth period
ended december 31 1999 compared to the same 1998 period and to a slower
backlog turn the dollar increase is also due to an 8 increase in the average
selling price comparing the same sixmonth period


mortgage banking segment

   the mortgage banking segment had operating income excluding the amortization
of excess reorganization value and goodwill of 3853 for the year ended
december 31 2000 compared to operating income of 14752 during 1999  during
the first quarter of 2000 nvr formulated a detailed plan to align its mortgage
banking operations to exclusively serve the companys homebuilding customers
the plan specifically entailed the closure of all of the companys retail
operations including all of the retail branches acquired from the acquisition
of first republic mortgage corporation first republic in march 1999  this
action was consistent with the companys decision in december 1999 to exit the
wholesale mortgage origination business  the restructuring plan was
substantially completed during the second quarter of 2000

     as a result of the restructuring the company recorded a restructuring and
asset impairment charge of 5926 in the first quarter of 2000  a detail of the
costs comprising the total charge incurred in the first quarter is as follows


             write off of first republic goodwill          2575
             noncancelable office and equipment leases      1480
             asset impairments                              1362
             severance                                        509
                                                           
             total                                         5926
                                                           

     during 2000 approximately 863 in severance and lease costs were applied
against the restructuring reserve  in addition during the third quarter the
company reversed approximately 200 in restructuring reserves primarily for
unused severance costs  approximately 930 of the restructuring accrual
established at march 31 2000 remains at december 31 2000 and primarily
relates to accrued lease costs

     excluding the restructuring and impairment charges net of reversals
incurred during 2000 operating income was 9579 a decrease of 35 from the
14752 of operating income generated in 1999  this was primarily due to a 40
reduction in loan closings to 1749720 for 2000 compared to 2911865 in loan
closings for 1999

     excluding the results of first republic the mortgage banking segment
generated operating income of 16045 for the year ended december 31 1999
compared to operating income of 17056 during the same period in 1998  total
loan closings were 2911865 and 2717456 during the respective periods of
1999 and 1998  approximately 450178 of the increased loan closing production
was the result of loans originated by first republic  excluding the origination
activity of first republic loan origination activity for 1999 decreased 9
compared to 1998

     mortgage banking fees in 1999 were 48122 compared to 42703 in 1998
representing an increase of  5419 or 13 from the overall 7 increase in
loan closing volume  an increase in builder related and other retail loan
origination activity offset the sharp reduction in wholesale refinance activity
experienced by the company during the second half of 1999  this shift in
product mix had a favorable impact on mortgage banking fees  however due to
increased price competition the company realized lower margins on the sale of
loans  the increased revenues were offset by higher general and administrative
expenses primarily due to ongoing incremental overhead of first republic and to
a lesser extent costs incurred for the implementation of the companys new loan
origination system  in response to declining market conditions the company
commenced a plan to close four of its mortgage origination branches and to exit
the wholesale origination business  as a result of the plan the company
accrued approximately 650 in office closure expenses during the fourth quarter
of 1999

seasonality

     the results of nvrs homebuilding operations generally reflect the
seasonality of the housing market in the middle atlantic region of the united
states nvr historically has entered into more sales contracts in this region
during the first and second quarters because nvrs mortgage banking operations
have changed their strategic focus to exclusively serve the companys
homebuilding customers to the extent that homebuilding is affected by
seasonality mortgage banking operations may also be affected

effective tax rate

     the merger of nvr homes inc and nvr financial services inc into nvr
inc on september 30 1998 allowed nvr to utilize a separate return limitation
year net operating loss srly nol generated by nvrs previously owned savings
and loan institution nvr savings bank as a result nvr realized a 3300 tax
benefit during 1998 the use of the srly nol coupled with higher taxable income
relative to fixed permanent differences reduced nvrs 1998 effective tax rate

excess of loan sale proceeds over cash expended to close mortgage loans with
customers

mortgage banking operations



item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk
  

     market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market
prices and interest rates nvrs market risk arises from interest rate risk
inherent in its financial instruments interest rate risk is the possibility
that changes in interest rates will cause unfavorable changes in net income or
in the value of interest ratesensitive assets liabilities and commitments
lower interest rates tend to increase demand for mortgage loans for home
purchasers while higher interest rates make it more difficult for potential
borrowers to purchase residential properties and to qualify for mortgage loans
nvr has no market rate sensitive instruments held for speculative or trading
purposes

                                       13

     nvrs mortgage banking segment is exposed to interest rate risk as it
relates to its lending activities the mortgage banking segment originates
mortgage loans which are generally sold through optional and mandatory forward
delivery contracts into the secondary markets substantially all of the mortgage
banking segments loan portfolio is held for sale and subject to forward sale
commitments nvr also sells substantially all the mortgage servicing rights in
bulk sales at predetermined prices which significantly reduces the market risk
associated with these interest sensitive assets

     in the normal course of business nvr also enters into contractual
commitments involving financial instruments with offbalance sheet risk these
financial instruments include commitments to extend mortgage loans to customers
and forward contracts to sell mortgagebacked securities to brokerdealers
these instruments involve to varying degrees elements of market rate risk in
excess of the amounts recognized in the balance sheet nvr enters into
contractual commitments to extend credit to buyers of singlefamily homes with
fixed expiration dates the commitments become effective when the borrowers
lockin a specified interest rate within time frames established by nvr all
mortgagors are evaluated for credit worthiness prior to the extension of the
commitment market risk arises if interest rates move adversely between the time
of the lockin of rates by the borrower and the sale date to a brokerdealer
this market risk is managed by entering into forward contracts optional and
mandatory to deliver mortgagebacked securities and whole loans at specific
prices and dates to brokerdealers and secondary market investors nvr has
established policies governing which brokerdealers can be used to conduct these
activities market risk with respect to forward contracts arises from changes in
the value of contractual positions due to fluctuations in interest rates nvr
limits its exposure to market risk by monitoring differences between the total
of commitments to customers and loans held for sale and forward contracts with
investors and brokerdealers

     there were mortgage loan commitments aggregating approximately 106969
outstanding at december 31 2000 with a fair value at december 31 2000 of
107457 and open forward delivery contracts to sell loans to third party
investors aggregating approximately 135306 at december 31 2000 with a fair
value at december 31 2000 of 134386

     nvrs homebuilding segment generates operating liquidity and acquires
capital assets through fixedrate and variablerate debt the homebuilding
segments primary variablerate debt is a working capital revolving credit
facility that currently provides for unsecured borrowings up to 60000 subject
to certain borrowing base limitations the working capital credit facility
expires may 31 2003 and outstanding amounts bear interest at the election of
nvr at i the base rate of interest announced by the working capital credit
facility agent or ii 135 above the eurodollar rate the weighted average
interest rates for the amounts outstanding under the facility was 8 for 2000
there were no amounts outstanding under the working capital revolving credit
facility at december 31 2000

     the following table represents contractual balances of nvrs on balance
sheet financial instruments in dollars at the expected maturity dates as well
as the fair values of those on balance sheet financial instruments at december
31 2000 the expected maturity categories take into consideration historical
and anticipated prepayment speeds as well as actual amortization of principal
and does not take into consideration the reinvestment of cash or the refinancing
of existing indebtedness because nvr sells all of the mortgage loans it
originates into the secondary markets nvr has made the assumption that the
portfolio of mortgage loans held for sale will mature in the first year
consequently outstanding warehouse borrowings and repurchase facilities are
also assumed to mature in the first year

     mortgage servicing rights

          mortgage servicing rights are recorded by allocating the total cost of
     acquiring mortgage loans to the mortgage servicing rights and the loans
     without the mortgage servicing rights based on their relative fair
     values

          nvr measures the impairment of the mortgage servicing rights based on
     the lower of cost or fair value  current fair value is determined through
     the discounted present value of estimated future net servicing cash flows
     using a riskbased discount rate and assumptions based upon market
     estimates for future servicing revenues and expenses including prepayment
     expectations servicing costs default rates and interest earnings on
     escrows  for the purposes of evaluating and measuring impairment of the
     mortgage servicing rights they are stratified using the predominant risk
     characteristic of the underlying mortgage loans  nvr has determined that
     the predominant risk characteristic of the underlying mortgage loans is
     interest rate  impairment and subsequent changes in measurement of
     impairment of any individual stratum is recognized through a valuation
     allowance for that stratum  the mortgage servicing rights are amortized to
     general and administrative expense in proportion to and over the period
     of the estimated net servicing income

     assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and such amounts as
     measured by enacted tax rules and regulations

     financial instruments

3   related party transactions

     during 2000 1999 and 1998 nvr purchased at market prices developed
lots from a company that is controlled by a member of the board of directors
those purchases totaled approximately 25000 19000 and 13000 during 2000
1999 and 1998 respectively  nvr expects to purchase the majority of the
remaining lots under contract as of december 31 2000 over the next 18 to 24
months for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 29000

     during the years ended december 31 2000 1999 and 1998 one of the
executive officers of nvr was a partner in a law firm which billed nvr
approximately 560 471 and 441 respectively in fees and expenses for legal
services

4   loan servicing portfolio mortgage loan commitments and offbalance sheet
risk

     at december 31 2000 and 1999 nvr was servicing approximately 3000 and
2700 mortgage loans for various investors with aggregate balances of
approximately 275000 and 222000 respectively

     at december 31 2000 nvr had net capitalized mortgage servicing rights of
1479 which related to approximately 142000 of the aggregate 275000 in
loans serviced  the mortgage servicing rights associated with the remaining
133000 in loans serviced are not subject to capitalization because the loans
were originated and sold prior to nvrs adoption of sfas no 122 on january 1
1995

     nvr assesses the fair value of the capitalized mortgage servicing rights by
stratifying the underlying loans by interest rate  the fair value of the
mortgage servicing rights is then determined through the present value of
estimated future net servicing cash flows using a risk based discount rate and
assumptions based upon market estimates for future servicing revenues and
expenses including prepayment expectations servicing costs default rates and
interest earnings on escrows  the fair value of the capitalized mortgage
servicing rights approximated its book value at december 31 2000 and 1999
respectively

     nvr amortizes the capitalized mortgage servicing rights in proportion to
and over the period of the estimated net servicing income  the amortization
for the periods ending december 31 2000 1999 and 1998

was 260 306 and 484 respectively

     in the normal course of business nvr enters into contractual commitments
involving financial instruments with offbalance sheet risk  these financial
instruments include commitments to extend mortgage loans to customers and
forward contracts to sell mortgagebacked securities to brokerdealers  these
instruments involve to varying degrees elements of credit and market rate risk
in excess of the amounts recognized in the balance sheet

     nvrs exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the
customers is represented by the contractual amount of the commitment for the
mortgage loans  nvr finance uses the same credit policies in making commitments
as it does for onbalance sheet mortgage loans

     there were mortgage loan commitments aggregating approximately 106969 and
120716 outstanding at december 31 2000 and 1999 respectively  the fair
values of mortgage loan commitments were approximately 107457 and 120914 at
december 31 2000 and 1999 respectively  there were open forward delivery
contracts aggregating approximately 135306 and 198131 at december 31 2000
and 1999 respectively  the fair values of open forward delivery contracts were
approximately 134386 and 198181 at december 31 2000 and 1999 respectively

          nvr enters into contractual commitments to extend credit to buyers of
singlefamily homes with fixed expiration dates  the commitments become
effective when the borrowers lockin a specified interest rate within time
frames established by nvr  all mortgagors are evaluated for credit worthiness
prior to the extension of the commitment  market risk arises if interest rates
move adversely between the time of the lockin of rates by the borrower and
the sale date to a brokerdealer  this market risk is managed by entering into
forward contracts as discussed below

     since certain of the commitments are expected to expire without a loan
closing the total contractual amounts do not necessarily represent future cash
requirements  collateral for loans granted is obtained by a first mortgage
security interest in real estate whose appraised values exceed the contractual
amount of the commitment

     nvr enters into optional and mandatory forward delivery contracts to sell
mortgagebacked securities at specific prices and dates to brokerdealers  nvr
has established policies governing which brokerdealers can be used to conduct
these activities  credit risk associated with forward contracts is limited to
the replacement cost of those forward contracts in a gain position and at
december 31 2000 and 1999 there were no such positions  there were no
counterparty default losses on forward contracts in 2000 1999 or 1998  market
risk with respect to forward contracts arises from changes in the value of
contractual positions due to fluctuations in interest rates  nvr limits its
exposure to market risk by monitoring differences between the total of
commitments to customers and loans held for sale and forward contracts with
brokerdealers  in the event nvr has forward delivery contract commitments in
excess of available mortgagebacked securities nvr completes the transaction by
either paying or receiving a fee tofrom the brokerdealer equal to the
increasedecrease in the market value of the forward contract  nvr has no
market risk associated with optional delivery contracts because nvr has the
right but not the obligation to deliver mortgage backed securities to
brokerdealers under these contracts

     the weighted average fair value of grants made during 1999 under director

was 577 iii the expected volatility equaled 4019 and iv the estimated
dividend yield was 0

                                 

     sfas no 123 requires companies who continue to apply opinion 25 to account
for their stockbased employee compensation arrangements to provide pro forma
net income and earnings per share as if the fair value based method had been
used to account for compensation cost  accordingly pro forma net income and
earnings per share would have been 152503 1444 per diluted share 104122
861 per diluted share and 55352 416 per diluted share for the years
ended december 31 2000 1999 and 1998 respectively if the company had
accounted for its stock based employee compensation arrangements using the fair
value method  the 2000 1999 and 1998 effects of applying sfas no 123  for
providing pro forma disclosures are not likely to be representative of the
effects on reported net income and earnings per share for future years because
the number of option grants and the fair value assigned to future grants could
differ

     to minimize the nondeductibility of executive compensation expense due to
the limitations of section 162m of the internal revenue code and still
maintain the ability to competitively compensate the companys executive
officers the company established a deferred compensation plan deferred comp
plan  the specific purpose of the deferred comp plan was to establish a
vehicle whereby the executive officers could defer the receipt of compensation
that otherwise would be nondeductible for tax purposes into a period where the
company would realize a tax deduction for the amounts paid  the deferred comp
plan is also available to other members of the companys management group
amounts deferred into the deferred comp plan are invested in nvr common stock
and are paid out in a fixed number of shares upon expiration of the deferral
period

     the deferred comp plan trust was funded during the first quarter of 2000
with 305863 nvr shares issued from the companys treasury stock account  the
basis for the shares reissued from the treasury was 4725 per share  in
addition the deferred comp plan trust purchased 34840 nvr common shares on the
open market at an aggregate cost of 1606  the compensation deferred was
related to benefits earned by nvr employees under the companys 1994 management
equity incentive plan and the 1996 high performance plan  during the 2000 third
quarter 3000 shares were distributed from the deferred comp plan  there are
337703 shares held by the deferred comp plan at december 31 2000  these
shares are treated as outstanding shares in the earnings per share calculation
for the year ended december 31 2000  subsequent to december 31 2000 the
deferred comp plan was funded with an additional 30000 shares of stock  see
