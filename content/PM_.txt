references to total international market defined as worldwide cigarette and heated tobacco unit volume excluding the united states total industry total market and market shares in this form 10k are our estimates for taxpaid products based on the latest available data from a number of internal and external sources and may in defined instances exclude the peoples republic of china andor our duty free business unless otherwise stated references to total industry total market our shipment volume and our market share performance reflect cigarettes and heated tobacco units 

2020 and 2021 estimates for total industry volume and market share in certain geographies reflect limitations on the availability and accuracy of industry data during pandemicrelated restrictions 

our total shipments including cigarettes and heated tobacco units increased by 22 in 2021 to 7199 billion units we estimate that international industry volumes including cigarettes and heated tobacco units were approximately 50 trillion units in 2021 a 13 increase from 2020 excluding the people’s republic of china “prc” we estimate that international cigarette and heated tobacco unit volume was 26 trillion units in 2021 a 24 increase from 2020 we estimate that our reported share of the international market which is defined as worldwide cigarette and heated tobacco unit volume excluding the united states of america was approximately 143 in 2021 143 in 2020 and 151 in 2019 excluding the prc we estimate that our reported share of the international market was approximately 273 277 and 284 in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively

distribution  sales 

our main types of distribution and sales are tailored to the characteristics of each market and are often used simultaneously 

  

• direct sales and distribution where we have set up our own distribution selling directly to the retailers 

• distribution through independent distributors that often distribute other fastmoving consumer goods and are responsible for distribution in a particular market 

• exclusive zonified distribution where the distributors are dedicated to us in multicategory products distribution and assigned to exclusive territories within a market 

• distribution through national or regional wholesalers that then supply the retail trade 

• our own ecommerce infrastructure for product sales to trade partners and to consumers and 

• our own brand retail infrastructure for our rrp products and accessories for sales to consumers 

  

competition   

  

we are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business we compete primarily on the basis of product quality brand recognition brand loyalty taste rd innovation packaging customer service marketing advertising and retail price and increasingly adult smoker willingness to convert to our rrps in the combustible product category we predominantly sell american blend cigarette brands such as marlboro  lm  parliament philip morris and chesterfield  which are the most popular across many of our markets in the rrp product category we predominantly sell platform 1 devices and heated tobacco units under the iqos brand umbrella we seek to compete in all profitable retail price categories although our brand portfolio is weighted towards the premiumprice category 

the competitive environment and our competitive position can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions erosion of consumer confidence competitors introduction of lowerprice products or innovative products higher tobacco product taxes higher absolute prices and larger gaps between retail price categories and product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate tobacco products and restricts adult consumer access to truthful and nonmisleading information about our rrps competitors in our industry include three large international tobacco companies new market entrants particularly with respect to innovative products several regional and local tobacco companies and in some instances stateowned tobacco enterprises principally in algeria egypt the prc taiwan thailand and vietnam certain new market entrants in the noncombustible product category may alienate consumers from innovative products through inappropriate marketing campaigns messaging and inferior product satisfaction while not relying on scientific substantiation based on appropriate rd protocols and standards the growing use of digital media could increase the speed and extent of the dissemination of inaccurate and misleading information about our rrps all of which could have a mutual adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations 

procurement and raw materials 

  

we purchase tobacco leaf of various types grades and styles throughout the world mostly through independent tobacco suppliers in 2021 we also contracted directly with farmers in several countries including argentina brazil colombia italy pakistan and poland in 2021 direct sourcing from farmers represented approximately 25 of pmi’s global leaf requirements the largest supplies of tobacco leaf are sourced from argentina brazil china italy indonesia mostly for domestic use in kretek products malawi mozambique the philippines turkey and the united states 

we believe that there is an adequate supply of tobacco leaf in the world markets to satisfy our current and anticipated production requirements 

in addition to tobacco leaf we purchase a wide variety of direct materials from a total of approximately 360 suppliers in 2021 our top ten suppliers of direct materials combined represented approximately 60 of our total direct materials purchases the three most significant direct materials that we purchase are printed paper board used in packaging acetate tow used in filter making and fine paper used in the manufacturing of cigarettes and heated tobacco units in addition the adequate supply and procurement of cloves are of particular importance to our indonesian business 

we discuss the details of our supply chain for our rrps in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this annual report on form 10k “item 7” in business environment—reducedrisk products

information called for by this item is hereby incorporated by reference to the paragraphs in item 7 business environment to this annual report on form 10k 

  

other matters 

  

customers 

  

as described in more detail in “ distribution  sales ” above in many of our markets we sell our products to distributors in 2021 sales to a distributor in the european union region and a distributor in the east asia  australia region each amounted to 10 percent or more of our consolidated net revenues see item 8 note 12 segment reporting for more information we believe that none of our business segments is dependent upon a single customer or a few customers the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations in some of our markets particularly in the european union eastern europe and in the east asia  australia regions a loss of a distributor may result in a temporary market disruption 

  

employees 

    

our workforce  at december 31 2021 we employed approximately 69600 people worldwide of 133 different nationalities including fulltime temporary and parttime staff our businesses are subject to a number of laws and regulations relating to our relationship with our employees generally these laws and regulations are specific to the location of each business we engage with legally recognized employee representative bodies and we have collective bargaining agreements in many of the countries in which we operate in addition in accordance with european union requirements we have established a european works council composed of management and elected members of our workforce we believe we maintain good relations with our employees and their representative organizations 

our internal transformation  to be successful in our transformation to a smokefree future we must continue transforming our culture and ways of working align our talent with our business needs and innovate to become a truly consumercentric business to achieve our strategic goals we need to attract retain and motivate the best global talent with the right degree of diversity experience competencies and skills therefore we strive to ensure the development of our existing talent while increasingly recruiting those with the expertise in areas that are new to us such as digital and technical solutions we set the levels of our compensation and benefit programs that we believe are necessary to achieve these goals and remain competitive with other consumer product companies 

oversight and management  our board of directors the board provides oversight of various matters pertaining to our workforce and the compensation and leadership development committee of the board is responsible for executive compensation matters and oversight of the risks and programs related to talent management our code of conduct also known at pmi as the guidebook for success highlights our commitment to ethical business conduct and honesty respect fairness in our ways of working 

inclusion  diversity  at pmi we believe that a diverse workforce and an inclusive culture are strategic priorities which help fuel innovation and business success as part of our commitment to workplace diversity in 2020 our board appointed a chief diversity officer improving gender balance especially in management positions continues to be one of our priorities 

• we set a target of 40 female representation in management positions by the end of 2022 

• we launched a women in leadership program to support our female talents and 

• we were the first multinational company to receive a global equalsalary certification from the equalsalary foundation this achievement is an important building block on the road to creating a more inclusive genderbalanced workplace and continuing our reputation as a top employer 

in recognition of our efforts we were added to the 2021 bloomberg genderequality index for transparency in gender reporting and advancing women’s equity among the 380 companies and 11 sectors who scored at or above the global threshold established by bloomberg 

creation of employee resource groups ergs was another important milestone to further inclusion at pmi we believe these groups are an important platform for building an enhanced sense of belonging visibility and greater understanding of different experiences and dimensions of diversity in our company currently we have established ergs on race and ethnicity lgbtq inclusions gender and disability each erg is sponsored by a member of the pmi senior leadership team to illustrate our strong commitment to inclusion  diversity comes from the top 

our initiatives in response to covid19  since the outbreak of the global covid19 pandemic we have focused on business continuity health and safety of our employees and have rapidly adapted our ways of working to a new environment we have implemented additional safety measures for essential employees in our facilities and offices and continue to pay salaries to those employees who are unable to work due to government restrictions we have enhanced remote work arrangements and digital collaboration and related risk management and to date a large majority of our employees continues to work remotely

based on current regulations compliance with government regulations including environmental regulations has not had and is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations capital expenditures financial position earnings or competitive position 

as discussed in more detail in item 1a risk factors  our financial results could be significantly affected by regulatory initiatives that could result in a significant decrease in demand for our brands more specifically any regulatory requirements that lead to a commoditization of tobacco products or impede adult consumers ability to convert to our rrps as well as any significant increase in the cost of complying with new regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial results

 item 1a risk factors 

    

the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report on form 10k any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business our operating results our financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forwardlooking statements are made in this annual report on form 10k

overall business risks 

we may be unsuccessful in our attempts to introduce reducedrisk products and regulators may not permit the commercialization of these products or the communication of scientifically substantiated information and claims 

our key strategic priorities are to i develop and commercialize products that present less risk of harm to adult smokers who switch to those products versus continued smoking and ii convince and educate current adult smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke to switch to those rrps for our efforts to be successful we must 



we might not succeed in our efforts if we do not succeed but others do or if heatnotburn products are inequitably regulated compared to other rrp categories without regard to the totality of the scientific evidence available for such products we may be at a competitive disadvantage in addition actions of some market entrants such as the inappropriate marketing of evapor products to youth as well as alleged health consequences associated with the use of certain evapor products may unfavorably impact public opinion andor mischaracterize all evapor products or other rrps to consumers regulators and policy makers without regard to the totality of scientific evidence for specific products this may impede our efforts to advocate for the development of sciencebased regulatory frameworks for the development and commercialization of rrps we cannot predict whether regulators will permit the sale andor marketing of rrps with scientifically substantiated information and claims such restrictions could limit the success of our rrps 

the who study group on tobacco product regulation tobreg published their eighth report on the scientific basis of tobacco product regulation in may 2021 the report is based on a review of scientific evidence related to novel and emerging nicotine and tobacco products such as electronic nicotine delivery systems ends electronic nonnicotine delivery systems ennds and heated tobacco products htps on a number of scientific topics the report concludes by making a number of policy recommendations on htps and ends that if implemented could restrict both the availability of these products and the access to accurate information about them in august 2021 the who fctc secretariat published two reports to the ninth session of the conference of the parties cop of the fctc which are not materially different from the who study group report 

prior to cop 9 that took place in november 2021 the who and the who fctc secretariat published two reports on novel and emerging tobacco products the reports were noted by cop 9 and related substantive discussions and decisions were deferred to cop 10 currently scheduled for 2023 it is not possible to predict whether or to what extent measures recommended by the whos reports will be implemented as the reports are not binding to the who member states 

additionally any claims regardless of merit challenging our research and clinical data available to date may impact the development of sciencebased regulatory frameworks for the commercialization of the rrp category and the commercialization of the rrp category in general 

our rrps and commercial activities for these products are designed for and directed toward current adult smokers and users of nicotinecontaining products and not for nonsmokers or youth we put significant effort in place to restrict access of our products to nonsmokers or youth nevertheless technological regulatory andor commercial setbacks might prevent us from delivering necessary infrastructure required to fulfill our commitment of having 100 of our rrp device portfolio equipped with “age verification”technology and device activation features by 2023 

if nonetheless there is a significant usage of our products or competitive products among youth or nonsmokers even in situations over which we have no control our credibility may suffer and our efforts to advocate for the development of sciencebased regulatory frameworks for the commercialization of rrps may be significantly impacted 

moreover the fda’s premarket tobacco product and modified risk tobacco product authorizations of a version of our platform 1 product are subject to strict marketing reporting and other requirements although we have received these product authorizations from the fda there is no guarantee that the product will remain authorized for sale in the us particularly if there is a significant uptake in youth or nonsmoker initiation 

the financial and business performance of our reducedrisk products is less predictable than our cigarette business 

our rrps are novel products in a new category and the pace at which adult smokers adopt them may vary depending on the competitive regulatory fiscal and cultural environment and other factors in a specific market there may be periods of accelerated growth and periods of slower growth for these products the timing and drivers of which may be more difficult for us to predict versus our mature cigarette business the impact of this lower predictability on our projected results for a specific period may be significant particularly during the early stages of this new product category during the covid19 pandemic and as a result of unpredictability due to shortage of key components in our supply chain 

we may be unsuccessful in our efforts to differentiate reducedrisk products and cigarettes with respect to taxation 

to date we have been largely successful in demonstrating to regulators that our rrps are not cigarettes due to the absence of combustion and as such they are generally taxed either as a separate category or as other tobacco products which typically yields more favorable tax rates than cigarettes nevertheless we are unable to predict whether regulators will be issuing new regulations where rrp will be equally taxed in line with other tobacco products such as ordinary cigarettes however if we cease to be successful in these efforts rrp unit margins may be materially adversely affected 

consumption of taxpaid cigarettes continues to decline in many of our markets 

this decline is due to multiple factors including increased taxes and pricing governmental actions the diminishing social acceptance of smoking and health concerns competition continuing economic and geopolitical uncertainty and the continuing prevalence of illicit products these factors and their potential consequences are discussed more fully below and in item 7 business environment  a continuous decline in the consumption of cigarettes could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability 

cigarettes are subject to substantial taxes significant increases in cigaretterelated taxes have been proposed or enacted and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted in numerous jurisdictions these tax increases may disproportionately affect our profitability and make us less competitive versus certain of our competitors 

tax regimes including excise taxes sales taxes and import duties can disproportionately affect the retail price of cigarettes versus other combustible tobacco products or disproportionately affect the relative retail price of our cigarette brands versus cigarette brands manufactured by certain of our competitors because our portfolio is weighted toward the premiumprice cigarette category tax regimes based on sales price can place us at a competitive disadvantage in certain markets furthermore our volume and profitability may be adversely affected in these markets 

in addition increases in cigarette taxes are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on our sales of cigarettes due to resulting lower consumption levels a shift in sales from manufactured cigarettes to other combustible tobacco products and from the premiumprice to the midprice or lowprice cigarette categories where we may be underrepresented from local sales to legal crossborder purchases of lower price products or to illicit products such as contraband counterfeit and illicit whites 

our business faces significant governmental action aimed at increasing regulatory requirements with the goal of reducing or preventing the use of tobacco products 

governmental actions combined with the diminishing social acceptance of smoking and private actions to restrict smoking have resulted in reduced industry volumes for our products in many of our markets and we expect that such factors will continue to reduce consumption levels and will increase downtrading and the risk of counterfeiting contraband illicit whites and legal crossborder purchases significant regulatory developments will continue to take place over the next few years in most of our markets driven principally by the world health organizations framework convention on tobacco control the fctc since it came into force in 2005 the fctc has led to increased efforts by tobacco control advocates and public health organizations to promote increasingly restrictive regulatory measures on the marketing and sale of tobacco products to adult smokers regulatory initiatives that have been proposed introduced or enacted by governmental authorities in various jurisdictions include 















our financial results could be materially affected by regulatory initiatives resulting in a significant decrease in demand for our brands more specifically requirements that lead to a commoditization of tobacco products or impede adult consumers ability to convert to our rrps as well as any significant increase in the cost of complying with new regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

changes in the earnings mix and changes in tax laws may result in significant variability in our effective tax rates our ability to receive payments from foreign subsidiaries or to repatriate royalties and dividends could be restricted by local country currency exchange controls and other regulations 

we are subject to income tax laws in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions the new administration resulting from the 2020 us presidential and congressional elections could lead to changes in the us tax system including significant increases in the us corporate income tax rate and the minimum tax rate on certain earnings of foreign subsidiaries if ultimately enacted into law such changes could have a material adverse impact on our effective tax rate thereby reducing our net earnings further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting project undertaken by the organisation for economic cooperation and development which recommended changes to numerous longstanding tax principles if implemented such changes as well as changes in taxing jurisdictions’ administrative interpretations decisions policies or positions could also have a material adverse impact on our effective tax rate thereby reducing our net earnings in future periods our ability to recover deferred tax assets could be subject to additional uncertainty as a result of such developments furthermore changes in the earnings mix or applicable foreign tax laws may result in significant variability in our effective tax rates 

because we are a us holding company our most significant source of funds is distributions from our nonus subsidiaries certain countries in which we operate have adopted or could institute currency exchange controls and other regulations that limit or prohibit our local subsidiaries ability to convert local currency into us dollars or to make payments outside the country this could subject us to the risks of local currency devaluation and business disruption 

risks related to sourcing of materials products and services 

use of thirdparty resources may negatively impact quality and availability of our products and services and we may be required to replace thirdparty contract manufacturers or service providers with our own resources 

we increasingly rely on thirdparty resources and their subcontractorssuppliers to manufacture some of our products and product parts particularly the electronic devices and accessories and to provide services including to support our finance commercialization and information technology processes while many of these arrangements improve efficiencies and decrease our operating costs they also diminish our direct control such diminished control may have a material adverse effect on the quality and availability of products or services our supply chain and the speed and flexibility in our response to changing market conditions and adult consumer preferences all of which may place us at a competitive disadvantage in addition we may be unable to renew these agreements on satisfactory terms for numerous reasons including government regulations and our costs may increase significantly if we must replace such third parties with our own resources 

government mandated prices production control programs shifts in crops driven by economic conditions and the impact of climate change may increase the cost or reduce the quality of the tobacco and other agricultural products used to manufacture our products 

as with other agricultural commodities the price of tobacco leaf and cloves can be influenced by imbalances in supply and demand and the impacts of natural disasters and pandemics such as covid19 furthermore crop quality may be influenced by variations in weather patterns including those caused by climate change tobacco production in certain countries is subject to a variety of controls including government mandated prices and production control programs changes in the patterns of demand for agricultural products could cause farmers to produce less tobacco or cloves any significant change in tobacco leaf and clove prices quality and quantity could affect our profitability and our business 

risks related to our international operations 

because we have operations in numerous countries our results may be adversely impacted by economic regulatory and political developments natural disasters pandemics or conflicts 

some of the countries in which we operate face the threat of civil unrest and can be subject to regime changes in others nationalization terrorism conflict and the threats of war or acts of war may have a significant impact on the business environment natural disasters pandemics economic political regulatory acts of war or threats of war or other developments could disrupt our supply chain manufacturing capabilities or distribution capabilities and our business continuity plans and other safeguards might not always be effective to fully mitigate their impact in addition such developments could increase costs of our materials and operations and lead to loss of property or equipment that are critical to our business in certain markets and difficulty in staffing and managing our operations all of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations volumes revenue net earnings and profitability we discuss risks associated with the covid19 pandemic below 

in certain markets we are dependent on governmental approvals of various actions such as price changes and failure to obtain such approvals could impair growth of our profitability 

in addition despite our high ethical standards and rigorous controls and compliance procedures aimed at preventing and detecting unlawful conduct given the breadth and scope of our international operations we may not be able to detect all potential improper or unlawful conduct by our employees and partners such improper or unlawful conduct actual or alleged could lead to litigation and regulatory action cause damage to our reputation and that of our brands and result in substantial costs 

our reported results could be adversely affected by unfavorable currency exchange rates and currency fluctuations could impair our competitiveness 

we conduct our business primarily in local currency and for purposes of financial reporting the local currency results are translated into us dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period foreign currencies may fluctuate significantly against the us dollar reducing our net revenues operating income and eps our primary local currency cost bases may be different from our primary currency revenue markets and us dollar fluctuations against various currencies may have disproportionate negative impact on net revenues as compared to our gross profit and operating income margins 

risks related to legal challenges and investigations 

litigation related to tobacco use and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke could substantially reduce our profitability and could severely impair our liquidity 

there is litigation related to tobacco products pending in certain jurisdictions in which we operate damages claimed in some tobaccorelated litigation are significant and in certain cases in brazil canada and nigeria range into the billions of us dollars we anticipate that new cases will continue to be filed the fctc encourages litigation against tobacco product manufacturers it is possible that our consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position could be materially adversely affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation we face various administrative and legal challenges related to certain rrp activities including allegations concerning product classification advertising restrictions corporate communications product coach activities scientific substantiation product liability and unfair competition while we design our programs to comply with relevant regulations we expect these or similar challenges to continue as we expand our efforts to commercialize rrps and to communicate publicly the outcomes of these matters may affect our rrp commercialization and public communication activities and performance in one or more markets also see item 8 note 17 contingencies to our condensed consolidated financial statements for a discussion of pending litigation 

from time to time we are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters 

investigations include allegations of contraband shipments of cigarettes allegations of unlawful pricing activities within certain markets allegations of underpayment of income taxes customs duties andor excise taxes allegations of false and misleading usage of 

descriptors allegations of unlawful advertising and allegations of unlawful labor practices we cannot predict the outcome of those investigations or whether additional investigations may be commenced and it is possible that our business could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome of pending or future investigations see item 8 note 17 contingencies—other litigation and “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—operating results by business segment—business environment—governmental investigations” for a description of certain governmental investigations to which we are subject 

we may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights and disputes relating to intellectual property rights could harm our business 

our intellectual property rights are valuable assets and their protection is important to our business if the steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights globally including through a combination of trademark design patent trade secrets and other intellectual property rights are inadequate or if others infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property rights notwithstanding legal protection our business could be adversely impacted moreover failing to manage our existing andor future intellectual property may place us at a competitive disadvantage intellectual property rights of third parties may limit our ability to commercialize our products or improve product quality in one or more markets competitors or other third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property rights any such claims regardless of merit could divert management’s attention be costly disruptive timeconsuming and unpredictable and expose us to significant litigation costs and damages and impede our ability to manufacture commercialize and improve our products and thus have a material adverse effect on our revenue and our profitability in addition if as a result we are unable to manufacture or sell our rrps or improve their quality in one or more markets our ability to convert adult smokers to our rrps in such markets would be adversely affected see item 8 note 17 contingencies—other litigation to our condensed consolidated financial statements for a description of certain intellectual property proceedings 

risks related to our competitive environment 

we face intense competition and our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations 

we are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business we compete primarily on the basis of product quality brand recognition brand loyalty taste rd innovation packaging customer service marketing advertising and retail price and increasingly adult smoker willingness to convert to our rrps the competitive environment and our competitive position can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions erosion of consumer confidence competitors introduction of lowerprice products or innovative products higher tobacco product taxes higher absolute prices and larger gaps between retail price categories and product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate tobacco products and restricts adult consumer access to truthful and nonmisleading information about our rrps competitors in our industry include three large international tobacco companies new market entrants particularly with respect to innovative products several regional and local tobacco companies and in some instances stateowned tobacco enterprises principally in algeria egypt the prc taiwan thailand and vietnam some competitors have different profit volume and regulatory objectives and some international competitors are susceptible to changes in different currency exchange rates certain new market entrants in the noncombustible product category may alienate consumers from innovative products through inappropriate marketing campaigns messaging and inferior product satisfaction while not relying on scientific substantiation based on appropriate rd protocols and standards the growing use of digital media could increase the speed and extent of the dissemination of inaccurate and misleading information about our rrps all of which could have a mutual adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations 

we may be unable to anticipate changes in adult consumer preferences 

our business is subject to changes in adult consumer preferences which may be influenced by local economic conditions accessibility to our products and availability of accurate information related to our products 

to be successful we must 



in periods of economic uncertainty adult consumers may tend to purchase lowerprice brands and the volume of our premiumprice and midprice brands and our profitability could be materially adversely impacted as a result such downtrading trends may be reinforced by regulation that limits branding communication and product differentiation 

our ability to grow profitability may be limited by our inability to introduce new products enter new markets or improve our margins through higher pricing and improvements in our brand and geographic mix 

our profit growth may be materially adversely impacted if we are unable to introduce new products or enter new markets successfully to raise prices or to improve the proportion of our sales of higher margin products and in higher margin geographies 

we may be unable to expand our brand portfolio through successful acquisitions or the development of strategic business relationships and the intended benefits from our investments may not materialize 

one element of our growth strategy is to expand our brand portfolio and market positions through selective acquisitions and the development of strategic business relationships acquisition and strategic business development opportunities are limited and present risks of failing to achieve efficient and effective integration strategic objectives andor anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings there is no assurance that we will be able to acquire attractive businesses or enter into strategic business relationships on favorable terms ahead of our competitors or that such acquisitions or strategic business development relationships will be accretive to earnings or improve our competitive position in addition we may not have a controlling position in certain strategic investments or relationships which could impact the extent to which the intended financial growth and other benefits from these investments or relationships may ultimately materialize 

our ability to achieve our strategic goals may be impaired if we fail to attract motivate and retain the best global talent and effectively align our organizational design with the goals of our transformation 

to be successful we must continue transforming our culture and ways of working align our talent and organizational design with our increasingly complex business needs and innovate and transform to a consumercentric business we compete for talent including in areas that are new to us such as digital information technology life sciences with companies in the consumer products technology pharmaceutical and other sectors that enjoy greater societal acceptance as a result we may be unable to attract motivate and retain the best global talent with the right degree of diversity experience and skills to achieve our strategic goals 

risks related to the impact of covid19 on our business 

our business results of operations cash flows and financial position may be adversely impacted during the continuation of the covid19 pandemic 

the ongoing covid19 pandemic has created significant societal and economic disruption and resulted in closures of stores factories and offices and restrictions on manufacturing distribution and travel all of which have and will continue to adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial position our business continuity plans and other safeguards may not be effective to mitigate the impact of the pandemic 

an adequate supply chain for our rrp portfolio including the supply of electronic devices is important to our business we work with four electronics manufacturing service providers for the supply of our platform 1 and platform 4 devices and a small number of other providers for other products in our rrp portfolio and related accessories due to the covid19 pandemic the operations of our two main electronic manufacturing service providers were temporarily suspended at different times even though these suspensions did not materially affect our operations if one or more of these service providers were significantly constrained at the same time the supply of the devices could be disrupted although we work closely with these service providers on monitoring their production capability and financial health we cannot guarantee that they will remain capable of meeting their commitments particularly during the covid19 pandemic if they will not the commercialization of our rrps could be adversely affected the production of our rrp portfolio requires various metals and we believe that there is an adequate supply of such metals in the world markets to satisfy our current and anticipated production requirements however some components and materials necessary for the production of our rrps including those for the electronic devices are obtained from single or limited sources and can be subject to industrywide shortages and price fluctuations while we were successful in maintaining adequate supply of such components and materials so far we may not be able to secure such supply going forward particularly during the covid19 pandemic this could negatively impact the commercialization of our rrps 

significant risks to our business during the ongoing covid19 pandemic also include our diminished ability to convert adult smokers to our rrps significant volume declines in our dutyfree business and certain other key markets disruptions or delays in our manufacturing and supply chain including delays and increased costs in the shipment of parts to manufacture our products or for the products themselves increased currency volatility and delays in certain cost saving transformation and restructuring initiatives our business could also be adversely impacted if key personnel or a significant number of employees or business partners become unavailable due to the covid19 outbreak the significant adverse impact of covid19 on the economic or political conditions in markets in which we operate could result in changes to the preferences of our adult consumers and lower demand for our products particularly for our midprice or premiumprice brands 

continuation of the pandemic could disrupt our access to the credit markets or increase our borrowing costs governments may temporarily be unable to focus on the development of sciencebased regulatory frameworks for the development and commercialization of rrps or on the enforcement or implementation of regulations that are significant to our business in addition messaging about the potential negative impacts of the use of our products on covid19 risks may lead to increasingly restrictive regulatory measures on the sale and use of our products negatively impact demand for our products and the willingness of adult consumers to switch to our rrps and adversely impact our efforts to advocate for the development of sciencebased regulatory frameworks for the development and commercialization of rrps all of the aforementioned impacts of the ongoing covid19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our business operations results of operations revenues cash flow and profitability 

the impact of these risks also depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control including the duration and severity of the covid19 pandemic in general and specifically in the jurisdictions in which we operate its recurrence in our key markets actions taken to contain its spread and to mitigate its public health effects and the ultimate economic consequences thereof 

risks related to illicit trade 

we lose revenues as a result of counterfeiting contraband crossborder purchases illicit whites nontaxpaid volume produced by local manufacturers and counterfeiting of our platform 1 device and heated tobacco units 

large quantities of counterfeit cigarettes are sold in the international market we believe that marlboro is the most heavily counterfeited international cigarette brand although we cannot quantify the revenues we lose as a result of this activity in addition our revenues are reduced by contraband legal crossborder purchases illicit whites and nontaxpaid volume produced by local manufacturers our revenues and consumer satisfaction with our platform 1 device and heated tobacco units may be adversely affected by counterfeit products that do not meet our product quality standards and scientific validation procedures 

risks related to cybersecurity and data governance 

the failure of our information systems and systems owned and operated by our business partners to function as intended or their penetration with the intent to corrupt them or our and our business partners failure to adhere to strict data governance and cybersecurity protocols and to comply with privacy laws and regulations could result in business disruption loss of reputation litigation and regulatory action and loss of revenue assets or personal or other confidential data 

we as well as our business partners use information systems to help manage business processes collect and interpret data and communicate internally and externally with employees suppliers consumers customers and others some of these information systems are managed by thirdparty service providers we are continuously evolving our approach to business continuity planning and backups to provide appropriate business resilience particularly in light of the increasing cyber threat landscape nevertheless failure of these systems to function as intended or penetration of these systems and systems owned and operated by our business partners by parties intent on extracting or corrupting information or otherwise disrupting business processes could place us at a competitive disadvantage result in a loss of revenue assets including our intellectual property personal or other sensitive data result in litigation and regulatory action cause damage to our reputation and that of our brands and result in significant remediation and other costs failure to protect personal data respect the rights of data subjects and adhere to strict data governance and cybersecurity protocols could subject us to substantial fines and other legal challenges under regulations such as the eu general data protection regulation as we are increasingly relying on digital platforms in our business and as privacy laws in the jurisdictions in which we do business are introduced or become more stringent the magnitude of these risks is likely to increase 

risks related to the acquisitions of otitopic inc otitopic fertin pharma and vectura group plc now known as vectura group ltd 

as previously disclosed in this form 10k we have acquired fertin pharma ag fertin pharma and vectura group ltd vectura with the fertin pharma acquisition and the vectura acquisition being collectively referred to in these risk factors as the “acquisitions” 

we may be unable to successfully integrate and realize the expected benefits from the acquisitions 

the successful integration of the acquired businesses and their operations into those of our own and our ability to realize the benefits of the acquisitions are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties many of which are not in our control the risks and uncertainties relating to integrating the businesses acquired include among other things i the challenge of integrating complex organizations systems operating procedures industry specific compliance programs technology networks and other assets of the businesses that we acquire and the costs related to such integration efforts ii the possibility that we are unable to gain access to differentiated proprietary technology and pharmaceutical development expertise as anticipated by these acquisitions and thus fail to realize our desired entry into additional smokefree and wellness and healthcare platforms iii the challenge of integrating the cultures and business practices of each of fertin pharma and vectura to our culture and business practices which if not managed correctly could lead to difficulties in retaining key management and other key employees and iv the challenge of achieving a successful integration as a result of our affiliation to our combustible product portfolio in addition even if we are able to successfully integrate the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected furthermore the success of the acquisition also depends on the success of the research and development efforts of fertin pharma and vectura including the ability to obtain regulatory approval for new products and the ability to commercialize or license these new products developed by them moreover our affiliation to its combustible product portfolio may stand in the way of introducing and growing new product categories and may prevent us in being successful in developing a longterm sustainable ecosystem of products in the wellness and healthcare categories 

the businesses that we acquire in the acquisitions may have liabilities that are not known to us 

the businesses that we have acquired in the acquisitions may have liabilities that we were unable to identify or were unable to discover in the course of performing our due diligence investigations during the acquisitions thereof we cannot assure you that the indemnification available to us under the respective acquisition agreements that we have negotiated will be sufficient in amount scope or duration to fully offset the possible liabilities associated with the respective business or property that we will assume upon consummation of each acquisition any such liabilities individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

accounting adjustments related to the acquisitions could adversely affect our financial results 

we have accounted for the completion of the acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting differences between preliminary estimates and the final acquisition accounting may occur and these differences could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements and our future results of operations and financial position in combination with the businesses acquired furthermore given the nature of the assets being acquired in the acquisitions we may not be able to avoid future impairments of those assets which may also have a material impact on our future results of operation and financial position 

pmi fertin pharma and vectura may be subject to uncertainties that could adversely affect our respective businesses and adversely affect the financial results of our combined businesses 

our success following these acquisitions will depend in part upon our ability and the ability of fertin pharma and vectura respectively to maintain respective business relationships uncertainty about the effect of the fertin pharma acquisition and the vectura acquisition on customers suppliers employees and other constituencies of each of fertin pharma and vectura may have a material adverse effect on us andor the businesses that we have acquired with the proposed acquisitions customers suppliers and others who do business with fertin pharma or vectura may delay or defer business decisions decide to terminate modify or renegotiate their relationships or take other actions as a result of our acquisitions of fertin pharma and vectura respectively which could negatively affect the revenues earnings and cash flows of our company or the businesses that we have acquired with these acquisitions if we are unable to maintain the business and operational relationships of fertin pharma andor vectura our financial position results of operations or cash flows upon combining with these companies could be adversely affected

executive summary 

the following executive summary provides the business update and significant highlights from the discussion and analysis that follows 

consolidated operating results 

• net revenues – net revenues of 314 billion for the year ended december 31 2021 increased by 27 billion or 94 from the comparable 2020 amount and were impacted by the effects of the covid19 pandemic particular in 2020 the change in our net revenues from the comparable 2020 amount was driven by the following variances not to scale 

net revenues excluding currency and acquisitions increased by 67 mainly reflecting favorable volumemix primarily driven by higher heated tobacco unit volume notably in the eu particularly germany hungary italy and poland as well as japan russia and ukraine and higher device volume notably in the eu primarily italy and japan partly offset by south korea partially offset by lower cigarette volume mainly in the eu region notably the czech republic france and germany as well as the gcc north africa the philippines russia and ukraine partly offset by india indonesia pmi duty free and turkey and unfavorable cigarette mix primarily in germany japan and russia partially offset by indonesia and pmi duty free and a favorable pricing variance notably driven by the czech republic germany japan kazakhstan the philippines russia and turkey partly offset by australia indonesia poland and ukraine partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the saudi arabia customs assessments of 246 million included in other and further described in the following  diluted earnings per share  discussion 

this net revenue growth reflects the continued strength of iqos  and the recovery of the combustible business in many markets from the low base in 2020 due to the impact of covid19 

net revenues by product category for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 are shown below 

  

net revenues in the other category primarily consist of operating revenues generated from the sale of inhaled therapeutics and oral and intraoral delivery systems resulting from the third quarter 2021 acquisitions of fertin pharma as vectura group plc and otitopic inc 

• diluted earnings per share – the changes in our reported diluted earnings per share “diluted eps” for the year ended december 31 2021 from the comparable 2020 amounts were as follows 



asset impairment and exit costs – during 2020 we recorded pretax asset impairment and exit costs of 149 million representing 124 million net of income tax and a diluted eps charge of 008 per share related to the organizational design optimization plan 

primarily in switzerland during 2021 we recorded pretax asset impairment and exit costs of 216 million representing 181 million net of income tax and a diluted eps charge of 012 per share related to the organizational design optimization plan primarily in switzerland and the product distribution restructuring in south korea the total pretax charges in 2020 and 2021 were included in marketing administration and research costs on the consolidated statements of earnings for further details see item 8 note 19 asset impairment and exit costs  

brazil indirect tax credit  following a final and enforceable decision by the highest court in brazil in october 2020 we recorded a gain of 119 million for tax credits in 2020 79 million net of income tax and 005 per share increase in diluted eps representing overpayments of indirect taxes for the period from march 2012 through december 2019 these tax credits were applied to tax liabilities in brazil during 2021 this amount was included as a reduction in marketing administration and research costs in the consolidated statements of earnings for the year ended december 31 2020 and was included in the operating income of the americas segment an additional amount of overpaid indirect taxes of approximately 90 million is dependent on a potential tax authority challenge 

fair value adjustment for equity security investments – during 2020 we recorded an unfavorable fair value adjustment for our equity security investments of 60 million after tax or 004 per share decrease in diluted eps the fair value adjustment for our equity security investments was included in equity investments and securities incomeloss net 76 million loss and provision for income taxes 16 million benefit on the consolidated statements of earnings in 2020 for further details see item 8 note 4 related parties  equity investments and other 

income taxes – the 2020 tax items that increased our 2020 diluted eps by 006 per share in the table above were due to final us tax regulations under the global intangible lowtaxed income gilti provisions of the internal revenue code for years 2018 and 2019 93 million 

the change in the tax rate that increased our diluted eps by 008 per share in the table above was primarily due to the corporate income tax rate reduction in the philippines enacted in the first quarter of 2021 as well as changes in earnings mix by taxing jurisdiction for further details see item 8 note 11 income taxes  

saudi arabia customs assessment s – in june 2021 the customs appeal committee in riyadh notified our distributors in saudi arabia of its decisions to largely reject their challenges of the saudi arabia customs general authority assessments as described in item 8 note 17 contingencies  on the basis of these decisions and in line with arrangements with the distributors we recorded a pretax charge of 246 million in the second quarter of 2021 representing 215 million net of income tax and a diluted eps charge of 014 per share  the pretax charge was recorded as a reduction of net revenues on the consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended december 31 2021 and was included in the middle east  africa segment results 

asset acquisition cost – in august 2021 we acquired 100 of otitopic inc a us respiratory drug development company with a latestage dry powder inhalation aspirin treatment for acute myocardial infarction we accounted for this transaction as an asset acquisition since the acquired inprocess research and development iprd of the dry powder inhalation aspirin treatment represented substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired at the date of acquisition we determined that the acquired iprd had no alternative future use as a result we recorded a pretax charge of 51 million representing a 003 per share charge to diluted eps to research and development costs within marketing administration and research costs in the consolidated statements of earnings for the year ended december 31 2021 for further details see item 8 note 6 acquisitions  

equity investee ownership dilution – in 2021 our equity method investee medicago inc initiated additional rounds of equity funding in which we did not participate as a result our share of holdings in medicago inc was reduced from approximately 32 to approximately 23 as of december 31 2021 the ownership dilution resulted in a 004 per share favorable impact to diluted eps and income of 55 million to equity investments and securities incomeloss net in the consolidated statements of earnings for the year ended december 31 2021 for further details see item 8 note 17 contingencies  third party guarantees  

currency – the favorable impact of 012 per share during the reporting period primarily results from the fluctuations of the us dollar especially against the euro this favorable currency movement has impacted our profitability across our primary revenue markets and local currency cost bases 

operations – the increase in diluted eps of 071 per share from our operations in the table above was due primarily to the following segments 

• european union favorable volumemix lower manufacturing costs and favorable pricing partially offset by higher marketing administration and research costs 

• middle east  africa favorable pricing favorable volumemix and lower manufacturing costs partially offset by lower 

fees for certain distribution rights and higher marketing administration and research costs 

• eastern europe favorable volumemix lower manufacturing costs favorable pricing and lower marketing administration and research costs 

• east asia  australia favorable pricing and lower manufacturing costs partially offset by higher marketing administration and research costs and 

• americas favorable pricing and lower marketing administration and research costs partially offset by higher manufacturing costs

iqos device supply 

the current global semiconductor shortage has resulted in a tightness in iqos device supply in the second half of 2021 in the fourth quarter of 2021 the iqos device supply situation eased resulting in an improved iqos user growth versus the third quarter we expect an improving iqos device supply situation with a gradual return to an unconstrained iqos user quarterly growth progression however we still do not have full visibility over the full year 2022 

iqos in the united states 

on november 29 2021 an importation ban and ceaseanddesist orders imposed by the us international trade commission itc relating to iqos platform 1 products including consumables and infringing components went into effect as a result iqos is not currently available for sale in the us we have appealed the patent and statutory issues related to the itcs final determination and also have contingency plans underway including domestic production we hope to be able to resume us supply in the first half of 2023 for more details on the itc case and related legal matters please refer to item 8 note 17  contingencies  

the itc decision has no bearing outside the us competitor lawsuits based on the same patent families have repeatedly and universally failed in european courts and the european patent office

revenue recognition  we recognize revenue as performance obligations are satisfied our primary performance obligation is the distribution and sales of cigarettes and reducedrisk products including heatnotburn vapor and oral nicotine products our performance obligations are typically satisfied upon shipment or delivery to our customers the company estimates the cost of sales returns based on historical experience and these estimates are immaterial estimated costs associated with warranty programs for iqos devices are generally provided for in cost of sales in the period the related revenues are recognized based on a number of factors including historical experience product failure rates and warranty policies the transaction price is typically based on the amount billed to the customer and includes estimated variable consideration where applicable such variable consideration is typically not constrained and is estimated based on the most likely amount that pmi expects to be entitled to under the terms of the contracts with customers historical experience of discount or rebate redemption where relevant and the terms of any underlying discount or rebate programs which may change from time to time as the business and product categories evolve 

inventories  our inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions the valuation of inventory also requires us to estimate obsolete and excess inventory we perform regular reviews of our inventory on hand as well as our future purchase commitments with our suppliers considering multiple factors including demand forecasts product life cycle current sales levels pricing strategy and cost trends if our review indicates that inventories of raw materials components or finished products have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or that inventory cost exceeds net realizable value we may be required to make adjustments that will impact the results of operations 

goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets valuation  we test goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events occur that would warrant such review while the company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment for both goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets to determine if it is more likely than not that an impairment exists the company elects to perform the quantitative assessment for our annual impairment analysis the impairment analysis involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit or nonamortizable intangible asset to the carrying value if the carrying value exceeds the fair value goodwill or a nonamortizable intangible asset is considered impaired to determine the fair value of goodwill we primarily use the market approach using earnings multiples of comparable global companies within the tobacco industry supported by a discounted cash flow model at december 31 2021 the carrying value of our goodwill was 67 billion which is related to ten geographical reporting units each of which consists of a group of markets with similar operating and economic characteristics and our 2021 acquisitions the fertin pharma as vectura group plc and otitopic inc acquisitions in 2021 are considered separate operating segments and are accounted for within the other category for additional information see item 8 note 6 acquisitions  the estimated fair value of each of our ten reporting units and additional businesses acquired in 2021 exceeded the carrying value as of december 31 2021 to determine the fair value of nonamortizable intangible assets we primarily use a discounted cash flow model applying the relieffromroyalty method we concluded that the fair value of our nonamortizable intangible assets exceeded the carrying value these discounted cash flow models include management assumptions relevant for forecasting operating cash flows which are subject to changes in business conditions such as volumes and prices costs to produce discount rates and estimated capital needs management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the fair values are estimated and we believe these assumptions are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use since the march 28 2008 spinoff from altria group inc we have not recorded a charge to earnings for an impairment of goodwill or nonamortizable intangible assets 

marketing costs  we incur certain costs to support our products through programs that include advertising marketing consumer engagement and trade promotions the costs of our advertising and marketing programs are expensed in accordance with us gaap recognition of the cost related to our consumer engagement and trade promotion programs contain uncertainties due to the judgment required in estimating the potential performance and compliance for each program for volumebased incentives provided to customers management continually assesses and estimates by customer the likelihood of the customers achieving the specified targets and records the reduction of revenue as the sales are made for other trade promotions management relies on estimated utilization rates that have been developed from historical experience changes in the assumptions used in estimating the cost of any individual marketing program would not result in a material change in our financial position results of operations or operating cash flows 

employee benefit plans  as discussed in item 8 note 13 benefit plans to our consolidated financial statements we provide a range of benefits to our employees and retired employees including pensions postretirement health care and postemployment benefits primarily severance we record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by us gaap these calculations include various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates assumed rates of return on plan assets compensation increases mortality turnover rates and health care cost trend rates we review actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so as permitted by us gaap any effect of the modifications is generally amortized over future periods we believe that the assumptions utilized in calculating our obligations under these plans are reasonable based upon our historical experience and advice from our actuaries 

weightedaverage discount rate assumptions for pension and postretirement plan obligations at december 31 2021 and 2020 are as follows 



we anticipate that assumption changes will decrease 2022 pretax pension and postretirement expense to approximately 152 million as compared with approximately 300 million in 2021 excluding amounts related to employee severance and early retirement programs the anticipated decrease is primarily due to lower amortization of unrecognized actuarial gainslosses of 123 million coupled with lower service cost of 45 million and other movements of 9 million partially offset by higher interest cost of 29 million 

weightedaverage expected rate of return and discount rate assumptions have a significant effect on the amount of expense reported for the employee benefit plans a fiftybasispoint decrease in our discount rate would increase our 2022 pension and postretirement expense by approximately 70 million and a fiftybasispoint increase in our discount rate would decrease our 2022 pension and postretirement expense by approximately 58 million similarly a fiftybasispoint decrease increase in the expected return on plan assets would increase decrease our 2022 pension expense by approximately 43 million 

income taxes  income tax provisions for jurisdictions outside the united states as well as state and local income tax provisions are determined on a separate company basis and the related assets and liabilities are recorded in our consolidated balance sheets 

the extent of our operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions the final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal state and international tax audits in accordance with the authoritative guidance for income taxes we evaluate potential tax exposures and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment an additional charge to expense would result if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 

we are required to assess the likelihood of recovering deferred tax assets against future sources of taxable income if we determine using all available evidence that we do not reach the more likely than not threshold for recovery a valuation allowance is recorded significant judgment is required in determining the need for and amount of valuation allowances for deferred tax assets including estimates of future taxable income in the applicable jurisdictions an d the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies  as applicable 

the effective tax rates used for interim reporting are based on our fullyear geographic earnings mix projections changes in currency exchange rates earnings mix by taxing jurisdiction or future regulatory developments may have an impact on the effective tax rates significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions 

for further details see item 8 note 11 income taxes to our consolidated financial statements 

hedging  as discussed below in “market risk” we use derivative financial instruments principally to reduce exposures to market risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates by creating offsetting exposures for derivative contracts that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged items attributable to the hedged risk is recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings for our other derivatives to which we have elected to apply hedge accounting gains and losses on these derivatives are initially deferred in accumulated other comprehensive losses on the consolidated balance sheet and recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings into the same line item as the impact of the underlying transaction and in the periods when the related hedged transactions are also recognized in operating results if we had elected not to use the hedge accounting provisions gains losses deferred in stockholders’ deficit equity would have been recorded in our net earnings for these derivatives 

fair value of nonmarketable equity securities  for further details see item 8 note 20 deconsolidation of rbh 

contingencies  as discussed in item 8 note 17 contingencies to our consolidated financial statements legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened against us andor our subsidiaries andor our indemnitees in various jurisdictions we and our subsidiaries record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated the variability in pleadings in multiple jurisdictions together with the actual experience of management in litigating claims demonstrate that the monetary relief that may be specified in a lawsuit bears little relevance to the ultimate outcome much of the tobaccorelated litigation is in its early stages and litigation is subject to uncertainty at the present time except as stated otherwise in item 8 note 17 contingencies while it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur after assessing the information available to it i management has not concluded that it is probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending tobaccorelated cases ii management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss for any of the pending tobaccorelated cases and iii accordingly no estimated loss has been accrued in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes in these cases if any legal defense costs are expensed as incurred

operating results by business segment 

business environment 

taxes legislation regulation and other matters regarding the manufacture marketing sale and use of tobacco products 

the tobacco industry and our company face a number of challenges that may adversely affect our business volume results of operations cash flows and financial position these challenges which are discussed below and in “ cautionary factors that may affect future results ” include 

• regulatory restrictions on our products including restrictions on the packaging marketing and sale of tobacco or other nicotinecontaining products that could reduce our competitiveness eliminate our ability to communicate with adult consumers or even ban certain of our products 

• fiscal challenges such as excessive excise tax increases and discriminatory tax structures 

• illicit trade in cigarettes and other tobacco and nicotinecontaining products including counterfeit contraband and socalled “illicit whites” 

• intense competition including from nontax paid volume by certain local manufacturers 

• pending and threatened litigation as discussed in item 8 note 17 contingencies  and 

• governmental investigations 

regulatory restrictions the tobacco industry operates in a highly regulated environment the wellknown risks of smoking have led regulators to impose significant restrictions and high excise taxes on cigarettes 

much of the regulation that shapes the business environment in which we operate is driven by the framework convention on tobacco control the “fctc” of the world health organization the who which entered into force in 2005 the fctc has as its main objective to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation with the purpose of reducing tobacco use to date 182 countries and the european union are parties to the fctc the treaty requires parties to have in place various tobacco control measures and recommends others the fctc governing body the conference of the parties “cop” has also adopted nonbinding guidelines and policy recommendations related to certain articles of the fctc that go beyond the text of the treaty in october 2018 the cop recognized the need for more scientific assessment and improved reporting to define policy on heated tobacco products similar to its previous policy recommendations on ecigarettes the cop invited countries to regulate restrict or prohibit heated tobacco products as appropriate under their national laws 

prior to cop 9 that took place in november 2021 the who and the who fctc secretariat published two reports on novel and emerging tobacco products the reports were noted by cop 9 and related substantive discussions and decisions were deferred to cop 10 currently scheduled for 2023 it is not possible to predict whether or to what extent measures recommended by the whos reports will be implemented as the reports are not binding to the who member states 

we believe that when better alternatives to cigarettes exist the discussion should not be whether these alternatives should be made available to the more than one billion people who smoke today but how fast and within what regulatory framework to maximize their adoption while minimizing unintended use therefore we advocate for regulatory frameworks that recognize a significant difference on a risk continuum between combustible tobacco on the one hand and noncombustible tobacco and other nicotinecontaining products on the other regulation should include measures that will accelerate switching to noncombustible products for example by allowing adult consumers who would not otherwise quit to receive truthful and nonmisleading information about such products to 

enable them to make informed decisions and by applying uniform product standards to enable manufacturers to demonstrate the safety of these products as well as the absence of combustion regulation should also include specific rules for ingredients labeling and consumer communication and should ensure that the public is informed about the health risks of all combustible and noncombustible tobacco and nicotinecontaining products importantly regulation must include measures designed to prevent initiation by youth and nonsmokers we support mandated health warnings minimum age laws restrictions on advertising and public place smoking restrictions we also support regulatory measures that help reduce illicit trade 

certain measures are discussed in more detail below and in the reducedrisk products rrps section 

fiscal challenges excessive and disruptive excise sales and other tax increases and discriminatory tax structures are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on our profitability due to lower consumption and consumer downtrading to nonpremium discount other lowprice or lowtaxed combustible tobacco products such as fine cut tobacco and illicit cigarettes in addition in certain jurisdictions some of our combustible products are subject to tax structures that discriminate against premiumprice products and manufactured cigarettes we believe that such tax policies undermine public health by encouraging consumers to turn to illicit trade and ultimately undercut government revenue objectives disrupt the competitive environment and encourage criminal activity other jurisdictions have imposed or are seeking to impose levies or other taxes specifically on tobacco companies such as taxes on revenues andor profits 

world customs organization developments  in 2020 the world customs organization the “wco” amended the harmonized system nomenclature to introduce dedicated custom codes for novel tobacco and nicotine products including heated tobacco products ecigarettes and other nicotinecontaining products the amendments became effective as of january 1 2022 these amendments require wco member states to transfer products from customs codes in the current nomenclature to the new one these amendments are not expected to significantly impact current customs duty rates 

eu tobacco products directive in april 2014 the eu adopted a significantly revised eu tobacco products directive the tpd which entered into force in may 2016 all member states have adopted laws transposing the tpd the tpd sets forth a comprehensive set of regulatory requirements for tobacco products including 

• health warnings covering 65 of the front and back panels of cigarette packs with an option for member states to further standardize tobacco packaging including the introduction of plain packaging 

• a ban on characterizing flavors in some tobacco products with a transition period for menthol that expired in may 2020 

• security features and tracking and tracing measures that became effective in may 2019 and 

• a framework for the regulation of novel tobacco products and ecigarettes including requirements for health warnings and information leaflets a prohibition on product packaging text related to reduced risk and the introduction of notification requirements or authorization procedures in advance of commercialization 

in may 2021 the european commission published its first report on the application of the tpd the report identifies significant progress made due to the implementation of the tpd and where there is still room for improvement most notably it finds that the eu legislation has enhanced tobacco control contributed to protecting the health of eu citizens by providing member states with strong rules to address the use of tobacco products in the eu the tpd reportedly achieved the 2 reduction target of the impact assessment with decreased smoking prevalence among youth the report also concludes that there is scope for improvement in certain areas such as enforcement at national level assessment of ingredients and a better consideration for novel and emerging products 

in november 2021 the european commission published the implementation roadmap to europes beating cancer plan the plan according to the plan a revision of the tpd is planned for 2024 

eu tobacco excise directive the eu commission is preparing a legislative proposal for the revision of the 2011 eu tobacco excise directive that may include definitions and tax treatment for novel tobacco and nicotinecontaining products including heated tobacco products and ecigarettes the proposal is expected to be finalized and adopted by the eu council in 2023 the adoption of the final proposal by the eu council will require unanimous agreement by all eu member states 

plain packaging and other packaging restrictions plain packaging legislation bans the use of branding logos and colors on packaging other than the brand name and variant that may be printed only in specified locations and in a uniform font to date plain packaging laws have been adopted in certain markets in all of our operating segments including the key markets of australia france saudi arabia and turkey some countries such as canada denmark israel and new zealand adopted plain packaging regulations that apply to all tobacco products including rrps other countries are also considering plain packaging legislation 

some countries have adopted or are considering adopting packaging restrictions that could have an impact similar to plain packaging examples of such restrictions include standardizing the shape and size of packages prohibiting certain colors or the use of certain descriptive phrases on packaging and requiring very large graphic health warnings that leave little space for branding 

restrictions and bans on the use of ingredients the who and others in the public health community have recommended restrictions or total bans on the use of some or all ingredients in tobacco products including menthol broad restrictions and ingredient bans would require us to reformulate our american blend tobacco products and could reduce our ability to differentiate these products in the market in the long term in many countries menthol bans would eliminate the entire category of mentholated tobacco products the european union banned cigarettes and rollyourown tobacco products with characterizing flavors other tobacco products including heated tobacco products are exempted from this flavor ban the eu commission is required to withdraw this exemption for a particular product category if it determines that there is a substantial change of circumstances such as a significant increase of euwide sales volumes in such product category other countries may follow the eu’s approach turkey banned menthol as of may 2020 broader ingredient bans have been adopted by brazil and canada 

bans on display of tobacco products at retail in a number of our markets including but not limited to australia and russia governments have banned the display of tobacco products at the point of sale other countries are considering similar bans 

bans and restrictions on advertising marketing promotions and sponsorships for many years the fctc has called for and countries have imposed partial or total bans on tobacco advertising marketing promotions and sponsorships including bans and restrictions on advertising on radio and television in print and on the internet the fctcs nonbinding guidelines recommend that governments prohibit all forms of communication with adult smokers 

restrictions on product design some members of the public health community are calling for the further standardization of tobacco products by requiring for example that cigarettes have a certain minimum diameter which would amount to a ban on slim cigarettes or requiring the use of standardized filter and cigarette paper designs in addition at its meeting in november 2016 the cop adopted nonbinding guidelines recommending that countries regulate product design features that increase the attractiveness of tobacco products such as the diameter of cigarettes and the use of flavor capsules 

restrictions on public smoking and use of nicotinecontaining products in public the pace and scope of restrictions on the use of our products have increased significantly in most of our markets many countries around the world have adopted or are likely to adopt regulations that restrict or ban smoking and use of nicotinecontaining products in public andor work places restaurants bars and nightclubs some public health groups have called for and some countries regional governments and municipalities have adopted or proposed bans on smoking in outdoor places as well as bans on smoking in cars typically when minors are present and private homes 

other regulatory issues some regulators are considering or in some cases have adopted regulatory measures designed to reduce the supply of tobacco products these include regulations intended to reduce the number of retailers selling tobacco products by for example reducing the overall number of tobacco retail licenses available or banning the sale of tobacco products within specified distances of certain public facilities in addition south africa banned the sale of tobacco products ecigarettes and electronic devices that heat tobacco for several months during the covid19 pandemic the ban which was lifted on august 17 2020 resulted in a significant increase of illicit trade of tobacco products 

in a limited number of markets most notably japan we are dependent on governmental approvals that may limit our pricing flexibility 

the eu singleuse plastics directive which will require tobacco manufacturers and importers to cover the costs of public collection systems for tobacco product filters under extended producer responsibility epr schemes entered into force on july 2 2019 to date some member states transposed the directive into national legislation we expect remaining member states to transpose the eu singleuse plastics directive into national legislation including epr schemes by january 2023 while we cannot predict the impact of this initiative on our business at this time we are monitoring developments in this area 

illicit trade illicit tobacco trade creates a cheap and unregulated supply of tobacco products undermines efforts to reduce smoking prevalence especially among youth damages legitimate businesses and intellectual property rights stimulates organized crime increases corruption and reduces government tax revenue we generally estimate that excluding china and the us illicit trade may account for as much as 12 of global cigarette consumption this includes counterfeit contraband and the persistent problem of “illicit whites” which are cigarettes legally produced in one jurisdiction for the sole purpose of being exported and illegally sold in another jurisdiction where they have no legitimate market currently we estimate that illicit trade in the european union accounted for approximately 8 of total cigarette consumption in 2021 

a number of jurisdictions are considering actions to prevent illicit trade in november 2012 the fctc adopted the protocol to eliminate illicit trade in tobacco products the “protocol” which includes supply chain control measures such as licensing of manufacturers and distributors enforcement of these control measures in free trade zones controls on duty free and internet channels and the implementation of tracking and tracing technologies to date 63 parties including the european union have ratified it the protocol came into force in september 2018 parties must start implementing its provisions in their national legislation in november 2021 the second meeting of the parties to the protocol decided among others to focus on the implementation of a framework for global information sharing to combat illicit tobacco trade and enable the parties to exchange products tracking and tracing information in a secure manner we welcome this decision and expect that other parties will ratify the protocol 

we devote substantial resources to help prevent illicit trade in combustible tobacco products and rrps for example we engage with governments our business partners and other stakeholders to implement effective measures to combat illicit trade and in some instances pursue legal remedies to protect our intellectual property rights 

the tracking and tracing regulations for cigarettes and rollyourown products manufactured or destined for the eu became effective on may 20 2019 the effective date for other tobaccocontaining products including some of our rrps such as heated tobacco units is may 20 2024 while we expect that this regulation will increase our operating expenses we do not expect this increase to be significant 

in 2009 our colombian subsidiaries entered into an investment and cooperation agreement with the national and regional governments of colombia to promote investment in and cooperation on anticontraband and anticounterfeit efforts the agreement provides 200 million in funding over a 20year period to address issues such as combating illegal cigarette trade and increasing the quality and quantity of locallygrown tobacco 

in may 2016 pmi launched pmi impact a global initiative that supports thirdparty projects dedicated to fighting illegal trade and related crimes such as corruption organized criminal networks and money laundering the centerpiece of pmi impact is a council of external independent experts in the fields of law anticorruption and law enforcement the experts are responsible for evaluating and approving funding proposals for pmi impact grants pmi has pledged 100 million to fund projects within pmi impact over three funding rounds 

reducedrisk products rrps   

our approach to rrps we recognize that smoking cigarettes causes serious diseases and that the best way to avoid the harms of smoking is never to start or to quit nevertheless it is predicted that by 2025 the number of smokers will remain largely unchanged from the current estimate of 11 billion despite the considerable efforts to discourage smoking 

cigarettes burn tobacco which produces smoke as a result of the combustion process the smoker inhales various toxic substances in contrast rrps do not burn tobacco and therefore contain significantly lower levels of harmful and potentially harmful constituents hphcs than found in cigarette smoke 

for adult smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke we believe that rrps while not riskfree offer a much better consumer choice accordingly our key strategic priorities are to i to develop and commercialize products that present less risk of harm to adult smokers who switch to those products versus continued smoking and ii educate and convince convince current adult smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke to switch to those products 

we recognize that this transformation from cigarettes to rrps will take time and that the speed of transformation will depend in part upon factors beyond our control such as the willingness of governments regulators and other policy groups to embrace rrps as a desired alternative to continued cigarette smoking for as long as a significant number of adult smokers continues to smoke responsible leadership of the category is critical we aim to maintain our competitive position in the cigarette market through selective investment as a leading international cigarette manufacturer we will continue to accelerate this transformation by using our regulatory and commercial expertise and extensive commercial and distribution infrastructure as an effective platform for the commercialization of our rrps and communication with adult smokers and trade partners about the benefits of switching to our rrps 

while seeking to remain competitive in the cigarette market we are judiciously reallocating resources from cigarettes to rrps and are streamlining our cigarette portfolio 

we have a range of rrps in various stages of development scientific assessment and commercialization we conduct rigorous scientific assessments of our rrp platforms to substantiate that they reduce exposure to hphcs and ultimately that these products 

present are likely to present or have the potential to present less risk of harm to adult smokers who switch to them versus continued smoking we draw upon a team of expert scientists and engineers from a broad spectrum of scientific disciplines and our extensive learnings of adult consumer preferences to develop and assess our rrps our efforts are guided by the following key objectives 

• to develop rrps that adult smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke find to be satisfying alternatives to smoking 

• for those adult smokers our goal is to offer rrps with a scientifically substantiated riskreduction profile that approaches as closely as possible that associated with smoking cessation 

• to substantiate the reduction of risk for the individual adult smoker and the reduction of harm to the population as a whole based on scientific evidence of the highest standard that is made available for scrutiny and review by external independent scientists and relevant regulatory bodies and 

• to advocate for the development of sciencebased regulatory frameworks for the development and commercialization of rrps including the communication of scientifically substantiated information to enable adult smokers to make better consumer choices 

our rrp platforms our product development is based on the elimination of combustion via tobacco heating and other innovative systems which we believe are the most promising path to providing a better consumer choice for those who would otherwise continue to smoke we recognize that no single product will appeal to all adult smokers therefore we are developing a portfolio of products intended to appeal to a variety of distinct adult consumer preferences 

five pmideveloped or improved rrp platforms are in various stages of development and commercialization readiness 

platform 1 uses a precisely controlled heating device incorporating our iqos heatcontrol technology into which a specially designed and proprietary tobacco unit is inserted and heated to generate an aerosol we have conducted a series of clinical studies for this platform the results of which were included in our submission to the us food and drug administration “fda” described below we completed a 66month exposure response study and shared the results with the fda in april 2020 the study showed that for the group that switched to our platform 1 product the eight clinical risk endpoints that were tested as coprimary endpoints in the first sixmonth term moved in the same direction as observed for smoking cessation after 12 months of use of this product in addition we completed an 18month combined chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity study in mice which was ongoing at the time of our fda submission we shared the results with the fda in august 2018 in addition to the original version of platform 1 which relies on a heating technology using a blade a new version of platform 1 is now available using induction all studies referenced above were conducted with the blade version of platform 1 we believe that there is full comparability between the versions therefore the data from these studies remain valid 

platform 2 uses a pressed carbon heat source which when ignited generates a nicotinecontaining aerosol by heating tobacco the results of our pharmacokinetic study that measured the nicotine pharmacokinetic profile as well as subjective effects and of our fiveday reduced exposure study indicate that this platform could be an acceptable substitute for adult smokers who seek an alternative to cigarettes the reduced exposure study results showed a substantial reduction in relevant biomarkers of exposure to the measured hphcs in those who switched to platform 2 compared to those who continued to smoke cigarettes over a fiveday period the sustainability of this reduction as well as changes in clinical risk markers were assessed in a threemonth reduced exposure study which was completed in 2018 we conducted a consumer test of our platform 2 design in the last quarter of 2021 as a result of the feedback from this consumer test the design of our current platform 2 technology has been discontinued we are assessing alternative designs for this consumer segment 

platform 3 provides an aerosol of nicotine salt we have explored two routes for this platform one with electronics and one without and conducted nicotine pharmacokinetic studies with both versions the results of our pharmacokinetic study related to the version without electronics indicate this products potential as an acceptable alternative to continued cigarette smoking in terms of product satisfaction in february 2020 we completed a onemonth product use and adaptation study in adult smokers for the product variant without electronics the results of the study indicated that while during the study period the adult smokers did not fully switch from smoking cigarettes to this platform 3 product on average they used this product on a daily basis and significantly reduced their daily consumption of cigarettes we are working on product modifications to enable switching by those adult smokers who are looking for better alternatives to cigarettes 

platform 4 covers evapor products which are batterypowered devices that produce an aerosol by vaporizing a nicotinecontaining liquid solution in 2020 our evapor products comprised devices with the “coil and wick” technology as well as our evapor mesh technology designed to ensure the consistency and quality of the generated aerosol compared to the products with the “coil and wick” technology recently we discontinued the commercialization of devices with the “coil and wick” technology we conducted a nicotine pharmacokinetic study with respect to products with our evapor mesh technology in 2017 the results of this 

study indicate that these products are an effective means of nicotine delivery while being a satisfying alternative for ecigarette users in march 2019 a sixmonth preclinical study in mice evaluating the impact of ecigarette vapor on the risks of pulmonary and cardiovascular disease compared to cigarette smoke was completed this study did not pertain to a specific product the study demonstrated that ecigarette vapors induce significantly lower biological responses associated with cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases compared with cigarette smoke recently we designed a new consumable for our evapor mesh technology to deliver real tobacco taste satisfaction in an evapor product liquidusing patented technology where flavors and nicotine are extracted directly from the tobacco leaves and captured in a liquid solution without having to add flavoring ingredients this consumable has been commercialized in one market in december 2021 

platform 5 covers modern oral nicotine pouches which consist of white preportioned pouches containing nicotine derived from tobacco users place a pouch between the upper lip and gum and leave it there while the nicotine and taste are being released at the end of the use the user can dispose of the pouch nicotine pouches are inherently smokefree as they are consumed orally and no combustion process occurs during use our nicotine pouches do not contain tobacco instead they contain primarily nicotine flavors and a cellulose substrate the nicotine used in the pouches is of pharmaceuticalgrade like the nicotine used in medicinal products such as gums and inhalers while the flavors are approved for use in food in accordance with the product quality standards for nicotine pouches developed by the swedish institute for standards in 2021 pmi acquired ag snus as well as fertin pharma two companies manufacturing andor marketing nicotine pouches 

we aim to expand our brand portfolio and market positions with additional rrps in addition we are continuing to use our expertise technology and capabilities to explore new growth opportunities beyond our current business including products that do not contain nicotine or tobacco 

after we receive the results of our scientific studies including those mentioned above in accordance with standard scientific practices we share the conclusions in scientific forums and submit them for inclusion in peerreviewed publications 

the research and development expense for our smokefree portfolio accounted for 99 99 and 98 of our total research and development expense for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively the research and development expense for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 is set forth in item 8 note 14 additional information to the consolidated financial statements 

commercialization of rrps we are building a new product category and tailor our commercialization strategy to the characteristics of each specific market we focus our commercialization efforts on consumer retail experience guided consumer trials and customer care and increasingly digital communication programs and ecommerce in order to accelerate switching to our platform 1 products our initial market introductions typically entail onetoone consumer engagement in person or by digital means and device discounts these initial commercialization efforts require substantial investment which we believe will moderate over time and further benefit from the increased use of digital engagement capabilities during the covid19 pandemic we accelerated our investments in and pivot to digital consumer engagement 

as of december 31 2021 pmis smokefree products are available for sale in 71 markets in key cities or nationwide 

in 2014 we introduced our platform 1 product in pilot city launches in nagoya japan and in milan italy since then we have continuously expanded our commercialization activities 

we believe that only a very small percentage of adult smokers who convert to our platform 1 product switch back to cigarettes 

we have integrated the production of our heated tobacco units into a number of our existing manufacturing facilities are progressing with our plans to build manufacturing capacity for our other rrp platforms and continue to optimize our manufacturing infrastructure 

an adequate supply chain for our rrp portfolio including the supply of electronic devices is important to our business we work with four electronics manufacturing service providers for the supply of our platform 1 and platform 4 devices and a small number of other providers for other products in our rrp portfolio and related accessories due to the covid19 pandemic the operations of our two main electronic manufacturing service providers were temporarily suspended at different times even though these suspensions did not materially affect our operations if one or more of these service providers were significantly constrained at the same time the supply of the devices could be disrupted although we work closely with these service providers on monitoring their production capability and financial health we cannot guarantee that they will remain capable of meeting their commitments particularly during the covid19 pandemic if they will not the commercialization of our rrps could be adversely affected the production of our rrp portfolio requires various metals and we believe that there is an adequate supply of such metals in the world markets to satisfy our 

current and anticipated production requirements however some components and materials necessary for the production of our rrps including those for the electronic devices are obtained from single or limited sources and can be subject to industrywide shortages and price fluctuations while we were successful in maintaining adequate supply of such components and materials so far we may not be able to secure such supply going forward particularly during the covid19 pandemic this could negatively impact the commercialization of our rrps 

in addition we are also exposed to a worldwide shortage of semiconductors which continues to put constraints on our device supplies for rrps we believe however that the overall impact of this shortage remains manageable and we have adjusted our device assortments to limit the effect on consumer availability of our rrps 

we discuss product warranties in more detail in item 8 note 5 product warranty  the significance of warranty claims is dependent on a number of factors including device version mix product failure rates logistics and service delivery costs and warranty policies and may increase with the number of devices sold 

product quality may affect consumer acceptance of our rrps 

our nearterm planned commercialization efforts for the other pmideveloped rrp platforms are as follows 

• we started commercializing an improved version of our iqos mesh product in canada corsica croatia the czech republic finland italy ukraine and new zealand under the iqos veev or veev brand names we currently plan to launch this product in additional markets 

• with respect to teeps  our platform 2 product we finalized our improvements to this product and conducted a consumer test in the last quarter of 2021 as a result of the feedback from this consumer test the design of our current platform 2 technology has been discontinued we are assessing alternative designs for this consumer segment 

• following the consumer test conducted in 2020 and the results of the product use and adaptation study described above we are incorporating our learnings into our plans to improve our platform 3 product 

• we launched a platform 5 product in sweden in january 2022 that is a reformulated version of the already commercialized nicotine pouches bearing the shiro brand by our newly acquired affiliate ag snus 

due to the covid19 pandemic certain of these commercialization efforts could be delayed 

rrp regulation and taxation rrps contain nicotine and are not riskfree as we describe in more detail above we support sciencebased regulation and taxation of rrps and believe that regulation and taxation should differentiate between cigarettes and products that present are likely to present or have the potential to present less risk of harm to adult smokers who switch to these products versus continued smoking and should recognize a continuum of risk for tobacco and other nicotinecontaining products regulation as well as industry practices should reflect the fact that youth should not consume nicotine in any form 

some governments have banned or are seeking to ban or severely restrict emerging tobacco and nicotinecontaining products such as our rrps and communication of truthful and nonmisleading information about such products 

these regulations might foreclose or unreasonably restrict adult consumer access even to products that might be shown to be a better consumer choice than continuing to smoke during the covid19 pandemic some governments have been and may continue to be temporarily unable to focus on the development of sciencebased regulatory frameworks for the development and commercialization of rrps or on the enforcement or implementation of regulations that are significant to our business 

we oppose blanket bans and unreasonable restrictions of products that have the potential to present less risk of harm compared to continued smoking by contrast we support regulation that sets clear standards for all rrp categories and propels innovation to benefit adult smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke 

in the united states an established regulatory framework for assessing “modified risk tobacco products” and “new tobacco products” exists under the jurisdiction of the fda we submitted to the fda a modified risk tobacco product application “mrtpa” for our platform 1 product in december 2016 and a premarket tobacco product application “pmta” for our platform 1 product in march 2017 

on april 30 2019 the fda determined that a version of our platform 1 product namely iqos 24 and three related consumables is appropriate for the protection of public health and authorized it for sale in the united states the fda’s decision followed its comprehensive assessment of our pmta on december 7 2020 the fda reached the same determination for the iqos 3 device and authorized that version of our platform 1 product for sale in the united states 

on july 7 2020 the fda determined that the available scientific evidence demonstrates that the issuance of an exposure modification order would be appropriate for the promotion of public health and authorized the marketing of a version of our platform 1 product namely iqos 24 and three related consumables as a modified risk tobacco product the fda authorized the marketing of this product in the us with the following information 

available evidence to date 

• the iqos system heats tobacco but does not burn it 

• this significantly reduces the production of harmful and potentially harmful chemicals 

• scientific studies have shown that switching completely from conventional cigarettes to the iqos system significantly reduces your body’s exposure to harmful or potentially harmful chemicals 

we must request and receive authorization from the fda in order to continue marketing this product with the same modified exposure information after the present order expires in four years from the date of the orders 

on march 18 2021 we submitted to the fda a supplemental mrtpa smrtpa for iqos 3 requesting authorization to market this version of the device as a modified risk tobacco product with reduced exposure information like iqos 24 in june 2021 the fda formally accepted and filed our smrtpa for substantive scientific review and already in may 2021 the fda opened the period for the public to provide comments on our application the public comment period which was initially scheduled to be closed on august 2 2021 was extended on july 20 2021 to provide time for the public to review application materials that were not previously posted by fda the fda closed the comment period for iqos 3 s smrtpa on december 10 2021 

there are two types of mrtp orders the fda may issue a “risk modification” order or an “exposure modification” order we had requested both types of orders for iqos 24 and an initial selection of 3 consumables variants after review the fda determined that the evidence did not support issuing a risk modification order at this time but that it did support issuing an exposure modification order for the product this determination included a finding that issuance of the exposure modification order is expected to benefit the health of the population as a whole 

we look forward to working with the fda to provide any additional information they may require in order to market this product with reduced risk claims 

the fda’s pmta and mrtp orders do not mean that the agency “approved” our platform 1 product these authorizations are subject to strict marketing reporting and other requirements and are not a guarantee that the product will remain authorized particularly if there is a significant uptake in youth or nonsmoker initiation the fda will monitor the marketing of the product 

some states and municipalities in the us have introduced severe restrictions for the sale of certain ecigarettes and tobacco products including those authorized by the fda we believe that such restrictions on fdaauthorized products will not advance public health and will unreasonably limit adult consumer access to products that are shown to be a better alternative to continued smoking 

in march 2020 we requested a clarification from the fda regarding the applicability of its new health warning requirements to our heated tobacco units sold in the united states in june 2021 the fda responded to our letter and requested additional information regarding the applicability of the cigarette health warnings rule to the iqos system and heatsticks  philip morris products sa is committed to providing adult consumers of tobacco products with complete accurate and nonmisleading information regarding the health risks associated with the use of the iqos system and heatsticks  we shared our views with the fda on the applicability of new health warnings to our products in our submission on december 2 2021 

in the us tobacco and nicotinecontaining products that were not commercially marketed as of february 15 2007 are subject to review and authorization by the fda manufacturers of all nonauthorized products currently on the market were required to file a pmta with the fda by september 9 2020 the fda announced on september 9 2020 that it will prioritize enforcement against any tobacco and nicotinecontaining product sold without a pmta on october 5 2021 fda published its final pmta rule in the federal register which is effective november 4 2021 all future applications will have to comply with the requirements in the pmta rule which is substantially similar to the version of the final pmta rule which was posted on advanced federal register on january 19 2021 

fda actions may influence the regulatory approach of other governments 

on september 29 2021 the international trade commission itc issued its final determination fd limited exclusion order leo and cease and desist order cdo the itc upheld the finding of infringement in the id and found a subsequent violation the itc issued a leo prohibiting the importation of infringing tobacco heating articles and components thereof and cease and desist orders against philip morris usa inc and altria client services llc which went into effect at the end of the 60day presidential review period on november 28 2021 we have appealed the patent issues furthermore lawsuits based on the same patent families have been repeatedly and universally rejected in european courts and the european patent office the decision has no bearing outside the united states 

until recently there were no countries with specific product standards for heatnotburn products currently national standards setting minimum quality and safety requirements for such products have been adopted in several countries with technical heatnotburn specifications andor methods for demonstrating the absence of combustion they are mandatory in egypt jordan saudi arabia tunisia the uae uzbekistan and bahrain and voluntary in armenia costa rica indonesia kazakhstan kyrgyzstan russia tajikistan vietnam the uk and ukraine in japan a voluntary standard sets minimum safety requirements for tobacco heating devices we expect other governments to consider similar product standards and encourage making them mandatory 

all eu member states have transposed the eu tobacco products directive including the provisions on novel tobacco products such as heated tobacco units and ecigarettes most of the eu member states require a notification submitted six months before the intended placing on the market of such products while some require premarket authorizations for the introduction of such products to date we have filed a comprehensive dossier summarizing our scientific assessment of our platform 1 product in over 20 member states 

in addition in italy in april 2018 we submitted an application for heets  used with the iqos device requesting regulatory recognition of the reduction of toxic substances and potential risk reduction resulting from switching to this product compared to continued cigarette smoking in january 2019 our application was not granted primarily on the grounds of insufficient data and questions of methodology due to the constraints of the review process we had been unable to supplement the application with all the data we subsequently filed with the fda and to address methodological questions during the review we plan to submit a new application where we will clarify the concerns raised by the decision and further strengthen our application by submitting additional evidence that became available since we submitted our first application consistent with our fda filings we are confident that our evidence supports our application 

on october 31 2019 our australian subsidiary philip morris limited “pml” submitted an application to the scheduling committee of the therapeutic goods administration of australia “tga” seeking to exempt heated tobacco products from being prohibited in australia in august 2020 the tga issued its decision denying the application and stating that it did not present compelling evidence to establish a public health benefit from greater access to nicotine in heated tobacco products 

to date several governmental agencies have published their scientific findings that analyze the harmreduction potential of certain rrps versus continuing smoking including 

in december 2017 at the request of the uk department of health and public health england the uk committee on toxicity published its assessment of the risk of heatnotburn products relative to cigarette smoking this assessment included analysis of scientific data for two heatnotburn products one of which was our platform 1 product the assessment concluded that while still harmful to health compared with the known risks from cigarettes heatnotburn products are probably less harmful subsequently in february 2018 public health england published a report stating that the available evidence suggests that heatnotburn products may be considerably less harmful than cigarettes and more harmful than ecigarettes 

in may 2018 the german federal institute for risk assessment “bfr” published a study on the platform 1 aerosol relative to cigarette smoke using the health canada intense smoking regimen bfr found reductions in selected hphcs in a range of 8099 this publication indicates that significant reductions in the levels of selected toxicants are likely to reduce toxicant exposure which bfr stated might be regarded as a discrete benefit compared to combustible cigarettes 

in may 2018 the dutch national institute for public health and environment “rivm” published a factsheet on novel tobacco products that heat rather than burn tobacco focusing on our platform 1 product rivm analyzed the aerosol generated by our platform 1 product and concluded that the use of this product while still harmful to health is probably less harmful than continued smoking 

in june 2018 the korean food and drug administration “kfda” issued a statement on products that heat rather than burn tobacco the kfda tested three heatnotburn products one of which was our platform 1 product the kfda confirmed that the levels of the nine hphcs tested in the aerosol of these products were on average approximately 90 lower compared to those measured in the cigarette smoke of the top five cigarette brands in south korea however the kfda stated that it could not establish that the tested heatnotburn products are less harmful than cigarettes in october 2018 our korean subsidiary filed a request with a local court seeking information underlying kfda’s analysis conclusions and public statements in may 2020 the court ordered kfda to produce certain records 

in august 2018 the science  technology committee of the uk house of commons published a report of its inquiry into ecigarettes and heatnotburn products the report concluded that ecigarettes are significantly less harmful to health than smoking tobacco the report also observed that for those smokers who do not accept ecigarettes heatnotburn products may offer a public health benefit despite their relative risk the report called for a riskproportionate regulatory environment for both ecigarettes and heatnotburn products and noted that ecigarettes should remain the least taxed cigarettes the most taxed with heatnotburn products falling between the two the uk committee on advertising practice announced the removal of a prohibition of health claims in the advertising of ecigarettes in the uk effective november 2018 

in november 2018 the eurasian economic commission regulatory body of the eurasian union consisting of armenia belarus kazakhstan kyrgyzstan and russia published the results of its commissioned study on novel nicotinecontaining products including our platform 1 product the study confirms significantly lower levels of hphcs in the aerosol generated by this product compared to cigarette smoke 

in january 2019 scientific media published the results of the study of the china national tobacco quality supervision and test centre “cntqst” comparing the aerosol generated by our platform 1 product with cigarette smoke the cntqst found that the former contained fewer and lower levels of harmful constituents than the latter and concluded that the lower temperature of heating tobacco in our platform 1 product contributed to the difference the cntqst stated that the reduction in emissions of harmful constituents cannot be interpreted as a harmrisk reduction for smokers in the same proportion 

in 2020 the superior health council of belgium “shc” published results of its inquiry into heatnotburn products the shc concluded that heatnotburn products while not safe have a more favorable toxicity profile than cigarettes however in light of the uncertainty of such products’ short and longterm impacts the toxic effects of the dual use with cigarettes and the existence of approved smoking cessation tools the shc recommended that current regulations for cigarettes should apply to heatnotburn products 

the foregoing scientific findings of government agencies may not be indicative of the measures that the relevant government authorities could take in regulating our products 

we make our scientific findings publicly available for scrutiny and peer review through several channels including our websites from time to time adult consumers competitors members of the scientific community and others inquire into our scientific methodologies challenge our scientific conclusions or request further study of certain aspects of our rrps and their health effects we are committed to a robust and open scientific debate and believe that such debate should be based on accurate and reliable scientific information we seek to provide accurate and reliable scientific information about our rrps nonetheless we may not be able to prevent thirdparty dissemination of false misleading or unsubstantiated information about these products the dissemination of scientifically unsubstantiated information or studies with a strong confirmation bias by third parties may cause confusion among adult smokers and affect their decision to switch to better alternatives to continued smoking such as our rrps 

to date we have been largely successful in demonstrating to regulators that our heated tobacco units are not cigarettes due to the absence of combustion and as such they are generally taxed either as a separate category or as other tobacco products which typically yields more favorable tax rates than cigarettes although we believe that this is sensible from the public health perspective we cannot guarantee that regulators will continue this approach 

there can be no assurance that we will succeed in our efforts to replace cigarettes with rrps or that regulation will allow us to commercialize rrps in all markets to communicate about our rrps including making scientifically substantiated riskreduction claims or to treat rrps differently from cigarettes 

legal challenges to rrps we face various administrative and legal challenges related to certain rrp activities including allegations concerning product classification advertising restrictions corporate communications product coach activities scientific substantiation product liability and unfair competition while we design our programs to comply with relevant regulations we expect these or similar challenges to continue as we expand our efforts to commercialize rrps and to communicate publicly the 

outcomes of these matters may affect our rrp commercialization and public communication activities and performance in one or more markets 

our rrp business development initiatives in december 2013 we established a strategic framework with altria group inc “altria” setting out terms on how the parties would collaborate to develop and commercialize evapor products and commercialize two of our rrps in the us in late 2018 altria announced that it will participate in the evapor category only through another evapor company in which altria acquired a minority interest in september 2019 altrias subsidiary philip morris usa inc “pm usa” began commercialization of a version of our platform 1 product in the us under the agreement pm usa must achieve certain milestones to maintain its exclusive distribution right and additional milestones to extend the agreement after the initial 5year term pmi and altria are currently discussing these milestones the contractual obligations and the impact of the united states international trade commission “itc” orders for more details please refer to item 8 note 17  contingencies  

in january 2020 we announced an agreement with ktg a leading tobacco and nicotine company in south korea for the commercialization of ktg’s smokefree products outside of south korea on an exclusive basis for more information see acquisitions and other business arrangements below 

other developments in september 2017 we announced our support of the foundation for a smokefree world in september 2020 our pledge agreement with the foundation was amended we contributed 45 million in 2020 40 million in 2021 and expect to contribute 35 million annually from 2022 through 2029 as specified in the amended pledge agreement to date we contributed a total of 2495 million the foundation is an independent body and is governed by its independent board of directors the foundation’s role as set out in its corporate charter includes funding research in the field of tobacco harm reduction encouraging measures that reduce the harm caused by smoking and assessing the effect of reduced cigarette consumption on the industry value chain 

governmental investigations

trade policy 

we are subject to various trade restrictions imposed by the us and countries in which we do business “trade sanctions” including the trade and economic sanctions administered by the us department of the treasurys office of foreign assets control and the us department of state it is our policy to comply fully with these trade sanctions 

tobacco products are agricultural products under us law and are not technological or strategic in nature from time to time we make sales in countries subject to trade sanctions either where such sanctions do not apply to our business or pursuant to exemptions or licenses 

from time to time a subsidiary sells products to distributors that in turn sell those products to duty free customers that supply un peacekeeping forces around the world including those in the un peacekeeping mission located in abyei a special administrative territory in sudan we do not believe that these sales which are not subject to trade sanctions and are de minimis in volume and value present a material risk to our shareholders our reputation or the value of our shares we have no employees operations or assets in sudan 

we do not sell products in iran north korea and syria from time to time we explore opportunities to sell our products in one or more of these countries as permitted by law 

we sell cigarettes in cuba under a distribution agreement these sales are permitted by us law under a license exception for agricultural commodities issued by the united states department of commerce bureau of industry and security granted to our 

distributor 

certain states within the us have enacted legislation permitting or requiring state pension funds to divest or abstain from future investment in stocks of companies that do business with certain countries that are sanctioned by the us because we do business in certain of these countries these state pension funds may have divested of our stock or may not invest in our stock we do not believe such legislation has had a material effect on the price of our shares 

pmi is also subject to various trade sanctions imposed by the eu and other jurisdictions trade sanctions we comply fully with these trade sanctions

further on august 9 2021 the uk introduced sectoral economic sanctions similar in scope to the eu sectoral sanctions of june 24 2021 also on august 9 2021 the us imposed blocking sanctions on certain individuals and entities pursuant to an executive order adding them to the list of specially designated nationals and blocked persons the sdn list issued by the us department of treasurys office of foreign asset control ofac the executive order expanded the bases for the imposition of sanctions including among others by authorizing the imposition by ofac of blocking sanctions on persons operating in the tobacco sector of the belarus economy as well as for providing material support or assistance to any sdn in december 2021 the us the eu the uk and canada amended their respective sanctions lists by including additional belarusian individuals entities and aircraft

financial review 



2021 compared with 2020 

• net cash provided by operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2021 increased by 22 billion compared with 2020 excluding favorable currency movements of 08 billion net cash provided by operating activities increased by 14 billion due primarily to higher net earnings and lower working capital requirements of 05 billion partially offset by higher pension plan contributions 

the lower working capital requirements in 2021 as compared with 2020 were primarily due to more cash provided by the net impact of both inventories and accrued liabilities and other current assets mainly reflecting covid19 pandemic related buildup of inventory levels in our supply chain in 2020 and the timing of excise taxpaid inventory movements and excise tax payments as well as higher cash provided by accounts payable primarily reflecting higher iqos device purchases in 2021 more cash used in accounts receivable was mainly due to the lower usage of our factoring arrangements to sell trade receivable partially offset by the brazil indirect tax credit recovered in 2021 for further details on our factoring arrangements to sell trade receivables and our brazil indirect tax credit recovered in 2021 see item 8 note 18 sale of accounts receivable and item 8 note 12 segment reporting respectively 

• net cash used in investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities of 24 billion for the year ended december 31 2021 increased by 12 billion from the comparable 2020 period this increase was primarily due to 21 billion of cash used in 2021 for our acquisitions net of acquired cash partially offset by favorable movements of 10 billion in cash collateral exchanged with financial institutions to secure derivatives designated as net investment hedges of euro assets principally related to changes in exchange rates between the euro and

• net cash used in financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities of 120 billion for the year ended december 31 2021 increased by 35 billion from the comparable 2020 period the change was primarily due to the proceeds we received in 2020 from longterm us dollar debt issuances 37 billion share purchases in 2021 under the new share repurchase program and higher dividend payments partially offset by lower repayments of longterm debt and lower payments to noncontrolling interests 

dividends paid in 2021 and 2020 were 76 billion and 74 billion respectively 

2020 compared with 2019

debt and liquidity 

we define cash and cash equivalents as shortterm highly liquid investments readily convertible to known amounts of cash that mature within a maximum of three months and have an insignificant risk of change in value due to interest rate or credit risk changes as a policy we do not hold any investments in structured or equitylinked products our cash and cash equivalents are predominantly held with institutions that have investmentgrade longterm credit rating as part of our cash management strategy and in order to manage counterparty exposure we also enter into reverse repurchase agreements such agreements are collateralized with government or corporate securities held by a custodial bank and at maturity cash is paid back to pmi and the collateral is returned to the bank for 2021 and 2020 the activities for such reverse repurchase agreements were not material 

in august 2021 we published a business transformationlinked financing framework “framework” which integrates the company’s smokefree transformation into its financing strategy the framework outlines the guidelines that we will follow in issuing business transformationlinked financing instruments in the debt capital and loan markets which may include public notes offerings private placements loans and other relevant financing instruments

we utilize longterm and shortterm debt financing including a commercial paper program that is regularly used to finance ongoing liquidity requirements as part of our overall cash management strategy our ability to access the capital and credit markets as well as overall dynamics of these markets may impact borrowing costs we expect that the combination of our longterm and shortterm debt financing the commercial paper program and the committed credit facilities coupled with our operating cash flows will enable us to meet our liquidity requirements 

• offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements including special purpose entities other than guarantees and cash requirements discussed above 

guarantees – at december 31 2021 we have guarantees of our own performance which are primarily related to excise taxes on the shipment of our products there is no liability in the consolidated financial statements associated with these guarantees these guarantees have not had and are not expected to have a significant impact on pmi’s liquidity in october 2020 we guaranteed an obligation for an equity method investee for further details see item 8 note 17 contingencies to our consolidated financial statements 

equity and dividends 

we discuss our stock awards as of december 31 2021 in item 8 note 9 stock plans to our consolidated financial statements 

during 2020 and the first six months of 2021 we did not repurchase any shares under a share repurchase program on june 11 2021 our board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program of up to 7 billion with target spending of 5 billion to 7 billion over a threeyear period on july 22 2021 we began repurchasing shares under this new share repurchase program from july 22 2021 through december 31 2021 we repurchased 85 million shares of our common stock at a cost of 785 million 

dividends paid in 2021 were 76 billion during the third quarter of 2021 our board of directors approved a 42 increase in the quarterly dividend to 125 per common share as a result the present annualized dividend rate is 500 per common share 

market risk 

counterparty risk  we predominantly work with financial institutions with strong short and longterm credit ratings as assigned by standard  poor’s and moody’s these banks are also part of a defined group of relationship banks noninvestment grade institutions are only used in certain emerging markets to the extent required by local business needs we have a conservative approach when it comes to choosing financial counterparties and financial instruments as such we do not invest or hold investments in any structured or equitylinked products the majority of our cash and cash equivalents is currently invested with maturities of less than 30 days 

we continuously monitor and assess the credit worthiness of all our counterparties 

derivative financial instruments  we operate in markets outside of the united states of america with manufacturing and sales facilities in various locations throughout the world consequently we use certain financial instruments to manage our foreign currency and interest rate exposure we use derivative financial instruments principally to reduce our exposure to market risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates by creating offsetting exposures we are not a party to leveraged derivatives and by policy do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 

see item 8 note 15 financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements for further details on our derivative financial instruments and the related collateral arrangements 

value at risk  we use a value at risk computation to estimate the potential oneday loss in the fair value of our interestratesensitive and foreign currency pricesensitive derivative financial instruments this computation includes our debt and foreign currency forwards swaps and options anticipated transactions foreign currency trade payables and receivables and net investments in foreign subsidiaries which the foregoing instruments are intended to hedge were excluded from the computation 

the computation estimates were made assuming normal market conditions using a 95 confidence interval and a oneday holding period using a parametric deltagamma approximation technique to determine the observed interrelationships between movements in interest rates and various currencies and in calculating the risk of the underlying positions in the portfolio these interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate and forward currency rate movements primarily over the preceding quarter for determining value at risk at december 31 2021 and 2020 and primarily over each of the four preceding quarters for the calculation of average high and low value at risk amounts during each year 



the significant yearoveryear decrease in average and high impact on the value at risk computation above was primarily due to an increase in interest rate and foreign currency volatility during the first quarter of 2020 resulting from the impact of the covid19 pandemic 

the value at risk computation is a risk analysis tool designed to statistically estimate the maximum probable daily loss from adverse movements in interest and foreign currency rates under normal market conditions the computation does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value or earnings to be incurred by us nor does it consider the effect of favorable changes in market rates we 

cannot predict actual future movements in such market rates and do not present these results to be indicative of future movements in market rates or to be representative of any actual impact that future changes in market rates may have on our future results of operations or financial position 

contingencies 

see item 3 and item 8 note 17 contingencies to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of contingencies 

cautionary factors that may affect future results

general development of business 

  

general 

  

philip morris international inc is a virginia holding company incorporated in 1987 we are a leading international tobacco company engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes as well as smokefree products associated electronic devices and accessories and other nicotinecontaining products in markets outside the united states of america in addition we ship versions of our platform 1 device and consumables to altria group inc for sale under license in the united states where these products have received marketing authorizations from the us food and drug administration fda under the premarket tobacco product application pmta pathway the fda has also authorized the marketing of a version of our platform 1 device and its consumables as a modified risk tobacco product mrtp finding that an exposure modification order for these products is appropriate to promote the public health 

we are leading a transformation in the tobacco industry to create a smokefree future based on a new category of reducedrisk products that while not risk free are a much better choice than continuing to smoke our goal is to ultimately replace cigarettes with smokefree products to the benefit of adults who would otherwise continue to smoke society the company and its shareholders 

reducedrisk products rrps is the term we use to refer to products that present are likely to present or have the potential to present less risk of harm to smokers who switch to these products versus continuing smoking we have a range of rrps in various stages of development scientific assessment and commercialization because our rrps do not burn tobacco they produce an aerosol that contains far lower quantities of harmful and potentially harmful constituents than found in cigarette smoke through multidisciplinary capabilities in product development stateoftheart facilities and scientific substantiation we aim to ensure that our rrps meet adult consumer preferences and rigorous regulatory requirements 

our iqos smokefree product brand portfolio includes heated tobacco and nicotinecontaining vapor products our leading smokefree platform platform 1 is a precisely controlled device into which a specially designed heated tobacco unit is inserted and heated to generate an aerosol heated tobacco units htu is the term we use to refer to heated tobacco consumables which for us include our heets  heets creations heets dimensions heets marlboro and heets from marlboro  defined collectively as heets  marlboro dimensions  marlboro heatsticks and parliament heatsticks as well as the ktglicensed brands fiit and miix outside of korea platform 1 was first introduced in nagoya japan in 2014 as of december 31 2020 platform 1 is available for sale in 64 markets in key cities or nationwide 

our cigarettes are sold in more than 175 markets and in many of these markets they hold the number one or number two market share position we have a wide range of premium midprice and lowprice brands our portfolio comprises both international and local brands and is led by marlboro  the world’s bestselling international cigarette which accounted for approximately 37 of our total 2020 cigarette shipment volume marlboro is complemented in the premiumprice category by parliament  our other leading international cigarette brands are bond street chesterfield lm  lark and philip morris these seven international cigarette brands contributed approximately 79 of our cigarette shipment volume in 2020 we also own a number of important local cigarette brands such as dji sam soe  sampoerna a and sampoerna u in indonesia and fortune and jackpot in the philippines

references to total international market defined as worldwide cigarette and heated tobacco unit volume excluding the united states total industry total market and market shares in this form 10k are our estimates for taxpaid products based on the latest available data from a number of internal and external sources and may in defined instances exclude the peoples republic of china andor our duty free business unless otherwise stated references to total industry total market our shipment volume and our market share performance reflect cigarettes and heated tobacco units in addition to reflect the deconsolidation of rbh effective march 22 2019 pmis total market share has been restated for previous periods 

2020 estimates for total industry volume and market share in certain geographies reflect limitations on the availability and accuracy of industry data during pandemicrelated restrictions 

our total shipments including cigarettes and heated tobacco units decreased by 81 in 2020 to 7046 billion units we estimate that international industry volumes including cigarettes and heated tobacco units were approximately 49 trillion units in 2020 a 30 decrease from 2019 excluding the people’s republic of china “prc” we estimate that international cigarette and heated tobacco unit volume was 25 trillion units in 2020 a 58 decrease from 2019 we estimate that our reported share of the international market which is defined as worldwide cigarette and heated tobacco unit volume excluding the united states of america was approximately 144 in 2020 151 in 2019 and 152 in 2018 excluding the prc we estimate that our reported share of the international market was approximately 277 284 and 283 in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively

distribution  sales 

our main types of distribution are tailored to the characteristics of each market and are often used simultaneously 

  

• direct sales and distribution where we have set up our own distribution selling directly to the retailers 

• distribution through independent distributors that often distribute other fastmoving consumer goods and are responsible for distribution in a particular market 

• exclusive zonified distribution where the distributors are dedicated to us in tobacco products distribution and assigned to exclusive territories within a market 

• distribution through national or regional wholesalers that then supply the retail trade and 

• our own brand retail and ecommerce infrastructures for our rrp products and accessories 

  

competition 

  

we are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business we compete primarily on the basis of product quality brand recognition brand loyalty taste rd innovation packaging customer service marketing advertising and retail price and increasingly adult smoker willingness to convert to our rrps in the combustible product category we predominantly sell american blend cigarette brands such as marlboro  lm  parliament philip morris and chesterfield  which are the most popular across many of our markets in the rrp product category we predominantly sell platform 1 devices and heated tobacco units under the iqos brand umbrella we seek to compete in all profitable retail price categories although our brand portfolio is weighted towards the premiumprice category 

the competitive environment and our competitive position can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions erosion of consumer confidence competitors introduction of lowerprice products or innovative products higher tobacco product taxes higher absolute prices and larger gaps between retail price categories and product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate tobacco products and restricts adult consumer access to truthful and nonmisleading information about our rrps competitors include three large international tobacco companies new market entrants particularly with respect to innovative products several regional and local tobacco companies and in some instances stateowned tobacco enterprises principally in algeria egypt the prc taiwan thailand and vietnam industry consolidation and privatizations of stateowned enterprises have led to an overall increase in competitive pressures some competitors have different profit and volume objectives and some international competitors are susceptible to changes in different currency exchange rates certain new market entrants may alienate consumers from innovative products through inappropriate marketing campaigns messaging and inferior product satisfaction while not relying on scientific substantiation based on appropriate rd protocols and standards the growing use of digital media could increase the speed and extent of the dissemination of inaccurate and misleading information about our rrps 

procurement and raw materials 

  

we purchase tobacco leaf of various types grades and styles throughout the world mostly through independent tobacco suppliers in 2020 we also contracted directly with farmers in several countries including argentina brazil colombia italy pakistan and poland in 2020 direct sourcing from farmers represented approximately 25 of pmi’s global leaf requirements the largest supplies of tobacco leaf are sourced from argentina brazil china italy indonesia mostly for domestic use in kretek products malawi mozambique the philippines turkey and the united states 

we believe that there is an adequate supply of tobacco leaf in the world markets to satisfy our current and anticipated production requirements 

in addition to tobacco leaf we purchase a wide variety of direct materials from a total of approximately 400 suppliers in 2020 our top ten suppliers of direct materials combined represented approximately 55 of our total direct materials purchases the three most significant direct materials that we purchase are printed paper board used in packaging acetate tow used in filter making and fine paper used in the manufacturing of cigarettes and heated tobacco units in addition the adequate supply and procurement of cloves are of particular importance to our indonesian business

other matters 

  

customers 

  

as described in more detail in “ distribution  sales ” above in many of our markets we sell our products to distributors in 2020 sales to a distributor in the european union region and a distributor in the east asia  australia region each amounted to 10 percent or more of our consolidated net revenues see item 8 note 12 segment reporting for more information we believe that none of our business segments is dependent upon a single customer or a few customers the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations in some of our markets particularly in the european union and in the east asia  australia regions a loss of a distributor may result in a temporary market disruption 

  

employees 

    

our workforce  at december 31 2020 we employed approximately 71000 people worldwide including fulltime temporary and parttime staff our businesses are subject to a number of laws and regulations relating to our relationship with our employees generally these laws and regulations are specific to the location of each business we engage with legally recognized employee representative bodies and we have collective bargaining agreements in many of the countries in which we operate in addition in accordance with european union requirements we have established a european works council composed of management and elected members of our workforce we believe we maintain good relations with our employees and their representative organizations

as discussed in more detail in item 1a risk factors  our financial results could be significantly affected by regulatory initiatives that could result in a significant decrease in demand for our brands more specifically any regulatory requirements that lead to a commoditization of tobacco products or impede adult consumers ability to convert to our rrps as well as any significant increase in the cost of complying with new regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial results

overall business risks 

consumption of taxpaid cigarettes continues to decline in many of our markets 

this decline is due to multiple factors including increased taxes and pricing governmental actions the diminishing social acceptance of smoking and health concerns continuing economic and geopolitical uncertainty and the continuing prevalence of illicit products these factors and their potential consequences are discussed more fully below and in item 7 business environment  

cigarettes are subject to substantial taxes significant increases in cigaretterelated taxes have been proposed or enacted and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted in numerous jurisdictions these tax increases may disproportionately affect our profitability and make us less competitive versus certain of our competitors 

tax regimes including excise taxes sales taxes and import duties can disproportionately affect the retail price of cigarettes versus other combustible tobacco products or disproportionately affect the relative retail price of our cigarette brands versus cigarette brands manufactured by certain of our competitors because our portfolio is weighted toward the premiumprice cigarette category tax regimes based on sales price can place us at a competitive disadvantage in certain markets as a result our volume and profitability may be adversely affected in these markets 

increases in cigarette taxes are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on our sales of cigarettes due to resulting lower consumption levels a shift in sales from manufactured cigarettes to other combustible tobacco products and from the premiumprice to the midprice or lowprice cigarette categories where we may be underrepresented from local sales to legal crossborder purchases of lower price products or to illicit products such as contraband counterfeit and illicit whites 

our business faces significant governmental action aimed at increasing regulatory requirements with the goal of reducing or preventing the use of tobacco products 

governmental actions combined with the diminishing social acceptance of smoking and private actions to restrict smoking have resulted in reduced industry volume in many of our markets and we expect that such factors will continue to reduce consumption levels and will increase downtrading and the risk of counterfeiting contraband illicit whites and legal crossborder purchases significant regulatory developments will continue to take place over the next few years in most of our markets driven principally by the world health organizations framework convention on tobacco control fctc since it came into force in 2005 the fctc has led to increased efforts by tobacco control advocates and public health organizations to promote increasingly restrictive regulatory measures on the marketing and sale of tobacco products to adult smokers regulatory initiatives that have been proposed introduced or enacted include 















our financial results could be significantly affected by regulatory initiatives resulting in a significant decrease in demand for our brands more specifically requirements that lead to a commoditization of tobacco products or impede adult consumers ability to convert to our rrps as well as any significant increase in the cost of complying with new regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

changes in the earnings mix and changes in tax laws may result in significant variability in our effective tax rates our ability to receive payments from foreign subsidiaries or to repatriate royalties and dividends could be restricted by local country currency exchange controls and other regulations 

we are subject to income tax laws in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions the results of the 2020 us presidential and congressional elections could lead to changes in the us tax system including significant increases in the us corporate income tax rate and the minimum tax rate on certain earnings of foreign subsidiaries if ultimately enacted into law such changes could have a material adverse impact on our effective tax rate thereby reducing our net earnings further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting project undertaken by the organisation for economic cooperation and development which recommended changes to numerous longstanding tax principles if implemented such changes as well as changes in taxing jurisdictions’ administrative interpretations decisions policies or positions could also have a material adverse impact on our effective tax rate thereby reducing our net earnings in future periods our ability to recover deferred tax assets could be subject to additional uncertainty as a result of such developments furthermore changes in the earnings mix or applicable foreign tax laws may result in significant variability in our effective tax rates 

because we are a us holding company our most significant source of funds is distributions from our nonus subsidiaries certain countries in which we operate have adopted or could institute currency exchange controls and other regulations that limit or prohibit our local subsidiaries ability to convert local currency into us dollars or to make payments outside the country this could subject us to the risks of local currency devaluation and business disruption 

risks related to our international operations 

because we have operations in numerous countries our results may be adversely impacted by economic regulatory and political developments natural disasters pandemics or conflicts 

some of the countries in which we operate face the threat of civil unrest and can be subject to regime changes in others nationalization terrorism conflict and the threat of war may have a significant impact on the business environment natural disasters pandemics economic political regulatory or other developments could disrupt our supply chain manufacturing capabilities or distribution capabilities in addition such developments could increase costs of our materials and operations and lead to loss of property or equipment that are critical to our business in certain markets and difficulty in staffing and managing our operations all of which could reduce our volumes revenues and net earnings we discuss risks associated with the covid19 pandemic below 

in certain markets we are dependent on governmental approvals of various actions such as price changes and failure to obtain such approvals could impair growth of our profitability 

in addition despite our high ethical standards and rigorous control and compliance procedures aimed at preventing and detecting unlawful conduct given the breadth and scope of our international operations we may not be able to detect all potential improper or unlawful conduct by our employees and partners 

our reported results could be adversely affected by unfavorable currency exchange rates and currency devaluations could impair our competitiveness 

we conduct our business primarily in local currency and for purposes of financial reporting the local currency results are translated into us dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period during times of a strengthening us dollar our reported net revenues operating income and eps will be reduced because the local currency translates into fewer us dollars during periods of economic crises such as during the ongoing covid19 pandemic foreign currencies may be devalued significantly against the us dollar reducing our margins actions to recover margins may result in lower volume and a weaker competitive position 

risks related to legal challenges and investigations 

litigation related to tobacco use and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke could substantially reduce our profitability and could severely impair our liquidity 

there is litigation related to tobacco products pending in certain jurisdictions in which we operate damages claimed in some tobaccorelated litigation are significant and in certain cases in brazil canada and nigeria range into the billions of us dollars we anticipate that new cases will continue to be filed the fctc encourages litigation against tobacco product manufacturers it is possible that our consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation see item 8 note 17 contingencies to our condensed consolidated financial statements for a discussion of pending litigation and business environment—reducedrisk products rrps—legal challenges to rrps 

from time to time we are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters 

investigations include allegations of contraband shipments of cigarettes allegations of unlawful pricing activities within certain markets allegations of underpayment of income taxes customs duties andor excise taxes allegations of false and misleading usage of descriptors allegations of unlawful advertising and allegations of unlawful labor practices we cannot predict the outcome of those investigations or whether additional investigations may be commenced and it is possible that our business could be materially affected by an unfavorable outcome of pending or future investigations see item 8 note 17 contingencies—other litigation and “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—operating results by business segment—business environment—governmental investigations” for a description of certain governmental investigations to which we are subject 

we may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights and disputes relating to intellectual property rights could harm our business 

our intellectual property rights are valuable assets and their protection is important to our business if the steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights globally including through a combination of trademark design patent and other intellectual property rights are inadequate or if others infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property rights notwithstanding legal protection our business could be adversely impacted intellectual property rights of third parties may limit our ability to commercialize our products or improve product quality in one or more markets competitors or other third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property rights any such claims regardless of merit could divert management’s attention be costly disruptive timeconsuming and unpredictable and expose us to litigation costs and damages and impede our ability to manufacture commercialize and improve our products if as a result we are unable to manufacture or sell our rrps or improve their quality in one or more markets our ability to 

convert adult smokers to our rrps in such markets would be adversely affected see item 8 note 17 contingencies—other litigation to our condensed consolidated financial statements for a description of certain intellectual property proceedings 

risks related to our competitive environment 

we face intense competition and our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations 

we are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business we compete primarily on the basis of product quality brand recognition brand loyalty taste rd innovation packaging customer service marketing advertising and retail price and increasingly adult smoker willingness to convert to our rrps the competitive environment and our competitive position can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions erosion of consumer confidence competitors introduction of lowerprice products or innovative products higher tobacco product taxes higher absolute prices and larger gaps between retail price categories and product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate tobacco products and restricts adult consumer access to truthful and nonmisleading information about our rrps competitors include three large international tobacco companies new market entrants particularly with respect to innovative products several regional and local tobacco companies and in some instances stateowned tobacco enterprises principally in algeria egypt the prc taiwan thailand and vietnam industry consolidation and privatizations of stateowned enterprises have led to an overall increase in competitive pressures some competitors have different profit and volume objectives and some international competitors are susceptible to changes in different currency exchange rates certain new market entrants may alienate consumers from innovative products through inappropriate marketing campaigns messaging and inferior product satisfaction while not relying on scientific substantiation based on appropriate rd protocols and standards the growing use of digital media could increase the speed and extent of the dissemination of inaccurate and misleading information about our rrps 

we may be unable to anticipate changes in adult consumer preferences 

our business is subject to changes in adult consumer preferences which may be influenced by local economic conditions 

to be successful we must 



in periods of economic uncertainty adult consumers may tend to purchase lowerprice brands and the volume of our premiumprice and midprice brands and our profitability could be materially adversely impacted as a result such downtrading trends may be reinforced by regulation that limits branding communication and product differentiation 

our ability to grow profitability may be limited by our inability to introduce new products enter new markets or improve our margins through higher pricing and improvements in our brand and geographic mix 

our profit growth may be adversely impacted if we are unable to introduce new products or enter new markets successfully to raise prices or to improve the proportion of our sales of higher margin products and in higher margin geographies 

we may be unable to expand our brand portfolio through successful acquisitions or the development of strategic business relationships 

one element of our growth strategy is to strengthen our brand portfolio and market positions through selective acquisitions and the development of strategic business relationships acquisition and strategic business development opportunities are limited and present risks of failing to achieve efficient and effective integration strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings there is no assurance that we will be able to acquire attractive businesses on favorable terms or that future acquisitions or strategic business developments will be accretive to earnings 

our ability to achieve our strategic goals may be impaired if we fail to attract motivate and retain the best global talent and effectively align our organizational design with the goals of our transformation 

to be successful we must continue transforming our culture and ways of working align our talent and organizational design with our increasingly complex business needs and innovate and transform to a consumercentric business we compete for talent including in areas that are new to us such as digital and technical solutions with companies in the consumer products technology and other sectors that enjoy greater societal acceptance as a result we may be unable to attract motivate and retain the best global talent with the right degree of diversity experience and skills to achieve our strategic goals 

risks related to the impact of covid19 on our business 

our business results of operations cash flows and financial position will be adversely impacted during the continuation of the covid19 pandemic 

the covid19 pandemic has created significant societal and economic disruption and resulted in closures of stores factories and offices and restrictions on manufacturing distribution and travel all of which have and will continue to adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial position while the pandemic continues our business continuity plans and other safeguards may not be effective to mitigate the impact of the pandemic 

currently significant risks include our diminished ability to convert adult smokers to our rrps significant volume declines in our dutyfree business and certain other key markets disruptions or delays in our manufacturing and supply chain increased currency volatility and delays in certain cost saving transformation and restructuring initiatives our business could also be adversely impacted if key personnel or a significant number of employees or business partners become unavailable due to the covid19 outbreak the significant adverse impact of covid19 on the economic or political conditions in markets in which we operate could result in changes to the preferences of our adult consumers and lower demand for our products particularly for our midprice or premiumprice brands continuation of the pandemic could disrupt our access to the credit markets or increase our borrowing costs governments may temporarily be unable to focus on the development of sciencebased regulatory frameworks for the development and commercialization of rrps or on the enforcement or implementation of regulations that are significant to our business in addition messaging about the potential negative impacts of the use of our products on covid19 risks may lead to increasingly restrictive regulatory measures on the sale and use of our products negatively impact demand for our products and the willingness of adult consumers to switch to our rrps and adversely impact our efforts to advocate for the development of sciencebased regulatory frameworks for the development and commercialization of rrps 

the impact of these risks also depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control including the duration and severity of the covid19 pandemic in general and specifically in the jurisdictions in which we operate its recurrence in our key markets actions taken to contain its spread and to mitigate its public health effects and the ultimate economic consequences thereof 

risks related to sourcing of materials products and services 

use of thirdparty resources may negatively impact quality of our products and services and we may be required to replace thirdparty contract manufacturers or service providers with our own resources 

we increasingly rely on thirdparty resources to manufacture some of our products and product parts particularly the electronic devices and accessories and to provide services including to support our finance and information technology processes while many of these arrangements improve efficiencies and decrease our operating costs they also diminish our direct control such diminished control may have an adverse effect on the quality of products or services our supply chain and the speed and flexibility in our response to changing market conditions and adult consumer preferences all of which may place us at a competitive disadvantage in addition we may be unable to renew these agreements on satisfactory terms for numerous reasons including government regulations and our costs may increase significantly if we must replace such third parties with our own resources 

government mandated prices production control programs shifts in crops driven by economic conditions and the impact of climate change may increase the cost or reduce the quality of the tobacco and other agricultural products used to manufacture our products 

as with other agricultural commodities the price of tobacco leaf and cloves can be influenced by imbalances in supply and demand and the impacts of natural disasters and pandemics such as covid19 furthermore crop quality may be influenced by variations in weather patterns including those caused by climate change tobacco production in certain countries is subject to a variety of controls including government mandated prices and production control programs changes in the patterns of demand for agricultural products could cause farmers to produce less tobacco or cloves any significant change in tobacco leaf and clove prices quality and quantity could affect our profitability and our business 

risks related to the success of our reducedrisk products 

the financial and business performance of our reducedrisk products is less predictable than our cigarette business 

our rrps are novel products in a new category and the pace at which adult smokers adopt them may vary depending on the competitive regulatory fiscal and cultural environment and other factors in a specific market there may be periods of accelerated growth and periods of slower growth for these products the timing and drivers of which may be more difficult for us to predict versus our mature cigarette business the impact of this lower predictability on our projected results for a specific period may be significant particularly during the early stages of this new product category and during the covid19 pandemic 

we may be unsuccessful in our attempts to introduce reducedrisk products and regulators may not permit the commercialization of these products or the communication of scientifically substantiated information and claims 

our key strategic priorities are to develop and commercialize products that present less risk of harm to adult smokers who switch to those products versus continued smoking and to convince current adult smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke to switch to those rrps for our efforts to be successful we must 



we might not succeed in our efforts if we do not succeed but others do or if heatnotburn products are inequitably regulated compared to other rrp categories without regard to the totality of the scientific evidence available for such products we may be at a competitive disadvantage in addition actions of some market entrants such as the inappropriate marketing of evapor products to youth as well as alleged health consequences associated with the use of certain evapor products may unfavorably impact public opinion andor mischaracterize all evapor products or other rrps to consumers regulators and policy makers without regard to the totality of scientific evidence for specific products this may impede our efforts to advocate for the development of sciencebased regulatory frameworks for the development and commercialization of rrps we cannot predict whether regulators will permit the sale andor marketing of rrps with scientifically substantiated information and claims such restrictions could limit the success of our rrps 

our rrps and commercial activities for these products are designed for and directed toward current adult smokers and users of nicotinecontaining products and not for nonsmokers or youth if nonetheless there is a significant usage of our products or competitive products among youth or nonsmokers even in situations over which we have no control our credibility may suffer and our efforts to advocate for the development of sciencebased regulatory frameworks for the commercialization of rrps may be significantly impacted 

moreover the fda’s premarket tobacco product and modified risk tobacco product authorizations of a version of our platform 1 product are subject to strict marketing reporting and other requirements although we have received these product authorizations from the fda there is no guarantee that the product will remain authorized particularly if there is a significant uptake in youth or nonsmoker initiation 

we may be unsuccessful in our efforts to differentiate reducedrisk products and cigarettes with respect to taxation 

to date we have been largely successful in demonstrating to regulators that our rrps are not cigarettes due to the absence of combustion and as such they are generally taxed either as a separate category or as other tobacco products which typically yields more favorable tax rates than cigarettes if we cease to be successful in these efforts rrp unit margins may be adversely affected 

risks related to illicit trade 

we lose revenues as a result of counterfeiting contraband crossborder purchases illicit whites nontaxpaid volume produced by local manufacturers and counterfeiting of our platform 1 device and heated tobacco units 

large quantities of counterfeit cigarettes are sold in the international market we believe that marlboro is the most heavily counterfeited international cigarette brand although we cannot quantify the revenues we lose as a result of this activity in addition our revenues are reduced by contraband legal crossborder purchases illicit whites and nontaxpaid volume produced by local 

manufacturers our revenues and consumer satisfaction with our platform 1 device and heated tobacco units may be adversely affected by counterfeit products that do not meet our product quality standards and scientific validation procedures 

risks related to cybersecurity and data governance 

the failure of our information systems to function as intended or their penetration with the intent to corrupt them or our failure to adhere to strict data governance and cybersecurity protocols and to comply with privacy laws and regulations could result in business disruption loss of reputation litigation and regulatory action and loss of revenue assets or personal or other confidential data 

we use information systems to help manage business processes collect and interpret data and communicate internally and externally with employees suppliers consumers customers and others some of these information systems are managed by thirdparty service providers we have backup systems and business continuity plans in place and we work with our internal specialists and these thirdparty service providers to protect these systems and data from unauthorized access nevertheless failure of these systems to function as intended or penetration of these systems by parties intent on extracting or corrupting information or otherwise disrupting business processes could place us at a competitive disadvantage result in a loss of revenue assets or personal or other sensitive data litigation and regulatory action cause damage to our reputation and that of our brands and result in significant remediation and other costs failure to protect personal data respect the rights of data subjects and adhere to strict data governance and cybersecurity protocols could subject us to substantial fines and other legal challenges under regulations such as the eu general data protection regulation as we are increasingly relying on digital platforms in our business and as privacy laws in the jurisdictions in which we do business become more stringent the magnitude of these risks is likely to increase

executive summary 

the following executive summary provides the business update and significant highlights from the discussion and analysis that follows 

consolidated operating results 

• net revenues – net revenues of 287 billion for the year ended december 31 2020 decreased by 11 billion or 37 from the comparable 2019 amount and were impacted by the effects of the covid19 pandemic particularly in the second quarter of 2020 and continuing throughout the second half of the year the change in our net revenues from the comparable 2019 amount was driven by the following variances not to scale 

net revenues excluding unfavorable currency decreased by 22 reflecting unfavorable volumemix primarily due to lower cigarette volume mainly in argentina indonesia italy japan mexico the philippines pmi duty free poland russia and ukraine partly offset by germany partially offset by higher heated tobacco unit volume notably in the eu japan russia and ukraine partly offset by pmi duty free and the unfavorable impact of 253 million shown in costother mainly resulting from the deconsolidation of our canadian subsidiary rothman benson  hedges inc rbh effective march 22 2019 and lower fees for certain distribution rights billed to customers in certain markets partly offset by a favorable pricing variance notably driven by the gulf cooperation council germany japan mexico north africa the philippines pmi duty free russia and ukraine partially offset by indonesia poland and turkey for further details on the deconsolidation of rbh see item 8 note 17 contingencies and note 20 deconsolidation of rbh the gulf cooperation council gcc is defined as bahrain kuwait oman qatar saudi arabia and the united arab emirates uae 

net revenues by product category for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 are shown below 

  

• diluted earnings per share – the changes in our reported diluted earnings per share “diluted eps” for the year ended december 31 2020 from the comparable 2019 amounts were as follows 



asset impairment and exit costs – during 2019 as part of the optimization of our global manufacturing infrastructure we recorded pretax asset impairment and exit costs of 422 million representing 362 million net of income tax and a diluted eps charge of 023 per share this 2019 charge primarily related to a cigarette plant closure in berlin germany approximately 019 per share as well as the closure of cigarette plants in argentina colombia and pakistan during 2020 we recorded pretax asset impairment and exit costs of 149 million representing 124 million net of income tax and a diluted eps charge of 

008 per share related to the organizational design optimization plan primarily in switzerland the total pretax charges in 2019 and 2020 were included in marketing administration and research costs on the consolidated statements of earnings for further details see item 8 note 19 asset impairment and exit costs  

canadian tobacco litigationrelated expense – in the first quarter of 2019 we recorded a pretax charge of 194 million representing 142 million net of tax relating to the judgment against rbh in two québec smoking and health class actions the charge of 009 per share reflects our assessment of the portion of the judgment that represents a probable and estimable loss prior to the deconsolidation of rbh and corresponds to the trust account deposit required by the judgment the total pretax charge was included in marketing administration and research costs on the consolidated statements of earnings and was included in the operating income of the latin america  canada segment for further details see item 8 note 17 contingencies and item 8 note 20 deconsolidation of rbh  

loss on deconsolidation of rbh – following the judgment in the two québec smoking and health class actions rbh obtained an initial order from the ontario superior court of justice granting it protection under the companies’ creditors arrangement act “ccaa” which is a canadian federal law that permits a canadian business to restructure its affairs while carrying on its business in the ordinary course with minimal disruption to its customers suppliers and employees the administration of the ccaa process principally relating to the powers provided to the court and the court appointed monitor removes certain elements of control of the business from both pmi and rbh as a result we have determined that we no longer have a controlling financial interest over rbh and that we do not exert significant influence over rbh under us gaap therefore we deconsolidated rbh as of the date of the ccaa filing on march 22 2019 and have accounted for our continuing investment in rbh as an equity security without readily determinable fair value 

a loss on the deconsolidation of rbh of 239 million was included in marketing administration and research costs on the consolidated statements of earnings for the year ended december 31 2019 and was included in the operating income of the latin america  canada segment the 012 per share impact also included a tax benefit of 49 million within the provision for income taxes as discussed below related to the reversal of a deferred tax liability on the unremitted earnings of rbh for further details see item 8 note 17 contingencies and item 8 note 20 deconsolidation of rbh

income taxes – the 2019 tax items that increased our 2019 diluted eps by 004 per share in the table above were primarily due to a reduction in estimated us federal income tax on dividend repatriation for the years 2015  2018 67 million the 2020 tax items that increased our 2020 diluted eps by 006 per share in the table above were due to final us tax regulations under the global intangible lowtaxed income gilti provisions of the internal revenue code for years 2018 and 2019 93 million for further details see item 8 note 11 income taxes  

the change in the tax rate that increased our diluted eps by 005 per share in the table above was primarily due to changes in earnings mix by taxing jurisdiction a reduction of us state tax expense and the corporate income tax rate reduction in indonesia 

partially offset by a decrease in deductions related to foreignderived intangible income for the years 2018 and 2019 and repatriation cost differences for further details see item 8 note 11 income taxes  

currency – the unfavorable currency impact during 2020 results from the fluctuations of the us dollar especially against the argentine peso brazilian real indonesian rupiah mexican peso russian ruble swiss franc and turkish lira partially offset by the egyptian pound japanese yen and philippine peso this unfavorable currency movement has impacted our profitability across our primary revenue markets and local currency cost bases 

interest – the unfavorable impact of interest was due primarily to lower interest earned on cash balances 

operations – the increase in diluted eps of 027 from our operations in the table above was due primarily to the following segments 

• european union favorable volumemix favorable pricing and lower manufacturing costs partially offset by higher marketing administration and research costs 

• east asia  australia lower marketing administration and research costs lower manufacturing costs and favorable pricing partially offset by unfavorable volumemix and 

• eastern europe favorable pricing favorable volumemix and lower manufacturing costs partially offset by higher marketing administration and research costs  

partially offset by

covid19 impact on our business 

covid19 business continuity update 

since the onset of the covid19 pandemic pmi has undertaken a number of business continuity measures to mitigate potential disruption to its operations and routetomarket in order to preserve the availability of products to its customers and adult consumers 

currently 

• pmi has sufficient access to the inputs for its products and is not facing any significant business continuity issues with respect to key suppliers 

• all of of pmis cigarette and heated tobacco unit manufacturing facilities globally are operational 

• covidrelated restrictions do not have a significant impact on the availability of pmis products to its customers and adult consumers and 

• pmi has sufficient liquidity resources through cash on hand the ongoing cash generation of its business and its access to the commercial paper and debt markets 

nonetheless significant uncertainty remains as the spread of the disease is increasing in a number of markets resulting in additional restrictions and increasing risk of disruptions 

discussion and analysis 

critical accounting estimates 

item 8 note 2 summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in most instances we must use a particular accounting policy or method because it is the only one that is permitted under us gaap 

the preparation of financial statements requires that we use estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets liabilities net revenues and expenses as well as our disclosure of contingencies if actual amounts differ from previous estimates we include the revisions in our consolidated results of operations in the period during which we know the actual amounts historically aggregate differences if any between our estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 

the selection and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates have been discussed with our audit committee the following is a discussion of the more significant assumptions estimates accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition  we recognize revenue as performance obligations are satisfied our primary performance obligation is the distribution and sales of cigarettes and other nicotinecontaining products including reducedrisk products our performance obligations are typically satisfied upon shipment or delivery to our customers the company estimates the cost of sales returns based on historical experience and these estimates are immaterial estimated costs associated with warranty programs for iqos devices are generally provided for in cost of sales in the period the related revenues are recognized based on a number of factors including historical experience product failure rates and warranty policies the transaction price is typically based on the amount billed to the customer and includes estimated variable consideration where applicable such variable consideration is typically not constrained and is estimated based on the most likely amount that pmi expects to be entitled to under the terms of the contracts with customers historical experience of discount or rebate redemption where relevant and the terms of any underlying discount or rebate programs which may change from time to time as the business and product categories evolve 

inventories  our inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions the valuation of inventory also requires us to estimate obsolete and excess inventory we perform regular reviews of our inventory on hand as well as our future purchase commitments with our suppliers considering multiple factors including demand forecasts product life cycle current sales levels pricing strategy and cost trends if our review indicates that inventories of raw materials components or finished products have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or that inventory cost exceeds net realizable value we may be required to make adjustments that will impact the results of operations 

goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets valuation  we test goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events occur that would warrant such review while the company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment for both goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets to determine if it is more likely than not that an impairment exists the company elects to perform the quantitative assessment for our annual impairment analysis the impairment analysis involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit or nonamortizable intangible asset to the carrying value if the carrying value exceeds the fair value goodwill or a nonamortizable intangible asset is considered impaired to determine the fair value of goodwill we primarily use the market approach using earnings multiples of comparable global companies within the tobacco industry supported by a discounted cash flow model at december 31 2020 the carrying value of our goodwill was 60 billion which is related to ten reporting units each of which consists of a group of markets with similar operating and economic characteristics the estimated fair value of each of our ten reporting units exceeded the carrying value as of december 31 2020 to determine the fair value of nonamortizable intangible assets we primarily use a discounted cash flow model applying the relieffromroyalty method we concluded that the fair value of our nonamortizable intangible assets exceeded the carrying value these discounted cash flow models include management assumptions relevant for forecasting operating cash flows which are subject to changes in business conditions such as volumes and prices costs to produce discount rates and estimated capital needs management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the fair values are estimated and we believe these assumptions are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use since the march 28 2008 spinoff from altria group inc we have not recorded a charge to earnings for an impairment of goodwill or nonamortizable intangible assets 

marketing costs  we incur certain costs to support our products through programs that include advertising marketing consumer engagement and trade promotions the costs of our advertising and marketing programs are expensed in accordance with us gaap recognition of the cost related to our consumer engagement and trade promotion programs contain uncertainties due to the 

judgment required in estimating the potential performance and compliance for each program for volumebased incentives provided to customers management continually assesses and estimates by customer the likelihood of the customers achieving the specified targets and records the reduction of revenue as the sales are made for other trade promotions management relies on estimated utilization rates that have been developed from historical experience changes in the assumptions used in estimating the cost of any individual marketing program would not result in a material change in our financial position results of operations or operating cash flows 

employee benefit plans  as discussed in item 8 note 13 benefit plans to our consolidated financial statements we provide a range of benefits to our employees and retired employees including pensions postretirement health care and postemployment benefits primarily severance we record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by us gaap these calculations include various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates assumed rates of return on plan assets compensation increases mortality turnover rates and health care cost trend rates we review actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so as permitted by us gaap any effect of the modifications is generally amortized over future periods we believe that the assumptions utilized in calculating our obligations under these plans are reasonable based upon our historical experience and advice from our actuaries 

weightedaverage discount rate assumptions for pension and postretirement plan obligations at december 31 2020 and 2019 are as follows 



we anticipate that assumption changes will increase 2021 pretax pension and postretirement expense to approximately 300 million as compared with approximately 264 million in 2020 excluding amounts related to employee severance and early retirement programs the anticipated increase is primarily due to higher amortization of unrecognized actuarial gainslosses of 50 million coupled with higher service cost of 24 million partially offset by lower interest cost of 18 million and higher expected return on plan assets of 17 million and other movements of 3 million 

weightedaverage expected rate of return and discount rate assumptions have a significant effect on the amount of expense reported for the employee benefit plans a fiftybasispoint decrease in our discount rate would increase our 2021 pension and postretirement expense by approximately 80 million and a fiftybasispoint increase in our discount rate would decrease our 2021 pension and postretirement expense by approximately 70 million similarly a fiftybasispoint decrease increase in the expected return on plan assets would increase decrease our 2021 pension expense by approximately 40 million 

income taxes  income tax provisions for jurisdictions outside the united states as well as state and local income tax provisions are determined on a separate company basis and the related assets and liabilities are recorded in our consolidated balance sheets 

the extent of our operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions the final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal state and international tax audits in accordance with the authoritative guidance for income taxes we evaluate potential tax exposures and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment an additional charge to expense would result if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 

we are required to assess the likelihood of recovering deferred tax assets against future sources of taxable income if we determine using all available evidence that we do not reach the more likely than not threshold for recovery a valuation allowance is recorded significant judgment is required in determining the need for and amount of valuation allowances for deferred tax assets including estimates of future taxable income in the applicable jurisdictions and the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies as applicable 

the effective tax rates used for interim reporting are based on our fullyear geographic earnings mix projections changes in currency exchange rates earnings mix by taxing jurisdiction or future regulatory developments may have an impact on the effective tax rates significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions 

for further details see item 8 note 11 income taxes to our consolidated financial statements 

hedging  as discussed below in “market risk” we use derivative financial instruments principally to reduce exposures to market risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates by creating offsetting exposures for derivatives to which we have elected to apply hedge accounting gains and losses on these derivatives are initially deferred in accumulated other comprehensive losses on the consolidated balance sheet and recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings into the same line item as the impact of the underlying transaction and in the periods when the related hedged transactions are also recognized in operating results if we had elected not to use the hedge accounting provisions gains losses deferred in stockholders’ deficit equity would have been recorded in our net earnings for these derivatives 

fair value of nonmarketable equity securities  for further details see item 8 note 20 deconsolidation of rbh 

contingencies  as discussed in item 8 note 17 contingencies to our consolidated financial statements legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened against us andor our subsidiaries andor our indemnitees in various jurisdictions we and our subsidiaries record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated the variability in pleadings in multiple jurisdictions together with the actual experience of management in litigating claims demonstrate that the monetary relief that may be specified in a lawsuit bears little relevance to the ultimate outcome much of the tobaccorelated litigation is in its early stages and litigation is subject to uncertainty at the present time except as stated otherwise in item 8 note 17 contingencies while it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur after assessing the information available to it i management has not concluded that it is probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending tobaccorelated cases ii management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss for any of the pending tobaccorelated cases and iii accordingly no estimated loss has been accrued in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes in these cases if any legal defense costs are expensed as incurred

operating results by business segment 

business environment 

taxes legislation regulation and other matters regarding the manufacture marketing sale and use of tobacco products 

the tobacco industry and our company face a number of challenges that may adversely affect our business volume results of operations cash flows and financial position these challenges which are discussed below and in “ cautionary factors that may affect future results ” include 

• regulatory restrictions on our products including restrictions on the packaging marketing and sale of tobacco or other nicotinecontaining products that could reduce our competitiveness eliminate our ability to communicate with adult consumers or even ban certain of our products 

• fiscal challenges such as excessive excise tax increases and discriminatory tax structures 

• illicit trade in cigarettes and other tobacco and nicotinecontaining products including counterfeit contraband and socalled “illicit whites” 

• intense competition including from nontax paid volume by certain local manufacturers 

• pending and threatened litigation as discussed in item 8 note 17 contingencies  and 

• governmental investigations 

regulatory restrictions the tobacco industry operates in a highly regulated environment the wellknown risks of smoking have led regulators to impose significant restrictions and high excise taxes on cigarettes 

much of the regulation that shapes the business environment in which we operate is driven by the world health organizations “who” framework convention on tobacco control “fctc” which entered into force in 2005 the fctc has as its main objective to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation with the purpose of reducing tobacco use to date 181 countries and the european union are parties to the fctc the treaty requires parties to have in place various tobacco control measures and recommends others the fctc governing body the conference of the parties “cop” has also adopted nonbinding guidelines and policy recommendations related to certain articles of the fctc that go beyond the text of the treaty in october 2018 the cop recognized the need for more scientific assessment and improved reporting to define policy on heated tobacco products similar to its previous policy recommendations on ecigarettes the cop invited countries to regulate restrict or prohibit heated tobacco products as appropriate under their national laws 

in july 2019 the who issued the report on the global tobacco epidemic 2019 while citing insufficient independent studies regarding the benefits and the unknown longterm health impacts of electronic nicotine delivery systems and heated tobacco products the who has taken the position that such products are not riskfree and should be regulated in the same manner as cigarettes and in line with the fctc provisions it is not possible to predict whether or to what extent measures recommended by the who including the fctc guidelines will be implemented 

we believe that when better alternatives to cigarettes exist the discussion should not be whether these alternatives should be made available to the more than one billion men and women who smoke today but how fast and within what regulatory framework to maximize their adoption while minimizing unintended use therefore we advocate for regulatory frameworks that recognize a significant difference on a risk continuum between combustible tobacco on the one hand and noncombustible tobacco and other nicotinecontaining products on the other regulation should include measures that will accelerate switching to noncombustible products for example by allowing adult consumers who would not otherwise quit to receive truthful and nonmisleading information about such products to enable them to make informed decisions and by applying uniform product standards to enable manufacturers to demonstrate the safety of these products as well as the absence of combustion regulation should also include specific rules for ingredients labeling and consumer communication and should ensure that the public is informed about the health risks of all combustible and noncombustible tobacco and nicotinecontaining products importantly regulation must include measures designed to prevent initiation by youth and nonsmokers we support mandated health warnings minimum age laws restrictions on advertising and public place smoking restrictions we also support regulatory measures that help reduce illicit trade 

certain measures are discussed in more detail below and in the reducedrisk products rrps section 

fiscal challenges excessive and disruptive excise sales and other tax increases and discriminatory tax structures are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on our profitability due to lower consumption and consumer downtrading to nonpremium discount other lowprice or lowtaxed combustible tobacco products such as fine cut tobacco and illicit cigarettes in addition in certain jurisdictions some of our combustible products are subject to tax structures that discriminate against premiumprice products and manufactured cigarettes we believe that such tax policies undermine public health by encouraging consumers to turn to illicit trade and ultimately undercut government revenue objectives disrupt the competitive environment and encourage criminal activity other jurisdictions have imposed or are seeking to impose levies or other taxes specifically on tobacco companies such as taxes on revenues andor profits 

world customs organization developments  in 2020 the world customs organization “wco” amended the harmonized system nomenclature to introduce dedicated custom codes for novel tobacco and nicotine products including heated tobacco products ecigarettes and other nicotinecontaining products the amendments will be effective as of january 1 2022 these amendments require wco member states to transfer products from customs codes in the current nomenclature to the new one these amendments are not expected to significantly impact current customs duty rates 

eu tobacco products directive in april 2014 the eu adopted a significantly revised eu tobacco products directive tpd which entered into force in may 2016 all member states have adopted laws transposing the tpd the tpd sets forth a comprehensive set of regulatory requirements for tobacco products including 

• health warnings covering 65 of the front and back panels of cigarette packs with an option for member states to further standardize tobacco packaging including the introduction of plain packaging 

• a ban on characterizing flavors in some tobacco products with a transition period for menthol that expired in may 2020 

• security features and tracking and tracing measures that became effective on may 20 2019 and 

• a framework for the regulation of novel tobacco products and ecigarettes including requirements for health warnings and information leaflets a prohibition on product packaging text related to reduced risk and the introduction of notification requirements or authorization procedures in advance of commercialization 

the eu commission’s directorate general for health and food safety is preparing a report on the implementation of the tpd including the evaluation of whether the tpd has achieved its objectives and is still relevant considering scientific international and technical developments including in novel tobacco products and ecigarettes the report is expected to include recommendations on potential revisions of the tpd to account for such developments the report is due by may 2021 

eu tobacco excise directive the eu commission is preparing a legislative proposal for the revision of the 2011 eu tobacco excise directive that may include definitions and tax treatment for novel tobacco and nicotinecontaining products including heated tobacco products and ecigarettes the proposal is expected to be finalized by the end of 2021 the adoption of the proposal will require unanimous agreement by all eu member states 

plain packaging and other packaging restrictions plain packaging legislation bans the use of branding logos and colors on packaging other than the brand name and variant that may be printed only in specified locations and in a uniform font to date plain packaging laws have been adopted in certain markets in all of our operating segments including the key markets of australia france saudi arabia and turkey some countries such as canada new zealand israel and denmark adopted plain packaging regulations that apply to all tobacco products including rrps other countries are also considering plain packaging legislation 

some countries have adopted or are considering adopting packaging restrictions that could have an impact similar to plain packaging examples of such restrictions include standardizing the shape and size of packages prohibiting certain colors or the use of certain descriptive phrases on packaging and requiring very large graphic health warnings that leave little space for branding 

restrictions and bans on the use of ingredients the who and others in the public health community have recommended restrictions or total bans on the use of some or all ingredients in tobacco products including menthol broad restrictions and ingredient bans would require us to reformulate our american blend tobacco products and could reduce our ability to differentiate these products in the market in the long term in many countries menthol bans would eliminate the entire category of mentholated tobacco products the european union banned cigarettes and rollyourown tobacco products with characterizing flavors other tobacco products including heated tobacco products are exempted from this flavor ban the eu commission is required to withdraw this exemption for a particular product category if it determines that there is a substantial change of circumstances such as a significant increase of euwide sales volumes in such product category other countries may follow the eu’s approach turkey banned menthol as of may 2020 broader ingredient bans have been adopted by canada and brazil 

bans on display of tobacco products at retail in a number of our markets including but not limited to australia and russia governments have banned the display of tobacco products at the point of sale other countries are considering similar bans 

bans and restrictions on advertising marketing promotions and sponsorships for many years the fctc has called for and countries have imposed partial or total bans on tobacco advertising marketing promotions and sponsorships including bans and restrictions on advertising on radio and television in print and on the internet the fctcs nonbinding guidelines recommend that governments prohibit all forms of communication with adult smokers 

restrictions on product design some members of the public health community are calling for the further standardization of tobacco products by requiring for example that cigarettes have a certain minimum diameter which would amount to a ban on slim cigarettes or requiring the use of standardized filter and cigarette paper designs in addition at its meeting in november 2016 the cop adopted nonbinding guidelines recommending that countries regulate product design features that increase the attractiveness of tobacco products such as the diameter of cigarettes and the use of flavor capsules 

restrictions on public smoking and use of nicotinecontaining products in public the pace and scope of restrictions on the use of our products have increased significantly in most of our markets many countries around the world have adopted or are likely to adopt regulations that restrict or ban smoking and use of nicotinecontaining products in public andor work places restaurants bars and nightclubs some public health groups have called for and some countries regional governments and municipalities have adopted or proposed bans on smoking in outdoor places as well as bans on smoking in cars typically when minors are present and private homes 

other regulatory issues some regulators are considering or in some cases have adopted regulatory measures designed to reduce the supply of tobacco products these include regulations intended to reduce the number of retailers selling tobacco products by for example reducing the overall number of tobacco retail licenses available or banning the sale of tobacco products within specified distances of certain public facilities in addition south africa banned the sale of tobacco products ecigarettes and electronic devices that heat tobacco for several months during the covid19 pandemic the ban which was lifted on august 17 2020 resulted in a significant increase of illicit trade of tobacco products 

in a limited number of markets most notably japan we are dependent on governmental approvals that may limit our pricing flexibility 

the eu singleuse plastics directive which will require tobacco manufacturers and importers to cover the costs of public collection systems for tobacco product filters entered into force on july 2 2019 after which member states will have two years to transpose it into national law while we cannot predict the impact of this initiative on our business at this time we are monitoring developments in this area 

illicit trade illicit tobacco trade creates a cheap and unregulated supply of tobacco products undermines efforts to reduce smoking prevalence especially among youth damages legitimate businesses and intellectual property rights stimulates organized crime 

increases corruption and reduces government tax revenue without accounting for any potential covid19related impact we generally estimate that excluding china and the us illicit trade may account for as much as 10 to 12 of global cigarette consumption this includes counterfeit contraband and the persistent problem of “illicit whites” which are cigarettes legally produced in one jurisdiction for the sole purpose of being exported and illegally sold in another jurisdiction where they have no legitimate market currently we estimate that illicit trade in the european union accounted for approximately 8 of total cigarette consumption in 2019 

a number of jurisdictions are considering actions to prevent illicit trade in november 2012 the fctc adopted the protocol to eliminate illicit trade in tobacco products the “protocol” which includes supply chain control measures such as licensing of manufacturers and distributors enforcement of these control measures in free trade zones controls on duty free and internet channels and the implementation of tracking and tracing technologies to date 62 parties including the european union have ratified it the protocol came into force in september 2018 parties must start implementing its provisions in their national legislation in october 2018 the first meeting of the parties to the protocol decided to produce a comprehensive report on good practices for the implementation of tracking and tracing systems and to prepare a conceptual framework for global information sharing to combat illicit tobacco trade we welcome this decision and expect that other parties will ratify the protocol 

we devote substantial resources to help prevent illicit trade in combustible tobacco products and rrps for example we engage with governments our business partners and other stakeholders to implement effective measures to combat illicit trade and in some instances pursue legal remedies to protect our intellectual property rights 

the tracking and tracing regulations for cigarettes and rollyourown products manufactured or destined for the eu became effective on may 20 2019 the effective date for other tobaccocontaining products including some of our rrps such as heated tobacco units is may 20 2024 while we expect that this regulation will increase our operating expenses we do not expect this increase to be significant 

in 2009 our colombian subsidiaries entered into an investment and cooperation agreement with the national and regional governments of colombia to promote investment in and cooperation on anticontraband and anticounterfeit efforts the agreement provides 200 million in funding over a 20year period to address issues such as combating illegal cigarette trade and increasing the quality and quantity of locallygrown tobacco 

in may 2016 pmi launched pmi impact a global initiative that supports thirdparty projects dedicated to fighting illegal trade and related crimes such as corruption organized criminal networks and money laundering the centerpiece of pmi impact is a council of external independent experts in the fields of law anticorruption and law enforcement the experts are responsible for evaluating and approving funding proposals for pmi impact grants pmi has pledged 100 million to fund projects within pmi impact over three funding rounds 

reducedrisk products rrps   

our approach to rrps we recognize that smoking cigarettes causes serious diseases and that the best way to avoid the harms of smoking is never to start or to quit nevertheless it is predicted that over the next decade the number of smokers will remain largely unchanged from the current estimate of 11 billion despite the considerable efforts to discourage smoking 

cigarettes burn tobacco which produces smoke as a result of the combustion process the smoker inhales various toxic substances in contrast rrps do not burn tobacco and produce an aerosol that contains significantly lower levels of harmful and potentially harmful constituents hphcs than found in cigarette smoke 

for adult smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke we believe that rrps while not riskfree offer a much better consumer choice accordingly our key strategic priorities are to develop and commercialize products that present less risk of harm to adult smokers who switch to those products versus continued smoking and to convince current adult smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke to switch to those products 

we recognize that this transformation from cigarettes to rrps will take time and that the speed of transformation will depend in part upon factors beyond our control such as the willingness of governments regulators and other policy groups to embrace rrps as a desired alternative to continued cigarette smoking we also recognize that our part in this transformation must be funded from our existing cigarette business for as long as a significant number of adult smokers continues to smoke it is critical that the industry be led by responsible and ethical manufacturers therefore during the transformation we intend to remain a leading international cigarette manufacturer 

we have a range of rrps in various stages of development scientific assessment and commercialization we conduct rigorous scientific assessments of our rrp platforms to substantiate that they reduce exposure to hphcs and ultimately that these products present are likely to present or have the potential to present less risk of harm to adult smokers who switch to them versus continued smoking we draw upon a team of expert scientists and engineers from a broad spectrum of scientific disciplines and our extensive learnings of adult consumer preferences to develop and assess our rrps our efforts are guided by the following key objectives 

• to develop rrps that adult smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke find to be satisfying alternatives to smoking 

• for those adult smokers our goal is to offer rrps with a scientifically substantiated riskreduction profile that approaches as closely as possible that associated with smoking cessation 

• to substantiate the reduction of risk for the individual adult smoker and the reduction of harm to the population as a whole based on scientific evidence of the highest standard that is made available for scrutiny and review by external independent scientists and relevant regulatory bodies and 

• to advocate for the development of sciencebased regulatory frameworks for the development and commercialization of rrps including the communication of scientifically substantiated information to enable adult smokers to make better consumer choices 

our rrp platforms our product development is based on the elimination of combustion via tobacco heating and other innovative systems for aerosol generation which we believe is the most promising path to providing a better consumer choice for those who would otherwise continue to smoke we recognize that no single product will appeal to all adult smokers therefore we are developing a portfolio of products intended to appeal to a variety of distinct adult consumer preferences 

four pmideveloped rrp platforms are in various stages of development and commercialization readiness 

platform 1 uses a precisely controlled heating device incorporating our iqos heatcontrol technology into which a specially designed and proprietary tobacco unit is inserted and heated to generate an aerosol we have conducted a series of clinical studies for this platform the results of which were included in our submission to the us food and drug administration “fda” described below we completed a 66month exposure response study and shared the results with the fda in april 2020 the study showed that for the group that switched to our platform 1 product the eight clinical risk endpoints that were tested as coprimary endpoints in the first sixmonth term moved in the same direction as observed for smoking cessation after 12 months of use of this product in addition we completed an 18month combined chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity study in mice which was ongoing at the time of our fda submission we shared the results with the fda in august 2018 

platform 2 uses a pressed carbon heat source which when ignited generates a nicotinecontaining aerosol by heating tobacco the results of our pharmacokinetic study that measured the nicotine pharmacokinetic profile as well as subjective effects and of our fiveday reduced exposure study indicate that this platform could be an acceptable substitute for adult smokers who seek an alternative to cigarettes the reduced exposure study results showed a substantial reduction in relevant biomarkers of exposure to the measured hphcs in those who switched to platform 2 compared to those who continued to smoke cigarettes over a fiveday period the sustainability of this reduction as well as changes in clinical risk markers were assessed in a threemonth reduced exposure study which was completed in 2018 

platform 3 provides an aerosol of nicotine salt we have explored two routes for this platform one with electronics and one without and conducted nicotine pharmacokinetic studies with both versions the results of our pharmacokinetic study related to the version without electronics indicate this products potential as an acceptable alternative to continued cigarette smoking in terms of product satisfaction in february 2020 we completed a product use and adaptation study in adult smokers for the product variant without electronics 

platform 4 covers evapor products which are batterypowered devices that produce an aerosol by vaporizing a nicotinecontaining liquid solution in 2020 our evapor products comprised devices with the “coil and wick” technology as well as our evapor mesh technology designed to ensure the consistency and quality of the generated aerosol compared to the products with the “coil and wick” technology recently we discontinued the commercialization of devices with the “coil and wick” technology we conducted a nicotine pharmacokinetic study with respect to products with our evapor mesh technology in 2017 the results of this study indicate that these products are an effective means of nicotine delivery while being a satisfying alternative for ecigarette users in march 2019 a sixmonth preclinical study in mice evaluating the impact of ecigarette vapor on the risks of pulmonary and cardiovascular disease compared to cigarette smoke was completed this study did not pertain to a specific product the study demonstrated that ecigarette vapors induce significantly lower biological responses associated with cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases compared with cigarette smoke 

after we receive the results of our scientific studies mentioned above in accordance with standard scientific practices we intend to share the conclusions in scientific forums and to submit them for inclusion in peerreviewed publications 

the research and development expense for our rrp portfolio accounted for 99 98 and 92 of our total research and development expense for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively the research and development expense for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 is set forth in item 8 note 14 additional information to the consolidated financial statements 

commercialization of rrps we are building a new product category and tailor our commercialization strategy to the characteristics of each specific market we focus our commercialization efforts on consumer retail experience guided consumer trials and customer care and increasingly digital communication programs and ecommerce in order to accelerate switching to our platform 1 products our initial market introductions typically entail onetoone consumer engagement in person or by digital means and device discounts these initial commercialization efforts require substantial investment which we believe will moderate over time and further benefit from the increased use of digital engagement capabilities during the covid19 pandemic we accelerated our investments in and pivot to digital consumer engagement 

in 2014 we introduced our platform 1 product in pilot city launches in nagoya japan and in milan italy since then we have continuously expanded our commercialization activities and as of december 31 2020 the product has been commercialized in 64 markets in key cities or nationwide while our platform 1 products are currently available for sale in mexico that country banned the importation of ecigarettes and devices that heat tobacco 

we believe that only a very small percentage of adult smokers who convert to our platform 1 product switch back to cigarettes 

we have integrated the production of our heated tobacco units into a number of our existing manufacturing facilities are progressing with our plans to build manufacturing capacity for our other rrp platforms and continue to optimize our manufacturing infrastructure 

an adequate supply chain for our rrp portfolio including the supply of electronic devices is important to our business we work with two electronics manufacturing service providers for the supply of our platform 1 and iqos veev devices and a small number of other providers for other products in our rrp portfolio and related accessories due to the covid19 pandemic the operations of our two electronic manufacturing service providers were temporarily suspended at different times even though these suspensions did not materially affect our operations if both of these service providers were significantly constrained at the same time the supply of the devices could be disrupted although we work closely with these service providers on monitoring their production capability and financial health we cannot guarantee that they will remain capable of meeting their commitments particularly during the covid19 pandemic if they will not the commercialization of our rrps could be adversely affected the production of our rrp portfolio requires various metals and we believe that there is an adequate supply of such metals in the world markets to satisfy our current and anticipated production requirements however some components and materials necessary for the production of our rrps including those for the electronic devices are obtained from single or limited sources and can be subject to industrywide shortages and price fluctuations while we were successful in maintaining adequate supply of such components and materials so far we may not be able to secure such supply going forward particularly during the covid19 pandemic this could negatively impact the commercialization of our rrps for details on the impact of covid19 on our production and supply chain see the  executive summary  section within this item 7 of this form 10k 

our platform 1 and iqos veev devices are subject to standard product warranties generally for a period of 12 months from the date of purchase or such other periods as required by law we discuss product warranties in more detail in item 8 note 5 product warranty  the significance of warranty claims is dependent on a number of factors including device version mix product failure rates logistics and service delivery costs and warranty policies and may increase with the number of devices sold 

product quality may affect consumer acceptance of our rrps 

our commercialization efforts for the other rrp platforms are as follows 

• in 2020 we started commercializing an improved version of our iqos mesh product in new zealand and the czech republic under the iqos veev brand name we currently plan to launch this product in additional markets under the iqos veev or veev brand names 

• with respect to teeps  our platform 2 product we are finalizing our improvements to this product and plan to conduct a consumer test in 2021 

• following the consumer test conducted in 2020 and the results of the product use and adaptation study described above we are incorporating our learnings into our plans to improve our platform 3 product 

due to the covid19 pandemic these plans may be delayed 

rrp regulation and taxation rrps contain nicotine and are not riskfree as we describe in more detail above we support sciencebased regulation and taxation of rrps and believe that regulation and taxation should differentiate between cigarettes and products that present are likely to present or have the potential to present less risk of harm to adult smokers who switch to these products versus continued smoking and should recognize a continuum of risk for tobacco and other nicotinecontaining products regulation as well as industry practices should reflect the fact that youth should not consume nicotine in any form 

some governments have banned or are seeking to ban or severely restrict emerging tobacco and nicotinecontaining products such as our rrps and communication of truthful and nonmisleading information about such products for example the commercialization of ecigarettes and heatnotburn products is prohibited in australia the commercialization of ecigarettes is prohibited in argentina the importation of ecigarettes and heatnotburn products is prohibited in turkey and the importation of ecigarettes and devices that heat tobacco is prohibited in mexico 

these regulations might foreclose or unreasonably restrict adult consumer access even to products that might be shown to be a better consumer choice than continuing to smoke during the covid19 pandemic governments may temporarily be unable to focus on the development of sciencebased regulatory frameworks for the development and commercialization of rrps or on the enforcement or implementation of regulations that are significant to our business 

we oppose blanket bans and unreasonable restrictions of products that have the potential to present less risk of harm compared to continued smoking by contrast we support regulation that sets clear standards for all rrp categories and propels innovation to benefit adult smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke 

in the united states an established regulatory framework for assessing “modified risk tobacco products” and “new tobacco products” exists under the jurisdiction of the fda we submitted to the fda a modified risk tobacco product application “mrtpa” for our platform 1 product in december 2016 and a premarket tobacco product application “pmta” for our platform 1 product in march 2017 

on april 30 2019 the fda determined that a version of our platform 1 product namely iqos 24 and three related consumables is appropriate for the protection of public health and authorized it for sale in the united states the fda’s decision followed its comprehensive assessment of our pmta on december 7 2020 the fda reached the same determination for the iqos 3 device and authorized that version of our platform 1 product for sale in the united states 

on july 7 2020 the fda determined that the available scientific evidence demonstrates that the issuance of an exposure modification order would be appropriate for the promotion of public health and authorized the marketing of a version of our platform 1 product namely iqos 24 and three related consumables as a modified risk tobacco product the fda authorized the marketing of this product in the us with the following information 

available evidence to date 

• the iqos system heats tobacco but does not burn it 

• this significantly reduces the production of harmful and potentially harmful chemicals 

• scientific studies have shown that switching completely from conventional cigarettes to the iqos system significantly reduces your body’s exposure to harmful or potentially harmful chemicals 

we must request and receive authorization from the fda in order to continue marketing this product with the same modified exposure information after the present order expires in four years 

there are two types of mrtp orders the fda may issue a “risk modification” order or an “exposure modification” order we had requested both types of orders after review the fda determined that the evidence did not support issuing a risk modification order at this time but that it did support issuing an exposure modification order for the product this determination included a finding that issuance of the exposure modification order is expected to benefit the health of the population as a whole 

we look forward to working with the fda to provide any additional information they may require in order to market this product with reduced risk claims 

the fda’s pmta and mrtp orders do not mean that the agency “approved” our platform 1 product these authorizations are subject to strict marketing reporting and other requirements and are not a guarantee that the product will remain authorized particularly if there is a significant uptake in youth or nonsmoker initiation the fda will monitor the marketing of the product 

some states and municipalities in the us have introduced severe restrictions for the sale of certain ecigarettes and tobacco products including those authorized by the fda we believe that such restrictions on fdaauthorized products will not advance public health and will unreasonably limit adult consumer access to products that are shown to be a better alternative to continued smoking 

in march 2020 we requested a clarification from the fda regarding the applicability of its new health warning requirements to our heated tobacco units sold in the united states 

in the us tobacco and nicotinecontaining products that were not commercially marketed as of february 15 2007 are subject to review and authorization by the fda manufacturers of all nonauthorized products currently on the market were required to file a pmta with the fda by september 9 2020 the fda announced on september 9 2020 that it will prioritize enforcement against any tobacco and nicotinecontaining product sold without a pmta 

fda actions may influence the regulatory approach of other governments 

until recently there were no countries with specific product standards for heatnotburn products currently national standards setting minimum quality and safety requirements for such products have been adopted in several countries with technical heatnotburn specifications andor methods for demonstrating the absence of combustion they are mandatory in egypt jordan saudi arabia tunisia and the uae and voluntary in the uk russia ukraine kazakhstan kyrgyzstan vietnam and indonesia in japan a voluntary standard sets minimum safety requirements for tobacco heating devices we expect other governments to consider similar product standards and encourage making them mandatory 

all eu member states have transposed the eu tobacco products directive including the provisions on novel tobacco products such as heated tobacco units and ecigarettes most of the eu member states require a notification submitted six months before the intended placing on the market of a novel tobacco product while some require premarket authorizations for the introduction of such products to date we have filed a comprehensive dossier summarizing our scientific assessment of our platform 1 product in over 20 member states 

in addition in italy in april 2018 we submitted an application for heets  used with the iqos device requesting regulatory recognition of the reduction of toxic substances and potential risk reduction resulting from switching to this product compared to continued cigarette smoking in january 2019 our application was not granted primarily on the grounds of insufficient data and questions of methodology due to the constraints of the review process we had been unable to supplement the application with all the data we subsequently filed with the fda and to address methodological questions during the review we plan to submit a new application where we will clarify the concerns raised by the decision and further strengthen our application by submitting additional evidence that became available since we submitted our first application consistent with our fda filings we are confident that our evidence supports our application 

on october 31 2019 our australian subsidiary philip morris limited “pml” submitted an application to the scheduling committee of the therapeutic goods administration of australia “tga” seeking to exempt heated tobacco products from being prohibited in australia in august 2020 the tga issued its decision denying the application and stating that it did not present compelling evidence to establish a public health benefit from greater access to nicotine in heated tobacco products 

to date several governmental agencies have published their scientific findings that analyze the harmreduction potential of certain rrps versus continuing smoking including 

in december 2017 at the request of the uk department of health and public health england the uk committee on toxicity published its assessment of the risk of heatnotburn products relative to cigarette smoking this assessment included analysis of scientific data for two heatnotburn products one of which was our platform 1 product the assessment concluded that while still harmful to health compared with the known risks from cigarettes heatnotburn products are probably less harmful subsequently in february 2018 public health england published a report stating that the available evidence suggests that heatnotburn products may be considerably less harmful than cigarettes and more harmful than ecigarettes 

in may 2018 the german federal institute for risk assessment “bfr” published a study on the platform 1 aerosol relative to cigarette smoke using the health canada intense smoking regimen bfr found reductions in selected hphcs in a range of 8099 this publication indicates that significant reductions in the levels of selected toxicants are likely to reduce toxicant exposure which bfr stated might be regarded as a discrete benefit compared to combustible cigarettes 

in may 2018 the dutch national institute for public health and environment “rivm” published a factsheet on novel tobacco products that heat rather than burn tobacco focusing on our platform 1 product rivm analyzed the aerosol generated by our platform 1 product and concluded that the use of this product while still harmful to health is probably less harmful than continued smoking 

in june 2018 the korean food and drug administration “kfda” issued a statement on products that heat rather than burn tobacco the kfda tested three heatnotburn products one of which was our platform 1 product the kfda confirmed that the levels of the nine hphcs tested in the aerosol of these products were on average approximately 90 lower compared to those measured in the cigarette smoke of the top five cigarette brands in south korea however the kfda stated that it could not establish that the tested heatnotburn products are less harmful than cigarettes in october 2018 our korean subsidiary filed a request with a local court seeking information underlying kfda’s analysis conclusions and public statements in may 2020 the court ordered kfda to produce certain records 

in august 2018 the science  technology committee of the uk house of commons published a report of its inquiry into ecigarettes and heatnotburn products the report concluded that ecigarettes are significantly less harmful to health than smoking tobacco the report also observed that for those smokers who do not accept ecigarettes heatnotburn products may offer a public health benefit despite their relative risk the report called for a riskproportionate regulatory environment for both ecigarettes and heatnotburn products and noted that ecigarettes should remain the least taxed cigarettes the most taxed with heatnotburn products falling between the two the uk committee on advertising practice announced the removal of a prohibition of health claims in the advertising of ecigarettes in the uk effective november 2018 

in november 2018 the eurasian economic commission regulatory body of the eurasian union consisting of armenia belarus kazakhstan kyrgyzstan and russia published the results of its commissioned study on novel nicotinecontaining products including our platform 1 product the study confirms significantly lower levels of hphcs in the aerosol generated by this product compared to cigarette smoke 

in january 2019 scientific media published the results of the study of the china national tobacco quality supervision and test centre “cntqst” comparing the aerosol generated by our platform 1 product with cigarette smoke the cntqst found that the former contained fewer and lower levels of harmful constituents than the latter and concluded that the lower temperature of heating tobacco in our platform 1 product contributed to the difference the cntqst stated that the reduction in emissions of harmful constituents cannot be interpreted as equivalent to a proportionate harmrisk reduction for smokers 

the foregoing scientific findings of government agencies may not be indicative of the measures that the relevant government authorities could take in regulating our products 

we make our scientific findings publicly available for scrutiny and peer review through several channels including our websites from time to time adult consumers competitors members of the scientific community and others inquire into our scientific methodologies challenge our scientific conclusions or request further study of certain aspects of our rrps and their health effects we are committed to a robust and open scientific debate and believe that such debate should be based on accurate and reliable scientific information we seek to provide accurate and reliable scientific information about our rrps nonetheless we may not be able to prevent thirdparty dissemination of false misleading or unsubstantiated information about these products the dissemination of scientifically unsubstantiated information or studies with a strong confirmation bias by third parties may cause confusion among adult smokers and affect their decision to switch to better alternatives to continued smoking such as our rrps 

to date we have been largely successful in demonstrating to regulators that our heated tobacco units are not cigarettes due to the absence of combustion and as such they are generally taxed either as a separate category or as other tobacco products which typically yields more favorable tax rates than cigarettes although we believe that this is sensible from the public health perspective we cannot guarantee that regulators will continue this approach 

there can be no assurance that we will succeed in our efforts to replace cigarettes with rrps or that regulation will allow us to commercialize rrps in all markets to communicate about our rrps including making scientifically substantiated riskreduction claims or to treat rrps differently from cigarettes 

legal challenges to rrps we face various administrative and legal challenges related to certain rrp activities including allegations concerning product classification advertising restrictions corporate communications product coach activities scientific substantiation product liability and unfair competition while we design our programs to comply with relevant regulations we expect these or similar challenges to continue as we expand our efforts to commercialize rrps and to communicate publicly the outcomes of these matters may affect our rrp commercialization and public communication activities and performance in one or more markets

trade policy 

we are subject to various trade restrictions imposed by the united states of america and countries in which we do business “trade sanctions” including the trade and economic sanctions administered by the us department of the treasurys office of foreign assets control and the us department of state it is our policy to comply fully with these trade sanctions 

tobacco products are agricultural products under us law and are not technological or strategic in nature from time to time we make sales in countries subject to trade sanctions either where such sanctions do not apply to our business or pursuant to exemptions or licenses 

a subsidiary sells products to distributors that in turn sell those products to duty free customers that supply un peacekeeping forces around the world including those in the un peacekeeping mission located in abyei a special administrative territory in sudan we do not believe that these sales which are not subject to trade sanctions and are de minimis in volume and value present a material risk to our shareholders our reputation or the value of our shares we have no employees operations or assets in sudan 

we do not sell products in iran north korea and syria from time to time we explore opportunities to sell our products in one or more of these countries as permitted by law 

we sell cigarettes in cuba under a distribution agreement these sales are permitted by us law under a license exception for agricultural commodities issued by the united states department of commerce bureau of industry and security granted to our distributor 

certain states within the us have enacted legislation permitting or requiring state pension funds to divest or abstain from future investment in stocks of companies that do business with certain countries that are sanctioned by the us because we do business in certain of these countries these state pension funds may have divested of our stock or may not invest in our stock we do not believe such legislation has had a material effect on the price of our shares

financial review 



2020 compared with 2019 

• net cash provided by operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2020 decreased by 03 billion compared with 2019 excluding unfavorable currency movements of 05 billion net cash provided by operating activities increased by 02 billion due primarily to higher net earnings excluding 2019 noncash charges related to the canadian tobacco litigationrelated expense and the loss on deconsolidation of rbh partially offset by higher working capital requirements of 05 billion and higher cash payments in 2020 for asset impairment and exit costs for further details see item 8 note 19 asset impairment and exit costs for additional information 

higher net earnings in 2020 excluding the impact of the above 2019 noncash charges were partly attributable to the russia excise and vat audit charge of 374 million which was paid in the third quarter of 2019 for further details item 8 note 17 contingencies for additional information 

the higher working capital requirements were primarily due to net cash used in inventories and accrued liabilities and other current assets reflecting covid19 pandemic related buildup of inventory in our supply chain and the timing of excise taxpaid inventory movements and excise tax payments this change was partially offset by cash provided by accounts receivable due to the varying levels of usage of our factoring arrangements to sell trade receivables and timing of sales and cash collections 

• net cash used in investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities of 12 billion for the year ended december 31 2020 decreased by 07 billion from the comparable 2019 period this decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the reduction of cash in 2019 resulting from the deconsolidation of rbh and lower capital expenditures partially offset by higher cash collateral posted to secure derivatives designated as net investment hedges of euro assets principally related to changes in exchange rates between the euro and the us dollar for further details on deconsolidation of rbh see item 8 note 20 deconsolidation of rbh  for further details on 

our derivatives designated as net investment hedges see item 8 note 15 financial instruments  

our capital expenditures were 06 billion in 2020 and 09 billion in 2019 the 2020 expenditures were primarily related to our ongoing investments in rrps we expect total capital expenditures in 2021 of approximately 08 billion including capital expenditures related to our ongoing investment in rrps to be funded by operating cash flows 

• net cash used in financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities of 85 billion for the year ended december 31 2020 increased by 04 billion from the comparable 2019 period the change was due primarily to higher payments to noncontrolling interests and higher dividends paid partially offset by debt activity 

dividends paid in 2020 and 2019 were 74 billion and 72 billion respectively 

2019 compared with 2018 

for a discussion comparing our net cash activities operating investing and financing for the year ended december 31 2019 with the year ended december 31 2018 refer to part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  financial review in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2019 which was filed with the us securities and exchange commission on february 7 2020 

debt and liquidity 

we define cash and cash equivalents as shortterm highly liquid investments readily convertible to known amounts of cash that mature within a maximum of three months and have an insignificant risk of change in value due to interest rate or credit risk changes as a policy we do not hold any investments in structured or equitylinked products our cash and cash equivalents are predominantly held in demand deposits with institutions that have investmentgrade longterm credit rating as part of our cash management strategy and in order to manage counterparty exposure we also enter into reverse repurchase agreements such agreements are collateralized with government or corporate securities held by a custodial bank and at maturity cash is paid back to pmi and the collateral is returned to the bank for 2020 and 2019 the activities for such reverse repurchase agreements were not material 

we utilize longterm and shortterm debt financing including a commercial paper program that is regularly used to finance ongoing liquidity requirements as part of our overall cash management strategy our ability to access the capital and credit markets as well as overall dynamics of these markets may impact borrowing costs we expect that the combination of our longterm and shortterm debt financing the commercial paper program and the committed credit facilities coupled with our operating cash flows will enable us to meet our liquidity requirements 

credit ratings – the cost and terms of our financing arrangements as well as our access to commercial paper markets may be affected by applicable credit ratings at february 8 2021 our credit ratings and outlook by major credit rating agencies were as follows

during 2020 2019 and 2018 we did not repurchase any shares under a share repurchase program 

dividends paid in 2020 were 74 billion during the third quarter of 2020 our board of directors approved a 26 increase in the quarterly dividend to 120 per common share as a result the present annualized dividend rate is 480 per common share 

market risk 

counterparty risk  we predominantly work with financial institutions with strong short and longterm credit ratings as assigned by standard  poor’s and moody’s these banks are also part of a defined group of relationship banks noninvestment grade institutions are only used in certain emerging markets to the extent required by local business needs we have a conservative approach when it comes to choosing financial counterparties and financial instruments as such we do not invest or hold investments in any structured or equitylinked products the majority of our cash and cash equivalents is currently invested with maturities of less than 30 days 

we continuously monitor and assess the credit worthiness of all our counterparties 

derivative financial instruments  we operate in markets outside of the united states of america with manufacturing and sales facilities in various locations throughout the world consequently we use certain financial instruments to manage our foreign currency and interest rate exposure we use derivative financial instruments principally to reduce our exposure to market risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates by creating offsetting exposures we are not a party to leveraged derivatives and by policy do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 

see item 8 note 15 financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements for further details on our derivative financial instruments and the related collateral arrangements 

value at risk  we use a value at risk computation to estimate the potential oneday loss in the fair value of our interestratesensitive and foreign currency pricesensitive derivative financial instruments this computation includes our debt and foreign currency forwards swaps and options anticipated transactions foreign currency trade payables and receivables and net investments in foreign subsidiaries which the foregoing instruments are intended to hedge were excluded from the computation 

the computation estimates were made assuming normal market conditions using a 95 confidence interval and a oneday holding period using a parametric deltagamma approximation technique to determine the observed interrelationships between movements in interest rates and various currencies and in calculating the risk of the underlying positions in the portfolio these interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate and forward currency rate movements primarily over the preceding quarter for determining value at risk at december 31 2020 and 2019 and primarily over each of the four preceding quarters for the calculation of average high and low value at risk amounts during each year 



the significant yearoveryear increase in average and high impact on the value at risk computation above was primarily due to an increase in interest rate and foreign currency volatility during the first quarter of 2020 resulting from the impact of the covid19 pandemic 

the value at risk computation is a risk analysis tool designed to statistically estimate the maximum probable daily loss from adverse movements in interest and foreign currency rates under normal market conditions the computation does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value or earnings to be incurred by us nor does it consider the effect of favorable changes in market rates we cannot predict actual future movements in such market rates and do not present these results to be indicative of future movements in market rates or to be representative of any actual impact that future changes in market rates may have on our future results of operations or financial position

general development of business 

  

general 

  

philip morris international inc is a virginia holding company incorporated in 1987 we are a leading international tobacco company engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes smokefree products and associated electronic devices and accessories and other nicotinecontaining products in markets outside the united states of america in addition we ship a version of our platform 1 device and its consumables authorized by the us food and drug administration fda to altria group inc for sale in the united states under license 

we are leading a transformation in the tobacco industry to create a smokefree future based on a new category of reducedrisk products that while not risk free are a much better choice than continuing to smoke our goal is to ultimately replace cigarettes with smokefree products to the benefit of adults who would otherwise continue to smoke society the company and its shareholders 

reducedrisk products rrps is the term we use to refer to products that present are likely to present or have the potential to present less risk of harm to smokers who switch to these products versus continuing smoking we have a range of rrps in various stages of development scientific assessment and commercialization because our rrps do not burn tobacco they produce an aerosol that contains far lower quantities of harmful and potentially harmful constituents than found in cigarette smoke through multidisciplinary capabilities in product development stateoftheart facilities and scientific substantiation we aim to ensure that our rrps meet adult consumer preferences and rigorous regulatory requirements 

our iqos smokefree product brand portfolio includes heated tobacco and nicotinecontaining vapor products our leading smokefree platform platform 1 is a precisely controlled device into which a specially designed heated tobacco unit is inserted and heated to generate an aerosol we market our heated tobacco units under the brand names heets  heets marlboro and heets from marlboro  defined collectively as heets  as well as marlboro heatsticks and parliament heatsticks  platform 1 was first introduced in nagoya japan in 2014 as of december 31 2019 platform 1 is available for sale in 52 markets in key cities or nationwide 

our cigarettes are sold in more than 180 markets and in many of these markets they hold the number one or number two market share position we have a wide range of premium midprice and lowprice brands our portfolio comprises both international and local brands and is led by marlboro  the world’s bestselling international cigarette which accounted for approximately 37 of our total 2019 cigarette shipment volume marlboro is complemented in the premiumprice category by parliament  our other leading international cigarette brands are bond street chesterfield lm  lark and philip morris these seven international cigarette brands contributed approximately 78 of our cigarette shipment volume in 2019  we also own a number of important local cigarette brands such as dji sam soe  sampoerna a and sampoerna u in indonesia and fortune and jackpot in the philippines

we are a legal entity separate and distinct from our direct and indirect subsidiaries accordingly our right and thus the right of our creditors and stockholders to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of any subsidiary is subject to the prior rights of creditors of such subsidiary except to the extent that claims of our company itself as a creditor may be recognized as a holding company our principal sources of funds including funds to make payment on our debt securities are from the receipt of dividends and repayment of debt from our subsidiaries our principal wholly owned and majorityowned subsidiaries currently are not limited by longterm debt or other agreements in their ability to pay cash dividends or to make other distributions with respect to their common stock that are otherwise compliant with law 

  

description of business 

  

we manage our business in six operating segments as follows 



 

as of march 22 2019  we deconsolidated the financial results of our canadian subsidiary rothmans benson  hedges inc rbh from our financial statements for further details see item 8 note 22 deconsolidation of rbh  

following the deconsolidation of our canadian subsidiary we will continue to report the volume of brands sold by rbh for which other pmi subsidiaries are the trademark owners these include heets  next  philip morris and rooftop  which together accounted for approximately 40 of rbhs total shipment volume in 2018 

references to total international market defined as worldwide cigarette and heated tobacco unit volume excluding the united states total industry total market and market shares in this form 10k are our estimates for taxpaid products based on the latest available data from a number of internal and external sources and may in defined instances exclude the peoples republic of china andor our duty free business in addition to reflect the deconsolidation of rbh effective march 22 2019 pmis total market share has been restated for previous periods 

our total shipments including cigarettes and heated tobacco units decreased by 20 in 2019 to 7664 billion units we estimate that international industry volumes including cigarettes and heated tobacco units were approximately 51 trillion units in 2019  a 09 decrease from 2018  excluding the people’s republic of china “prc” we estimate that international cigarette and heated tobacco unit volume was 27 trillion units in 2019  a 20 decrease from 2018  we estimate that our reported share of the international market which is defined as worldwide cigarette and heated tobacco unit volume excluding the united states of america was approximately 151 in 2019  152 in 2018 and 151 in 2017  excluding the prc we estimate that our reported share of the international market was approximately 284  283  and 278 in 2019  2018 and 2017  respectively 

  

shipments of our principal cigarette brand marlboro  decreased by 06 in 2019 and represented approximately 100 of the international cigarette market excluding the prc in 2019  97 in 2018 and 97 in 2017  

  

total shipment volume of heated tobacco units reached 597 billion units in 2019  up from 414 billion units in 2018  

we have a market share of at least 15 and in a number of instances substantially more than 15 in approximately 95 markets including algeria argentina australia austria belgium brazil the czech republic egypt france germany hong kong hungary indonesia israel italy japan kazakhstan korea kuwait mexico the netherlands the philippines poland portugal russia saudi arabia the slovak republic spain switzerland turkey and ukraine 

  

distribution  sales 

our main types of distribution are tailored to the characteristics of each market and are often used simultaneously 

  

   

competition 

  

we are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business we compete primarily on the basis of product quality brand recognition brand loyalty taste rd innovation packaging customer service marketing advertising and retail price and increasingly adult smoker willingness to convert to our rrps in the combustible product category we predominantly sell american blend cigarette brands such as marlboro  lm  parliament philip morris and chesterfield  which are the most popular across many of our markets in the rrp product category we predominantly sell platform 1 devices and heated tobacco units under the iqos brand umbrella we seek to compete in all profitable retail price categories although our brand portfolio is weighted towards the premiumprice category 

the competitive environment and our competitive position can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions erosion of consumer confidence competitors introduction of lowerprice products or innovative products higher tobacco product taxes higher absolute prices and larger gaps between retail price categories and product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate tobacco products and restricts adult consumer access to truthful and nonmisleading information about our rrps competitors include three large international tobacco companies new market entrants particularly with respect to innovative products several regional and local tobacco companies and in some instances stateowned tobacco enterprises principally in algeria egypt the prc taiwan thailand and vietnam industry consolidation and privatizations of stateowned enterprises have led to an overall increase in competitive pressures some competitors have different profit and volume objectives and some international competitors are susceptible to changes in different currency exchange rates certain new market entrants may alienate consumers from innovative products through inappropriate marketing campaigns and messaging and inferior product satisfaction while not relying on scientific substantiation based on appropriate rd protocols and standards the growing use of digital media could increase the speed and extent of the dissemination of inaccurate and misleading information about our rrps 

procurement and raw materials 

  

we purchase tobacco leaf of various types grades and styles throughout the world mostly through independent tobacco suppliers in 2019 we also contracted directly with farmers in several countries including argentina brazil colombia ecuador italy pakistan the philippines and poland in 2019 direct sourcing from farmers represented approximately 23 of pmi’s global leaf requirements the largest supplies of tobacco leaf are sourced from argentina brazil china italy indonesia mostly for domestic use in kretek products malawi mozambique the philippines turkey and the united states 

we believe that there is an adequate supply of tobacco leaf in the world markets to satisfy our current and anticipated production requirements 

in addition to tobacco leaf we purchase a wide variety of direct materials from a total of approximately 400 suppliers in 2019 our top ten suppliers of direct materials combined represented approximately 50 of our total direct materials purchases the three most significant direct materials that we purchase are printed paper board used in packaging acetate tow used in filter making and fine paper used in the manufacturing of cigarettes and heated tobacco units in addition the adequate supply and procurement of cloves are of particular importance to our indonesian business 

the adequate supply chain for our rrp portfolio including the supply of electronic devices is important to our business we work with two electronics manufacturing service providers for the supply of our platform 1 devices and a small number of other providers for other products in our rrp portfolio and related accessories although we work closely with these service providers on monitoring their 

production capability and financial health the commercialization of our rrps could be adversely affected if they are unable to meet their commitments the production of our rrp portfolio requires various metals and we believe that there is an adequate supply of such metals in the world markets to satisfy our current and anticipated production requirements however some components and materials necessary for the production of our rrps are obtained from single or limited sources and can be subject to industrywide shortages and price fluctuations our inability to secure an adequate supply of such components and materials could negatively impact the commercialization of our rrps 

our iqos devices are subject to product warranties which are described in more detail in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10k “item 8” in note 5 product warranty to our consolidated financial statements we discuss our rrp products in more detail in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this annual report on form 10k “item 7” in business environment—reducedrisk products

the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report on form 10k any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business our operating results our financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forwardlooking statements are made in this annual report on form 10k 

forwardlooking and cautionary statements 

we may from time to time make written or oral forwardlooking statements including statements contained in this annual report on form 10k and other filings with the sec in reports to stockholders and in press releases and investor webcasts you can identify these forwardlooking statements by use of words such as strategy expects continues plans anticipates believes will estimates intends projects goals targets and other words of similar meaning you can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 

we cannot guarantee that any forwardlooking statement will be realized although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions our rrps constitute a new product category in its early stages that is less predictable than our mature cigarette business achievement of future results is subject to risks uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate actual results could vary materially from those anticipated estimated or projected investors should bear this in mind as they consider forwardlooking statements and whether to invest in or remain invested in our securities in connection with the “safe harbor” provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 we are identifying important factors that individually or in the aggregate could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements made by us any such statement is qualified by reference to the following cautionary statements we elaborate on these and other risks we face throughout this document particularly in item 7 business environment  you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors consequently you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties we do not undertake to update any forwardlooking statement that we may make from time to time except in the normal course of our public disclosure obligations 

risks related to our business and industry 

 this decline is due to multiple factors including increased taxes and pricing governmental actions the diminishing social acceptance of smoking continuing economic and geopolitical uncertainty and the continuing prevalence of illicit products these factors and their potential consequences are discussed more fully below and in item 7 business environment  

 tax regimes including excise taxes sales taxes and import duties can disproportionately affect the retail price of cigarettes versus other combustible tobacco products or disproportionately affect the relative retail price of our cigarette brands versus cigarette brands manufactured by certain of our competitors because our portfolio is weighted toward the premiumprice cigarette category tax regimes based on sales price can place us at a competitive disadvantage in certain markets as a result our volume and profitability may be adversely affected in these markets 

increases in cigarette taxes are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on our sales of cigarettes due to resulting lower consumption levels a shift in sales from manufactured cigarettes to other combustible tobacco products and from the premiumprice to the midprice or lowprice cigarette categories where we may be underrepresented from local sales to legal crossborder purchases of lower price products or to illicit products such as contraband counterfeit and illicit whites 

 governmental actions combined with the diminishing social acceptance of smoking and private actions to restrict smoking have resulted in reduced industry volume in many of our markets and we expect that such factors will continue to reduce consumption levels and will increase downtrading and the risk of counterfeiting contraband illicit whites and legal crossborder purchases significant regulatory developments will continue to take place over the next few years in most of our markets driven principally by the world health organizations framework convention on tobacco control “fctc” since it came into force in 2005 the fctc has led to increased efforts by tobacco control advocates and public health organizations to promote increasingly restrictive regulatory measures on the marketing and sale of tobacco products to adult smokers regulatory initiatives that have been proposed introduced or enacted include 



 our financial results could be significantly affected by regulatory initiatives resulting in a significant decrease in demand for our brands in particular requirements that lead to a commoditization of tobacco products or impede adult consumers ability to convert to our rrps as well as any significant increase in the cost of complying with new regulatory requirements 

 

there is litigation related to tobacco products pending in certain jurisdictions damages claimed in some tobaccorelated litigation are significant and in certain cases in brazil canada and nigeria range into the billions of us dollars we anticipate that new cases will continue to be filed the fctc encourages litigation against tobacco product manufacturers it is possible that our consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation see item 8 note 18 contingencies to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of pending litigation and item 7 business environment—reducedrisk products rrps—legal challenges to rrps 

 we compete primarily on the basis of product quality brand recognition brand loyalty taste rd innovation packaging customer service marketing advertising and retail price and increasingly adult smoker willingness to convert to our rrps we are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business the competitive environment and our competitive position can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions erosion of consumer confidence competitors introduction of lowerprice products or innovative products higher tobacco product taxes higher absolute prices and larger gaps between retail price categories and product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate tobacco products and restricts adult consumer access to truthful and nonmisleading information about our rrps competitors include three large international tobacco companies new market entrants particularly with respect to innovative products several regional and local tobacco companies and in some instances stateowned tobacco enterprises principally in algeria egypt the prc taiwan thailand and vietnam industry consolidation and privatizations of stateowned enterprises have led to an overall increase in competitive pressures some competitors have different profit and volume objectives and some international competitors are susceptible to changes in different currency exchange rates certain new market entrants may alienate consumers from innovative products through inappropriate marketing campaigns and messaging and inferior product satisfaction while not relying on scientific substantiation based on appropriate rd protocols and standards the growing use of digital media could increase the speed and extent of the dissemination of inaccurate and misleading information about our rrps 

 some of the countries in which we operate face the threat of civil unrest and can be subject to regime changes in others nationalization terrorism conflict and the threat of war may have a significant impact on the business environment natural disasters pandemics economic political regulatory or other developments could disrupt our supply chain manufacturing capabilities or distribution capabilities in addition such developments could lead to loss of property or equipment that are critical to our business in certain markets and difficulty in staffing and managing our operations which could reduce our volumes revenues and net earnings 

in certain markets we are dependent on governmental approvals of various actions such as price changes and failure to obtain such approvals could impair growth of our profitability 

in addition despite our high ethical standards and rigorous control and compliance procedures aimed at preventing and detecting unlawful conduct given the breadth and scope of our international operations we may not be able to detect all potential improper or unlawful conduct by our employees and partners 

 our business is subject to changes in adult consumer preferences which may be influenced by local economic conditions to be successful we must 

 in periods of economic uncertainty adult consumers may tend to purchase lowerprice brands and the volume of our premiumprice and midprice brands and our profitability could suffer accordingly such downtrading trends may be reinforced by regulation that limits branding communication and product differentiation 

 our rrps are novel products in a new category and the pace at which adult smokers adopt them may vary depending on the competitive regulatory fiscal and cultural environment and other factors in a specific market there may be periods of accelerated growth and periods of slower growth for these products the timing and drivers of which may be more difficult for us to predict versus our mature cigarette business the impact of this lower predictability on our projected results for a specific period may be significant particularly during the early stages of this new product category 

 large quantities of counterfeit cigarettes are sold in the international market we believe that marlboro is the most heavily counterfeited international cigarette brand although we cannot quantify the revenues we lose as a result of this activity in addition our revenues are reduced by contraband legal crossborder purchases “illicit whites” and nontaxpaid volume produced by local manufacturers our revenues and consumer satisfaction with our platform 1 device and heated tobacco units may be adversely affected by counterfeit products that do not meet our product quality standards and scientific validation procedures 

 investigations include allegations of contraband shipments of cigarettes allegations of unlawful pricing activities within certain markets allegations of underpayment of income taxes customs duties andor excise taxes allegations of false and misleading usage of descriptors allegations of unlawful advertising and allegations of unlawful labor practices we cannot predict the outcome of those investigations or whether additional investigations may be commenced and it is possible that our business could be materially affected by an unfavorable outcome of pending or future investigations see item 8 note 18 contingencies—other litigation and item 7 business environment—governmental investigations for a description of certain governmental investigations to which we are subject 

 

our key strategic priorities are to develop and commercialize products that present less risk of harm to adult smokers who switch to those products versus continued smoking and to convince current adult smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke to switch to those rrps for our efforts to be successful we must develop rrps that such adult smokers find acceptable alternatives to smoking conduct rigorous scientific studies to substantiate that they reduce exposure to harmful and potentially harmful constituents in smoke and ultimately that these products present are likely to present or have the potential to present less risk of harm to adult smokers who switch to them versus continued smoking and effectively advocate for the development of sciencebased regulatory frameworks for the development and commercialization of rrps including communication of scientifically substantiated information to enable adult smokers to make better consumer choices we might not succeed in our efforts if we do not succeed but others do or if heatnotburn products are inequitably regulated compared to other rrp categories without regard to the totality of the scientific evidence available for such products we may be at a competitive disadvantage in addition actions of some market entrants such as the inappropriate marketing of evapor products to youth as well as alleged health consequences associated with the use of certain evapor products may unfavorably impact public opinion andor mischaracterize all evapor products or other rrps to consumers regulators and policy makers 

without regard to the totality of scientific evidence for specific products this may impede our efforts to advocate for the development of sciencebased regulatory frameworks for the development and commercialization of rrps we cannot predict whether regulators will permit the sale andor marketing of rrps with scientifically substantiated riskreduction claims such restrictions could limit the success of our rrps moreover the fda’s premarket tobacco product authorization of a version of our platform 1 product is subject to strict marketing reporting and other requirements and is not a guarantee that the product will remain authorized particularly if there is a significant uptake in youth initiation 

 

to date we have been largely successful in demonstrating to regulators that our rrps are not cigarettes and as such they are generally taxed either as a separate category or as other tobacco products which typically yields more favorable tax rates than cigarettes if we cease to be successful in these efforts rrp unit margins may be adversely affected 

 we conduct our business primarily in local currency and for purposes of financial reporting the local currency results are translated into us dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period during times of a strengthening us dollar our reported net revenues operating income and eps will be reduced because the local currency translates into fewer us dollars during periods of local economic crises foreign currencies may be devalued significantly against the us dollar reducing our margins actions to recover margins may result in lower volume and a weaker competitive position 

 the tax cuts and jobs act that was signed into law in december 2017 constitutes a major change to the us tax system our estimated impact of the tax cuts and jobs act is based on management’s current interpretations and our analysis is ongoing our final tax liability may be materially different from current estimates due to developments such as implementing regulations and clarifications in future periods our effective tax rate and our ability to recover deferred tax assets could be subject to additional uncertainty as a result of such developments furthermore changes in the earnings mix or applicable foreign tax laws may result in significant variability in our effective tax rates because we are a us holding company our most significant source of funds is distributions from our nonus subsidiaries certain countries in which we operate have adopted or could institute currency exchange controls that limit or prohibit our local subsidiaries ability to convert local currency into us dollars or to make payments outside the country this could subject us to the risks of local currency devaluation and business disruption 

 our profit growth may suffer if we are unable to introduce new products or enter new markets successfully to raise prices or to improve the proportion of our sales of higher margin products and in higher margin geographies 

 one element of our growth strategy is to strengthen our brand portfolio and market positions through selective acquisitions and the development of strategic business relationships acquisition and strategic business development opportunities are limited and present risks of failing to achieve efficient and effective integration strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings there is no assurance that we will be able to acquire attractive businesses on favorable terms or that future acquisitions or strategic business developments will be accretive to earnings 

 as with other agricultural commodities the price of tobacco leaf and cloves can be influenced by imbalances in supply and demand and crop quality can be influenced by variations in weather patterns including those caused by climate change tobacco production in certain countries is subject to a variety of controls including government mandated prices and production control programs changes in the 

patterns of demand for agricultural products could cause farmers to produce less tobacco or cloves any significant change in tobacco leaf and clove prices quality and quantity could affect our profitability and our business 

 

to be successful we must continue transforming our culture and ways of working align our talent with our business needs innovate and transform to a consumercentric business we compete for talent including in areas that are new to us such as digital and technical solutions with companies in the consumer products technology and other sectors that enjoy greater societal acceptance as a result we may be unable to attract and retain the best global talent with the right degree of diversity experience and skills to achieve our strategic goals 

 we use information systems to help manage business processes collect and interpret data and communicate internally and externally with employees suppliers consumers customers and others some of these information systems are managed by thirdparty service providers we have backup systems and business continuity plans in place and we take care to protect our systems and data from unauthorized access nevertheless failure of our systems to function as intended or penetration of our systems by outside parties intent on extracting or corrupting information or otherwise disrupting business processes could place us at a competitive disadvantage result in a loss of revenue assets or personal or other sensitive data litigation and regulatory action cause damage to our reputation and that of our brands and result in significant remediation and other costs failure to protect personal data respect the rights of data subjects and adhere to strict cybersecurity protocols could subject us to substantial fines and other legal challenges under regulations such as the eu general data protection regulation as we are increasingly relying on digital platforms in our business the magnitude of these risks is likely to increase 

 our intellectual property rights are valuable assets and their protection is important to our business if the steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights globally including through a combination of trademark design patent and other intellectual property rights are inadequate or if others infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property rights notwithstanding legal protection our business could suffer intellectual property rights of third parties may limit our ability to introduce new products or improve the quality of existing products in one or more markets competitors or other third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property rights any such claims regardless of merit could divert management’s attention be costly disruptive timeconsuming and unpredictable and expose us to litigation costs and damages and impede our ability to manufacture and sell new products or improve existing products if as a result we are unable to manufacture or sell our rrps or improve their quality in one or more markets our ability to convert adult smokers to our rrps in such markets would be adversely affected 

 

in certain instances we contract with third parties to manufacture some of our products or product parts or to provide other services we may be unable to renew these agreements on satisfactory terms for numerous reasons including government regulations accordingly our costs may increase significantly if we must replace such third parties with our own resources

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this annual report on form 10k including the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in item 8 and the discussion of risks and cautionary factors that may affect future results in item 1a risk factors  



description of our company 

we are leading a transformation in the tobacco industry to create a smokefree future and ultimately replace cigarettes with smokefree products to the benefit of adults who would otherwise continue to smoke society the company and its shareholders we are a leading international tobacco company engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes as well as smokefree products and associated electronic devices and accessories and other nicotinecontaining products in markets outside the united states in addition we ship a version of our platform 1 device and its consumables authorized by the us food and drug administration fda to altria group inc for sale in the united states under license we are building a future on a new category of smokefree products that while not risk free are a much better choice than continuing to smoke through multidisciplinary capabilities in product development stateoftheart facilities and scientific substantiation we aim to ensure that our smokefree products meet adult consumer preferences and rigorous regulatory requirements our iqos smokefree product brand portfolio includes heatnotburn tobacco and nicotinecontaining vapor products 

we manage our business in six operating segments 

  

 

our cigarettes are sold in more than 180 markets and in many of these markets they hold the number one or number two market share position we have a wide range of premium midprice and lowprice brands our portfolio comprises both international and local brands in addition to the manufacture and sale of cigarettes we are engaged in the development and commercialization of reducedrisk products rrps rrps is the term we use to refer to products that present are likely to present or have the potential to present less risk of harm to smokers who switch to these products versus continuing smoking 

we use the term net revenues to refer to our operating revenues from the sale of our products including shipping and handling charges billed to customers net of sales and promotion incentives and excise taxes our net revenues and operating income are affected by various factors including the volume of products we sell the price of our products changes in currency exchange rates and the mix of products we sell mix is a term used to refer to the proportionate value of premiumprice brands to midprice or lowprice brands in any given market product mix mix can also refer to the proportion of shipment volume in more profitable markets versus shipment volume in less profitable markets geographic mix 

our cost of sales consists principally of tobacco leaf nontobacco raw materials labor and manufacturing costs shipping and handling costs and the cost of the iqos devices produced by thirdparty electronics manufacturing service providers estimated costs associated with iqos warranty programs are generally provided for in cost of sales in the period the related revenues are recognized 

our marketing administration and research costs include the costs of marketing and selling our products other costs generally not related to the manufacture of our products including general corporate expenses and costs incurred to develop new products the most significant components of our marketing administration and research costs are marketing and sales expenses and general and administrative expenses 

philip morris international inc is a legal entity separate and distinct from its direct and indirect subsidiaries accordingly our right and thus the right of our creditors and stockholders to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of any subsidiary is subject to the prior rights of creditors of such subsidiary except to the extent that claims of our company itself as a creditor may be recognized as a holding company our principal sources of funds including funds to make payment on our debt securities are from the receipt of 

dividends and repayment of debt from our subsidiaries our principal wholly owned and majorityowned subsidiaries currently are not limited by longterm debt or other agreements in their ability to pay cash dividends or to make other distributions with respect to their common stock that are otherwise compliant with law 

executive summary 

the following executive summary provides significant highlights from the discussion and analysis that follows 

consolidated operating results 

 

net revenues excluding unfavorable currency increased by 38  mainly reflecting a favorable pricing variance notably in germany indonesia japan the philippines and turkey and favorable volumemix mainly driven by heated tobacco unit and iqos device volume in the eu and russia and heated tobacco unit volume in japan partly offset by unfavorable volumemix of cigarettes notably in australia the eu indonesia japan and russia unfavorable heated tobacco unit volume in pmi duty free and unfavorable iqos device volume in japan and korea the currencyneutral growth in net revenues of 38 came despite the unfavorable impact of 763 million  shown in other above predominantly resulting from the deconsolidation of our canadian subsidiary rothmans benson  hedges inc rbh effective march 22 2019 for further details on the deconsolidation of rbh see item 8 note 18 contingencies and note 22 deconsolidation of rbh  

net revenues by product category for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  are shown below 

  

 

income taxes – the 2018 tax items that decreased our 2018 diluted eps by 002 per share in the table above represented a current income tax charge of 185 million primarily due to an increase in our final 2017 transition tax liability mostly offset by a deferred income tax benefit of 154 million primarily due to the recognition of deferred tax assets for net operating losses in the state of new york 

the 2019 tax items that increased our 2019 diluted eps by 004 per share in the table above was primarily due to a reduction in estimated us federal income tax on dividend repatriation for the years 20152018  67 million  

the change in the tax rate that decreased our diluted eps by 004 per share in the table above was primarily due to changes in earnings mix by taxing jurisdiction and us state deferred income tax expense partially offset by repatriation cost differences 

for further details see item 8 note 11 income taxes  

asset impairment and exit costs – as a part of the optimization of our global manufacturing infrastructure we recorded pretax asset impairment and exit costs of 422 million during 2019  representing 362 million net of income tax and a diluted eps charge of 023 per share this charge primarily related to a cigarette plant closure in berlin germany approximately 019 per share as well as the closure of a cigarette plant in argentina colombia and pakistan the total pretax charge was included in marketing administration and research costs on the consolidated statements of earnings for further details see item 8 note 21 asset impairment and exit costs  

canadian tobacco litigationrelated expense – in the first quarter of 2019 we recorded a pretax charge of 194 million  representing 142 million net of tax relating to the judgment against rbh in two québec smoking and health class actions the charge of 009 per share reflects our assessment of the portion of the judgment that represents probable and estimable loss prior to the deconsolidation of rbh and corresponds to the trust account deposit required by the judgment the total pretax charge was included in marketing administration and research costs on the consolidated statements of earnings and was included in the operating income of the latin america  canada segment for further details see item 8 note 18 contingencies and item 8 note 22 deconsolidation of rbh  

loss on deconsolidation of rbh – following the judgment in the two québec smoking and health class actions rbh obtained an initial order from the ontario superior court of justice granting it protection under the companies’ creditors arrangement act “ccaa” which is a canadian federal law that permits a canadian business to restructure its affairs while carrying on its business in the ordinary course with minimal disruption to its customers suppliers and employees the administration of the ccaa process principally relating to the powers provided to the court and the court appointed monitor removes certain elements of control of the business from both pmi and rbh as a result we have determined that we no longer have a controlling financial interest over rbh and that we do not exert significant influence over rbh under us gaap therefore we deconsolidated rbh as of the date of the ccaa filing on march 22 2019  and will account for our continuing investment in rbh as an equity security without readily determinable fair value 

a loss on the deconsolidation of rbh of 239 million was included in marketing administration and research costs on the consolidated statements of earnings and was included in the operating income of the latin america  canada segment the 012 per share impact also included a tax benefit of 49 million within the provision for income taxes as discussed above related to the reversal of a deferred tax liability on the unremitted earnings of rbh for further details see item 8 note 18 contingencies and item 8 note 22 deconsolidation of rbh  

russia excise and vat audit charge – as a result of the final tax assessment for the 20152017 financial years received by our russian affiliate in the third quarter of 2019 pmi recorded a pretax charge of 374 million in marketing administration and research costs in the consolidated statements of earnings representing 315 million net of income tax and a diluted eps charge of 020  the pretax charge of 374 million was included in the operating income of the eastern europe segment for further details see item 8 note 18 contingencies 

fair value adjustment for equity security investments – in the fourth quarter of 2019 pmi recorded a favorable fair value adjustment for its equity security investments of 35 million after tax or 002 per share increase in diluted eps the fair value adjustment for its equity security investments was included in equity investments and securities incomeloss net 44 million income and provision for income taxes 9 million expense on the consolidated statements of earnings in 2019 for further details see item 8 note 16 fair value measurements 

currency – the unfavorable currency impact during 2019 results from the fluctuations of the us dollar especially against the euro russian ruble and turkish lira this unfavorable currency movement has impacted our profitability across our primary revenue markets and local currency cost bases 

interest – the favorable impact of interest was due primarily to our ongoing efforts to optimize our capital structure following the passage of the us tax cuts and jobs act this included the decision to use existing cash to repay 25 billion and 40 billion of longterm debt that matured in 2018 and in 2019 respectively 

operations – the increase in diluted eps of 022 from our operations in the table above was due primarily to the following segments 

 partially offset by 

 

for further details see the consolidated operating results and operating results by business segment sections of the following discussion and analysis  

discussion and analysis 

critical accounting estimates 

item 8 note 2 summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in most instances we must use a particular accounting policy or method because it is the only one that is permitted under us gaap 

the preparation of financial statements requires that we use estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets liabilities net revenues and expenses as well as our disclosure of contingencies if actual amounts differ from previous estimates we include the revisions in our consolidated results of operations in the period during which we know the actual amounts historically aggregate differences if any between our estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 

the selection and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates have been discussed with our audit committee the following is a discussion of the more significant assumptions estimates accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition  we recognize revenue as performance obligations are satisfied our primary performance obligation is the distribution and sales of cigarettes and other nicotinecontaining products including reducedrisk products our performance obligations are typically satisfied upon shipment or delivery to our customers the company estimates the cost of sales returns based on historical experience and these estimates are immaterial estimated costs associated with warranty programs for iqos devices are generally provided for in cost of sales in the period the related revenues are recognized based on a number of factors including historical experience product failure rates and warranty policies the transaction price is typically based on the amount billed to the customer and includes estimated variable consideration where applicable such variable consideration is typically not constrained and is estimated based on the most likely amount that pmi expects to be entitled to under the terms of the contracts with customers historical experience of discount or rebate redemption where relevant and the terms of any underlying discount or rebate programs which may change from time to time as the business and product categories evolve 

inventories  our inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions the valuation of inventory also requires us to estimate obsolete and excess inventory we perform regular reviews of our inventory on hand as well as our future purchase commitments with our suppliers considering multiple factors including demand forecasts product life cycle current sales levels pricing strategy and cost trends if our review indicates that inventories of raw materials components or finished products have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or that inventory cost exceeds net realizable value we may be required to make adjustments that will impact the results of operations 

goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets valuation  we test goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events occur that would warrant such review while the company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment for both goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets to determine if it is more likely than not that an impairment exists the company elects to perform the quantitative assessment for our annual impairment analysis the impairment analysis involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit or nonamortizable intangible asset to the carrying value if the carrying value exceeds the fair value goodwill or a nonamortizable intangible asset is considered impaired to determine the fair value of goodwill we primarily use a discounted cash flow model supported by the market approach using earnings multiples of comparable global and local companies within the tobacco industry at december 31 2019  the carrying value of our goodwill was 59 billion  which is related to ten reporting units each of which consists of a group of markets with similar economic characteristics the estimated fair value of each of our ten reporting units exceeded the carrying value as of december 31 2019  to determine the fair value of nonamortizable intangible assets we primarily use a discounted cash flow model applying the relieffromroyalty method we concluded that the fair value of our nonamortizable intangible assets exceeded the carrying value these discounted cash flow models include management assumptions relevant for forecasting operating cash flows which are subject to changes in business conditions such as volumes and prices costs to produce discount rates and estimated capital needs management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the fair values are estimated and we believe these assumptions are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use since the march 28 2008 spinoff from altria group inc we have not recorded a charge to earnings for an impairment of goodwill or nonamortizable intangible assets 

marketing costs  we incur certain costs to support our products through programs that include advertising marketing consumer engagement and trade promotions the costs of our advertising and marketing programs are expensed in accordance with us gaap recognition of the cost related to our consumer engagement and trade promotion programs contain uncertainties due to the judgment 

required in estimating the potential performance and compliance for each program for volumebased incentives provided to customers management continually assesses and estimates by customer the likelihood of the customers achieving the specified targets and records the reduction of revenue as the sales are made for other trade promotions management relies on estimated utilization rates that have been developed from historical experience changes in the assumptions used in estimating the cost of any individual marketing program would not result in a material change in our financial position results of operations or operating cash flows 

employee benefit plans  as discussed in item 8 note 13 benefit plans to our consolidated financial statements we provide a range of benefits to our employees and retired employees including pensions postretirement health care and postemployment benefits primarily severance we record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by us gaap these calculations include various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates assumed rates of return on plan assets compensation increases mortality turnover rates and health care cost trend rates we review actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so as permitted by us gaap any effect of the modifications is generally amortized over future periods we believe that the assumptions utilized in calculating our obligations under these plans are reasonable based upon our historical experience and advice from our actuaries 

weightedaverage discount rate assumptions for pension and postretirement plan obligations at december 31 2019 and 2018 are as follows 



we anticipate that assumption changes will increase 2020 pretax pension and postretirement expense to approximately 256 million as compared with approximately 201 million in 2019 excluding amounts related to employee severance and early retirement programs the anticipated increase is primarily due to higher amortization of unrecognized actuarial gainslosses of 73 million coupled with higher service cost of 48 million partially offset by lower interest cost of 49 million and higher expected return on plan assets of 18 million and other movements of 1 million 

weightedaverage expected rate of return and discount rate assumptions have a significant effect on the amount of expense reported for the employee benefit plans a fiftybasispoint decrease in our discount rate would increase our 2020 pension and postretirement expense by approximately 65 million and a fiftybasispoint increase in our discount rate would decrease our 2020 pension and postretirement expense by approximately 58 million similarly a fiftybasispoint decrease increase in the expected return on plan assets would increase decrease our 2020 pension expense by approximately 36 million 

income taxes  income tax provisions for jurisdictions outside the united states as well as state and local income tax provisions are determined on a separate company basis and the related assets and liabilities are recorded in our consolidated balance sheets 

the extent of our operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions the final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal state and international tax audits in accordance with the authoritative guidance for income taxes we evaluate potential tax exposures and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment an additional charge to expense would result if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 

we are required to assess the likelihood of recovering deferred tax assets against future sources of taxable income if we determine using all available evidence that we do not reach the more likely than not threshold for recovery a valuation allowance is recorded significant judgment is required in determining the need for and amount of valuation allowances for deferred tax assets including estimates of future taxable income in the applicable jurisdictions and the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies as applicable 

the effective tax rates used for interim reporting are based on our fullyear geographic earnings mix projections changes in currency exchange rates or earnings mix by taxing jurisdiction could have an impact on the effective tax rates significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions 

for further details see item 8 note 11 income taxes to our consolidated financial statements 

hedging  as discussed below in “market risk” we use derivative financial instruments principally to reduce exposures to market risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates by creating offsetting exposures for derivatives to which we have elected to apply hedge accounting gains and losses on these derivatives are initially deferred in accumulated other comprehensive losses on the consolidated balance sheet and recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings into the same line item as the impact of the underlying transaction and in the periods when the related hedged transactions are also recognized in operating results if we had elected not to use the hedge accounting provisions gains losses deferred in stockholders’ deficit equity would have been recorded in our net earnings for these derivatives 

fair value of nonmarketable equity securities  for further details see item 8 note 22 deconsolidation of rbh 

contingencies  as discussed in item 8 note 18 contingencies to our consolidated financial statements legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened against us andor our subsidiaries andor our indemnitees in various jurisdictions we and our subsidiaries record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated the variability in pleadings in multiple jurisdictions together with the actual experience of management in litigating claims demonstrate that the monetary relief that may be specified in a lawsuit bears little relevance to the ultimate outcome much of the tobaccorelated litigation is in its early stages and litigation is subject to uncertainty at the present time except as stated otherwise in item 8 note 18 contingencies while it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur after assessing the information available to it i management has not concluded that it is probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending tobaccorelated cases ii management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss for any of the pending tobaccorelated cases and iii accordingly no estimated loss has been accrued in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes in these cases if any legal defense costs are expensed as incurred

from time to time pmi’s shipment volumes are subject to the impact of distributor inventory movements and estimated total industrymarket volumes are subject to the impact of inventory movements in various trade channels that include estimated trade inventory movements of pmi’s competitors arising from marketspecific factors that significantly distort reported volume disclosures such factors may include changes to the manufacturing supply chain shipment methods consumer demand timing of excise tax increases or other influences that may affect the timing of sales to customers in such instances in addition to reviewing pmi shipment volumes and certain estimated total industrymarket volumes on a reported basis management reviews these measures on an adjusted basis that excludes the impact of distributor andor estimated trade inventory movements management also believes that disclosing pmi shipment volumes and estimated total industrymarket volumes in such circumstances on a basis that excludes the impact of distributor andor estimated trade inventory movements improves the comparability of performance and trends for these measures over different reporting periods 

2019 compared with 2018 

the following discussion compares our consolidated operating results for the year ended december 31 2019  with the year ended december 31 2018  

estimated international industry cigarette and heated tobacco unit volume excluding china and the united states of 27 trillion  decreased by 20  due to the eu ee ssa eaa and lac as described in the regional sections below 

our total shipment volume decreased by 20  due to 

 partly offset by 

 

excluding the volume impact from the rbh deconsolidation of approximately 43 billion units reflecting the volume of rbhowned brands from march 22 2018 through december 31 2018 and including dutyfree sales of these brands in canada pmis total shipment volume decreased by 14  

impact of inventory movements 

excluding the volume impact from the deconsolidation of rbh and the net favorable impact of estimated distributor inventory movements of approximately 11 billion units our total inmarket sales declined by 15  due to a 37 decline of cigarettes partly offset by a 353 increase in heated tobacco units 

the net favorable impact of estimated distributor inventory movements of approximately 11 billion units reflected a 27 billion favorable impact from heated tobacco units driven primarily by japan mainly reflecting a favorable comparison with 2018 in which iqos consumable inventories were reduced partly offset by pmi duty free partially offset by a 16 billion unfavorable impact from cigarettes due primarily to japan north africa and thailand partly offset by the eu region and saudi arabia 

our cigarette shipment volume by brand and heated tobacco unit shipment volume was as follows 



1 includes shipments to altria group inc commencing in the third quarter of 2019 for sale in the united states under license 

note sampoerna a includes sampoerna  philip morris includes philip morrisdubliss  and lark includes lark harmony  

our cigarette shipment volume of the following brands decreased 

 

the increase in our heated tobacco unit shipment volume was mainly driven by the eu notably italy and poland eastern europe notably kazakhstan russia and ukraine and japan partly offset by korea and pmi duty free 

our cigarette shipment volume of the following brands increased 

 

2019 international share of market excluding china and the united states 

our total international market share excluding china and the united states defined as our cigarette and heated tobacco unit sales volume as a percentage of total industry cigarette and heated tobacco unit sales volume increased by 01 point to 284  reflecting 

 our total international cigarette market share defined as our cigarette sales volume as a percentage of total industry cigarette sales volume was down by 03 points to 269  mainly reflecting outswitching to heated tobacco units notably in the eu and japan and lower cigarette market share notably in argentina indonesia korea and turkey 

in 2019 we owned six of the worlds top 15 international cigarette brands with international cigarette market shares as follows marlboro  100  lm  35  chesterfield  22  philip morris  19  parliament  15  and bond street  11 

key market data 

key market data regarding total market size our shipments and market share were as follows 





1 costother variance includes the impact of the rbh deconsolidation 

2 unfavorable costother variance includes asset impairment and exit costs of 422 million in 2019 the russia excise and vat audit charge of 374 million in 2019 the 2019 loss on deconsolidation of rbh of 239 million  and the 2019 canadian tobacco litigationrelated expense of 194 million  as well as the impact of the rbh deconsolidation 

note net revenues include revenues from shipments of platform 1 devices heated tobacco units and accessories to altria group inc commencing in the third quarter of 2019 for sale under license in the united states 

net revenues excluding unfavorable currency increased by 38  mainly reflecting a favorable pricing variance notably in germany indonesia japan the philippines and turkey and favorable volumemix mainly driven by heated tobacco unit and iqos device volume in the eu and russia and heated tobacco unit volume in japan partly offset by unfavorable volumemix of cigarettes notably in australia the eu indonesia japan and russia unfavorable heated tobacco unit volume in pmi duty free and unfavorable iqos device volume in japan and korea the currencyneutral growth in net revenues of 38 came despite the unfavorable impact of 763 million  shown in costother predominantly resulting from the deconsolidation of rbh 

the unfavorable currency in net revenues was due primarily to the euro russian ruble and turkish lira 

net revenues include 56 billion in 2019 and 41 billion in 2018 related to the sale of rrps in 2019  approximately 07 billion of our 56 billion in rrp net revenues were from iqos devices 

operating income decreased by 74  excluding unfavorable currency  292 million  asset impairment and exit costs  422 million  in 2019 related to plant closures in argentina colombia germany and pakistan as part of global manufacturing infrastructure optimization the 2019 russia excise and vat audit charge  374 million  the 2019 loss on deconsolidation of rbh  239 million  and the 2019 canadian tobacco litigationrelated expense  194 million  operating income increased by 59  primarily reflecting a favorable pricing variance favorable volumemix mainly driven by heated tobacco units in the eu japan and russia partly offset by unfavorable volumemix of cigarettes notably in australia the eu indonesia japan and russia as well as unfavorable heated tobacco unit volume in pmi duty free and lower manufacturing costs partly offset by higher marketing administration and research costs reflecting increased investment behind reducedrisk products mainly in the eu and eastern europe and the net unfavorable impact resulting from the deconsolidation of rbh shown in costother 

interest expense net of 570 million decreased by 95 million  143  due primarily to our ongoing efforts to optimize our capital structure following the passage of the tax cuts and jobs act this included the decision to use existing cash to repay 25 billion and 40 billion of longterm debt that matured in 2018 and 2019 respectively 

our effective tax rate increased by 03 percentage points to 232  the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2019 was unfavorably impacted by changes in earnings mix by taxing jurisdiction and us state deferred income tax expense partially offset by the reversal of a deferred tax liability on the unremitted earnings of our canadian subsidiary rbh  49 million  a reduction in estimated us federal income tax on dividend repatriation for the years 20152018  67 million  and other repatriation cost differences we estimate that our 2020 effective tax rate will be approximately 23  excluding discrete tax events changes in currency exchange rates earnings mix by taxing jurisdiction or dividend repatriation costs may have an impact on the effective tax rates which we monitor each quarter significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions for further details see item 8 note 11 income taxes  

we are regularly examined by tax authorities around the world and we are currently under examination in a number of jurisdictions it is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months certain tax examinations will close which could result in a change in unrecognized tax benefits along with related interest and penalties an estimate of any possible change cannot be made at this time 

net earnings attributable to pmi of 72 billion decreased by 726 million or 92  this decrease was due primarily to lower operating income as discussed above partially offset by a lower interest expense net diluted and basic eps of 461 decreased by 93  excluding an unfavorable currency impact of 013  diluted eps decreased by 67  

2018 compared with 2017

operating results by business segment 

business environment 

taxes legislation regulation and other matters regarding the manufacture marketing sale and use of tobacco products 

the tobacco industry and our company face a number of challenges that may adversely affect our business volume results of operations cash flows and financial position these challenges which are discussed below and in “ cautionary factors that may affect future results ” include 

 

regulatory restrictions the tobacco industry operates in a highly regulated environment the wellknown risks of smoking have led regulators to impose significant restrictions and high excise taxes on cigarettes 

we support a comprehensive regulatory framework for tobacco products based on the principle of harm reduction including mandated health warnings minimum age laws restrictions on advertising and public place smoking restrictions we also support regulatory measures that help reduce illicit trade 

much of the regulation that shapes the business environment in which we operate is driven by the world health organizations “who” framework convention on tobacco control “fctc” which entered into force in 2005 the fctc has as its main objective to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation with the purpose of reducing tobacco use to date 180 countries and the european union are parties to the fctc the treaty requires parties to have in place various tobacco control measures and recommends others the fctc governing body the conference of the parties “cop” has also adopted nonbinding guidelines and policy recommendations related to certain articles of the fctc that go beyond the text of the treaty in october 2018 the cop recognized the need for more scientific assessment and improved reporting to define policy on heated tobacco products similar to its previous policy recommendations on ecigarettes the cop invited countries to regulate restrict or prohibit heated tobacco products as appropriate under their national laws 

in july 2019 the who issued the report on the global tobacco epidemic 2019 while citing insufficient independent studies regarding the benefits and the unknown longterm health impacts of electronic nicotine delivery systems and heated tobacco products the who has taken the position that such products are not riskfree and should be regulated in the same manner as cigarettes and in line with the fctc provisions 

it is not possible to predict whether or to what extent measures recommended by the who including the fctc guidelines will be implemented 

we agree that all tobacco and nicotinecontaining products including our rrps need to be regulated however we continue to seek to engage in a dialogue with regulators with respect to those measures that we do not believe would protect public health and if implemented could disrupt competition severely limit our ability to market and sell our products including our rrps to adult smokers or increase illicit trade we advocate for measures that would accelerate switching to better alternatives to continued smoking and embrace a regulatory framework that recognizes a risk continuum of tobacco and other nicotinecontaining products 

certain measures are discussed in more detail below and in the reducedrisk products rrps section 

fiscal challenges excessive and disruptive excise sales and other tax increases and discriminatory tax structures are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on our profitability due to lower consumption and consumer downtrading to nonpremium discount other lowprice or lowtaxed combustible tobacco products such as fine cut tobacco and illicit cigarettes in addition in certain jurisdictions some of our combustible products are subject to tax structures that discriminate against premiumprice products and manufactured cigarettes we believe that such tax policies undermine public health by encouraging consumers to turn to illicit trade and ultimately undercut government revenue objectives disrupt the competitive environment and encourage criminal activity other jurisdictions have imposed or are seeking to impose levies or other taxes specifically on tobacco companies such as taxes on revenues andor profits 

eu tobacco products directive in april 2014 the eu adopted a significantly revised eu tobacco products directive tpd which entered into force in may 2016 all member states have adopted laws transposing the tpd the tpd sets forth a comprehensive set of regulatory requirements for tobacco products including 

 

plain packaging and other packaging restrictions plain packaging legislation bans the use of branding logos and colors on packaging other than the brand name and variant that may be printed only in specified locations and in a uniform font to date plain packaging laws have been adopted in certain markets in all of our operating segments including the key markets of australia france saudi arabia and turkey and are in various degrees of implementation some countries such as canada new zealand and israel adopted plain packaging regulations that apply to all tobacco products including rrps other countries are also considering plain packaging legislation 

some countries have adopted or are considering adopting packaging restrictions that could have an impact similar to plain packaging examples of such restrictions include standardizing the shape and size of packages prohibiting certain colors or the use of certain descriptive phrases on packaging and requiring very large graphic health warnings that leave little space for branding 

restrictions and bans on the use of ingredients the who and others in the public health community have recommended restrictions or total bans on the use of some or all ingredients in tobacco products including menthol broad restrictions and ingredient bans would require us to reformulate our american blend tobacco products and could reduce our ability to differentiate these products in the market in the long term menthol bans would eliminate the entire category of mentholated tobacco products the european union has banned flavored tobacco products subject to an exemption until may 2020 for menthol other countries may follow the eu’s approach for instance turkey has banned menthol as of may 2020 broader ingredient bans have been adopted by canada and brazil in brazil an ingredient ban is currently on appeal by a tobacco industry union of which our brazilian subsidiary is a member it is not possible to predict the outcome of these legal proceedings 

  

bans on display of tobacco products at retail in a number of our markets including but not limited to australia and russia governments have banned the display of tobacco products at the point of sale other countries are considering similar bans 

bans and restrictions on advertising marketing promotions and sponsorships for many years the fctc has called for and countries have imposed partial or total bans on tobacco advertising marketing promotions and sponsorships including bans and restrictions on advertising on radio and television in print and on the internet the fctcs nonbinding guidelines recommend that governments prohibit all forms of communication with adult smokers 

restrictions on product design some members of the public health community are calling for the further standardization of tobacco products by requiring for example that cigarettes have a certain minimum diameter which would amount to a ban on slim cigarettes or requiring the use of standardized filter and cigarette paper designs in addition at its meeting in november 2016 the cop adopted nonbinding guidelines recommending that countries regulate product design features that increase the attractiveness of tobacco products such as the diameter of cigarettes and the use of flavor capsules 

restrictions on public smoking the pace and scope of public smoking restrictions have increased significantly in most of our markets many countries around the world have adopted or are likely to adopt regulations that restrict or ban smoking in public andor work places restaurants bars and nightclubs some public health groups have called for and some countries regional governments and municipalities have adopted or proposed bans on smoking in outdoor places as well as bans on smoking in cars typically when minors are present and private homes 

other regulatory issues some regulators are considering or in some cases have adopted regulatory measures designed to reduce the supply of tobacco products these include regulations intended to reduce the number of retailers selling tobacco products by for example reducing the overall number of tobacco retail licenses available or banning the sale of tobacco products within specified distances of certain public facilities 

in a limited number of markets most notably japan we are dependent on governmental approvals that may limit our pricing flexibility 

the eu singleuse plastics directive which will require tobacco manufacturers and importers to cover the costs of public collection systems for tobacco product filters entered into force on july 2 2019 after which member states will have two years to transpose it into national law while we cannot predict the impact of this initiative on our business at this time we are monitoring developments in this area 

illicit trade illicit tobacco trade creates a cheap and unregulated supply of tobacco products undermines efforts to reduce smoking prevalence especially among youth damages legitimate businesses stimulates organized crime increases corruption and reduces government tax revenue excluding china and the us illicit trade may account for as much as 10 of global cigarette consumption this includes counterfeit contraband and the growing problem of “illicit whites” which are cigarettes legally produced in one jurisdiction for the sole purpose of being exported and illegally sold in another jurisdiction where they have no legitimate market we estimate that illicit trade in the european union accounted for approximately 10 of total cigarette consumption in 2019 

a number of jurisdictions are considering actions to prevent illicit trade in november 2012 the fctc adopted the protocol to eliminate illicit trade in tobacco products the “protocol” which includes supply chain control measures such as licensing of manufacturers and distributors enforcement in free trade zones controls on duty free and internet sales and the implementation of tracking and tracing technologies to date 58 parties including the european union have ratified it the protocol came into force in september 2018 parties must now start implementing its measures via national legislation in october 2018 the first meeting of the parties to the protocol decided to produce a comprehensive report on good practices for the implementation of tracking and tracing systems and to prepare a conceptual framework for global information sharing to combat illicit tobacco trade we welcome this decision and expect that other parties will ratify the protocol 

we devote substantial resources to help prevent illicit trade in combustible tobacco products and rrps for example we engage with governments our business partners and other stakeholders to implement effective measures to combat illicit trade and in some instances pursue legal remedies to protect our intellectual property rights 

the tracking and tracing regulations for cigarettes and rollyourown products manufactured or destined for the eu became effective on may 20 2019 the effective date for other tobaccocontaining products including some of our rrps such as heated tobacco units is may 20 2024 while we expect that this regulation will increase our operating expenses we do not expect this increase to be significant 

in 2009 our colombian subsidiaries entered into an investment and cooperation agreement with the national and regional governments of colombia to promote investment in and cooperation on anticontraband and anticounterfeit efforts the agreement provides 200 

million in funding over a 20year period to address issues such as combating illegal cigarette trade and increasing the quality and quantity of locallygrown tobacco 

in may 2016 pmi launched pmi impact a global initiative that supports thirdparty projects dedicated to fighting illegal trade and related crimes such as corruption organized criminal networks and money laundering the centerpiece of pmi impact is a council of external independent experts in the fields of law anticorruption and law enforcement the experts are responsible for evaluating and approving funding proposals for pmi impact grants pmi has pledged 100 million to fund projects within pmi impact over three funding rounds 

reducedrisk products rrps   

our approach to rrps we recognize that smoking cigarettes causes serious diseases and that the best way to avoid the harms of smoking is never to start or to quit nevertheless it is predicted that over the next decade the number of smokers will remain largely unchanged from the current estimate of 11 billion despite the considerable efforts to discourage smoking 

cigarettes burn tobacco which produces smoke as a result of the combustion process the smoker inhales various toxic substances in contrast rrps do not burn tobacco and produce an aerosol that contains significantly lower levels of harmful and potentially harmful constituents hphcs than found in cigarette smoke 

for smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke we believe that rrps while not riskfree offer a much better consumer choice accordingly our key strategic priorities are to develop and commercialize products that present less risk of harm to adult smokers who switch to those products versus continued smoking and to convince current adult smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke to switch to those products 

we recognize that this transformation from cigarettes to rrps will take time and that the speed of transformation will depend in part upon factors beyond our control such as the willingness of governments regulators and other policy groups to embrace rrps as a desired alternative to continued cigarette smoking we also recognize that our part in this transformation must be funded from our existing cigarette business for as long as a significant number of adult smokers continues to smoke it is critical that the industry be led by responsible and ethical manufacturers therefore during the transformation we intend to remain a leading international cigarette manufacturer 

we have a range of rrps in various stages of development scientific assessment and commercialization we conduct rigorous scientific assessments of our rrp platforms to substantiate that they reduce exposure to hphcs and ultimately that these products present are likely to present or have the potential to present less risk of harm to adult smokers who switch to them versus continued smoking we draw upon a team of expert scientists and engineers from a broad spectrum of scientific disciplines and our extensive learnings of adult consumer preferences to develop and assess our rrps our efforts are guided by the following key objectives 

 

our rrp platforms our product development is based on the elimination of combustion via tobacco heating and other innovative systems for aerosol generation which we believe is the most promising path to providing a better consumer choice for those who would otherwise continue to smoke we recognize that no single product will appeal to all adult smokers therefore we are developing a portfolio of products intended to appeal to a variety of distinct adult consumer preferences 

four rrp platforms are in various stages of development and commercialization readiness 

platform 1 uses a precisely controlled heating device incorporating our iqos heatcontrol technology into which a specially designed and proprietary tobacco unit is inserted and heated to generate an aerosol we have conducted a series of clinical studies for this platform the results of which were included in our submission to the us food and drug administration “fda” described below 

the results of the first sixmonth term of the 66 month exposure response study were received at the end of 2017 and the related report was completed and submitted to the fda in the second quarter of 2018 the study showed that all eight of the coprimary clinical risk endpoints moved in the same direction in the group that switched to our platform 1 product as observed for smoking cessation with statistically significant changes in five of the eight endpoints compared with ongoing smoking the results of the second sixmonth term of the 66 month exposure response study were received for analysis in the second quarter of 2018 we are analyzing the results and expect to finalize the report later this year in addition as set out in our submission to the fda referenced above we completed an 18month combined chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity study in mice which was ongoing at the time of our fda submission we shared the results with the fda in august 2018 

platform 2 uses a pressed carbon heat source which when ignited generates a nicotinecontaining aerosol by heating tobacco the results of our pharmacokinetic study that measured the nicotine pharmacokinetic profile as well as subjective effects and of our fiveday reduced exposure study indicate that this platform could be an acceptable substitute for adult smokers who seek an alternative to cigarettes the reduced exposure study results showed a substantial reduction in relevant biomarkers of exposure to the measured hphcs in those who switched to platform 2 compared to those who continued to smoke cigarettes over a fiveday period the sustainability of this reduction as well as changes in clinical risk markers were assessed in a threemonth reduced exposure study the results of this study were received at the end of 2017 and the related report was finalized in the second quarter of 2018 

platform 3 provides an aerosol of nicotine salt we have explored two routes for this platform one with electronics and one without and conducted nicotine pharmacokinetic studies with both versions the results of the pharmacokinetic study related to the version without electronics were received and the related report was finalized in the fourth quarter of 2018 the results indicate this products potential as an acceptable alternative to continued cigarette smoking in terms of product satisfaction we are conducting a product use and adaptation study in adult smokers and expect the results in 2020 

platform 4 covers evapor products which are batterypowered devices that produce an aerosol by vaporizing a nicotinecontaining liquid solution our evapor products comprise devices using current generation technology and our new evapor mesh technology that addresses certain challenges presented by some evapor products currently on the market our iqos mesh products are designed to ensure the consistency and quality of the generated aerosol we conducted a nicotine pharmacokinetic study in 2017 the results of this study were received in the second quarter of 2018 for analysis and the related report was finalized in the fourth quarter of 2018 the results of this study indicate that iqos mesh products are an effective means of nicotine delivery while being a satisfying alternative for ecigarette users in march 2019 a sixmonth preclinical study in mice evaluating the impact of ecigarette vapor on the risks of pulmonary and cardiovascular disease compared to cigarette smoke was completed this study did not pertain to a specific product the study demonstrated that ecigarette vapors induce significantly lower biological responses associated with cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases compared with cigarette smoke we will also initiate a clinical study to measure selected biomarkers of exposure to hphcs and assess changes in clinical risk markers 

after we receive the results of our scientific studies mentioned above in accordance with standard scientific practices we intend to share the conclusions in scientific forums and to submit them for inclusion in peerreviewed publications 

the research and development expense for our rrp portfolio accounted for 98 92 and 74 of our total research and development expense for the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively the research and development expense for the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 is set forth in item 8 note 14 additional information to the consolidated financial statements 

commercialization of rrps we are building a new product category and tailor our commercialization strategy to the characteristics of each specific market we focus our commercialization efforts on consumer retail experience guided consumer trials and customer care as well as digital communication programs in order to accelerate switching to our platform 1 product our initial market introductions typically entail oneonone consumer engagement and introductory device discounts these initial commercialization efforts require substantial investment which we believe will moderate over time 

in 2014 we introduced our platform 1 product in pilot city launches in nagoya japan and in milan italy since then we have continuously expanded our commercialization activities and the product is currently available for sale in 52 markets in key cities or nationwide 

  

we estimate that only a very small percentage of adult smokers who convert to our platform 1 product switch back to cigarettes 

we have integrated the production of our heated tobacco units into a number of our existing manufacturing facilities are progressing with our plans to build manufacturing capacity for our other rrp platforms and continue to optimize our manufacturing infrastructure 

an adequate supply chain for our rrp portfolio including the supply of electronic devices is important to our business we work with two electronics manufacturing service providers for the supply of our platform 1 and iqos mesh devices and a small number of other 

providers for other products in our rrp portfolio and related accessories although we work closely with these service providers on monitoring their production capability and financial health the commercialization of our rrps could be adversely affected if they are unable to meet their commitments the production of our rrp portfolio requires various metals and we believe that there is an adequate supply of such metals in the world markets to satisfy our current and anticipated production requirements however some components and materials necessary for the production of our rrps including those for the electronic devices are obtained from single or limited sources and can be subject to industrywide shortages and price fluctuations our inability to secure an adequate supply of such components and materials could negatively impact the commercialization of our rrps 

our platform 1 and iqos mesh devices are subject to standard product warranties generally for a period of 12 months from the date of purchase or such other periods as required by law we discuss product warranties in more detail in item 8 note 5 product warranty  the significance of warranty claims is dependent on a number of factors including device version mix product failure rates logistics and service delivery costs and warranty policies and may increase with the number of devices sold 

product quality may affect consumer acceptance of our rrps 

our commercialization efforts for the other rrp platforms are as follows 

 

 

 

rrp regulation and taxation rrps contain nicotine and are not riskfree we therefore support sciencebased regulation and taxation of rrps regulation and taxation should differentiate between cigarettes and products that present are likely to present or have the potential to present less risk of harm to adult smokers who switch to these products versus continued smoking and should recognize a continuum of risk for tobacco and other nicotinecontaining products regulation should provide minimum standards for all rrp categories and specific rules for product assessment methodologies ingredients labeling and consumer communication and should ensure that the public is informed about the health risks of all combustible and noncombustible tobacco and nicotinecontaining products regulation as well as industry practices should reflect the fact that youth should not consume nicotine in any form 

some governments have banned or are seeking to ban or severely restrict emerging tobacco and nicotinecontaining products such as our rrps and communication of truthful and nonmisleading information about such products these regulations might foreclose or unreasonably restrict adult consumer access even to products that might be shown to be a better consumer choice than continuing to smoke we oppose such blanket bans and unreasonable restrictions of products that have the potential to present less risk of harm compared to continued smoking by contrast we support regulation that sets clear standards for all rrp categories and propels innovation to benefit adult smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke 

in the united states an established regulatory framework for assessing “modified risk tobacco products” and “new tobacco products” exists under the jurisdiction of the fda we submitted to the fda a modified risk tobacco product application “mrtpa” for our platform 1 product in december 2016 and a premarket tobacco product application “pmta” for our platform 1 product in march 2017 

on april 30 2019 the fda determined that a version of our platform 1 product is appropriate for the protection of public health and authorized it for sale in the united states the fda’s decision followed its comprehensive assessment of our pmta 

the fda’s marketing order does not mean that the agency “approved” our platform 1 product the authorization is subject to strict marketing reporting and other requirements and is not a guarantee that the product will remain authorized particularly if there is a significant uptake in youth initiation the fda will monitor the marketing of the product 

we plan to file a pmta application for the iqos 3 device in the coming months 

in may 2017 the fda formally accepted and filed our mrtpa for substantive scientific review and in june 2017 the fda opened the period for the public to provide comments on our application the fda closed the public comment period on february 11 2019 in late 2019 we provided a response to the fdas request for clarification regarding our mice study described above following our response the fda reopened a public comment period ending february 24 2020 

the fda referred our mrtpa to the tobacco product scientific advisory committee “tpsac” tpsac held a meeting on january 24 and january 25 2018 to discuss our mrtpa the recommendations and votes of tpsac are not binding on the fda by regulation the fda’s decision on our mrtpa will take into account in addition to the views of tpsac scientific evidence as well as comments data and information submitted by interested persons 

the fda review of our mrtpa is ongoing 

separately in july 2017 the fda issued a policy announcement aiming to explore the potential of nicotine reduction in cigarettes in conjunction with the availability of less harmful products that deliver nicotine for adults who choose to use such products in july 2018 as part of a public consultation procedure we submitted our views on this topic to the fda it is not possible to predict the regulatory measures that may be recommended by the fda as a result of this policy 

in the us tobacco and nicotinecontaining products that were not commercially marketed as of february 15 2007 are subject to review and authorization by the fda following a rise in the use of evapor products among minors in the us and an outbreak of lung injuries alleged to be associated with the use of certain evapor products in many states on january 2 2020 the fda announced an enforcement policy against the sale of evapor products sold without fda authorization prioritizing enforcement against the sale of cartridgebased evapor products with flavors other than tobacco and menthol and sale of any nicotinecontaining products to minors and where the manufacturer fails to take adequate measures to prevent access by minors 

while we do not sell evapor products in the us and therefore are not subject to these actions we continue to support regulation and industry practices that reflect the fact that youth should not consume nicotine in any form 

future fda actions may influence the regulatory approach of other governments 

until recently there were no countries with specific product standards for heatnotburn products effective july 2017 and march 2018 respectively russia and ukraine adopted standards that set minimum quality and safety requirements for the consumables and defined methods for demonstrating the absence of combustion and the product standards in kazakhstan that came into force in march 2019 also cover devices in the uae a product standard on minimum quality and safety of electronic nicotinecontaining products including heatnotburn products was approved in march 2019 effective december 2019 jordan adopted a national standard for heatnotburn products both devices and consumables and defined a method for demonstrating the absence of combustion in these products we expect and encourage other governments to consider similar product standards going forward 

in the eu all eu member states have transposed the eu tobacco products directive including the provisions on novel tobacco products such as heated tobacco units and ecigarettes most of the eu member states require a notification submitted six months before the intended placing on the market of a novel tobacco product while some require premarket authorizations for the introduction of such products to date we have filed a comprehensive dossier summarizing our scientific assessment of our platform 1 product in over 20 member states 

in addition in italy in april 2018 we submitted under recent legislation an application for heets  used with the iqos device requesting regulatory recognition of the reduction of toxic substances and potential risk reduction resulting from switching to this product compared to continued cigarette smoking in january 2019 our application was not granted primarily on the grounds of insufficient data and questions of methodology due to the constraints of the review process we had been unable to supplement the application with all the data we subsequently filed with the fda and to address methodological questions during the review we plan to submit a new application where we will clarify the concerns raised by the decision and further strengthen our application by submitting additional evidence that became available since we submitted our first application consistent with our fda filing we are confident that our evidence supports our application 

to date several governmental agencies have published their scientific findings that analyze the harmreduction potential of certain rrps versus continuing smoking including 

in december 2017 at the request of the uk department of health and public health england the uk committee on toxicity published its assessment of the risk of heatnotburn products relative to cigarette smoking this assessment included analysis of scientific data for two heatnotburn products one of which was our platform 1 product the assessment concluded that while still harmful to health 

compared with the known risks from cigarettes heatnotburn products are probably less harmful subsequently in february 2018 public health england published a report stating that the available evidence suggests that heatnotburn products may be considerably less harmful than cigarettes and more harmful than ecigarettes 

in may 2018 the german federal institute for risk assessment “bfr” published a study on the platform 1 aerosol relative to cigarette smoke using the health canada intense smoking regimen bfr found reductions in selected hphcs in a range of 8099 this publication indicates that significant reductions in the levels of selected toxicants are likely to reduce toxicant exposure which bfr stated might be regarded as a discrete benefit compared to combustible cigarettes 

in may 2018 the dutch national institute for public health and environment “rivm” published a factsheet on novel tobacco products that heat rather than burn tobacco focusing on our platform 1 product rivm analyzed the aerosol generated by our platform 1 product and concluded that the use of this product while still harmful to health is probably less harmful than continued smoking 

in june 2018 the korean food and drug administration “kfda” issued a statement on products that heat rather than burn tobacco the kfda tested three heatnotburn products one of which was our platform 1 product the kfda confirmed that the levels of the nine hphcs tested in the aerosol of these products were on average approximately 90 lower compared to those measured in the cigarette smoke of the top five cigarette brands in south korea however the kfda stated that it could not establish that the tested heatnotburn products are less harmful than cigarettes in october 2018 our korean affiliate filed a request with a local court seeking information underlying kfda’s analysis conclusions and public statements 

in august 2018 the science  technology committee of the uk house of commons published a report of its inquiry into ecigarettes and heatnotburn products the report concluded that ecigarettes are significantly less harmful to health than smoking tobacco the report also observed that for those smokers who don’t accept ecigarettes heatnotburn products may offer a public health benefit despite their relative risk the report called for a riskproportionate regulatory environment for both ecigarettes and heatnotburn products and noted that ecigarettes should remain the least taxed cigarettes the most taxed with heatnotburn products falling between the two the uk committee on advertising practice announced the removal of a prohibition of health claims in the advertising of ecigarettes in the uk effective november 2018 with a review of the impact of this decision on market practices 12 months thereafter 

in november 2018 the eurasian economic commission regulatory body of the eurasian union consisting of armenia belarus kazakhstan kyrgyzstan and russia published the results of its commissioned study on novel nicotinecontaining products including our platform 1 product the study confirms significantly lower levels of hphcs in the aerosol generated by this product compared to cigarette smoke 

in january 2019 scientific media published the results of the study of the china national tobacco quality supervision and test centre “cntqst” comparing the aerosol generated by our platform 1 product with cigarette smoke the cntqst found that the former contained fewer and lower levels of harmful constituents than the latter and concluded that the lower temperature of heating tobacco in our platform 1 product contributed to the difference the cntqst stated that the reduction in emissions of harmful constituents cannot be interpreted as equivalent to a proportionate harmrisk reduction for smokers 

we make our scientific findings publicly available for scrutiny and peer review through several channels including our websites from time to time adult consumers competitors members of the scientific community and others inquire into our scientific methodologies challenge our scientific conclusions or request further study of certain aspects of our rrps and their health effects we are committed to a robust and open scientific debate but believe that such debate should be based on accurate and reliable scientific information we seek to provide accurate and reliable scientific information about our rrps nonetheless we may not be able to prevent thirdparty dissemination of false misleading or unsubstantiated information about these products the dissemination of scientifically unsubstantiated information or studies with a strong confirmation bias by third parties may cause confusion among adult smokers and affect their decision to switch to better alternatives to continued smoking such as our rrps 

to date we have been largely successful in demonstrating to regulators that our heated tobacco units are not cigarettes due to the absence of combustion and as such they are generally taxed either as a separate category or as other tobacco products which typically yields more favorable tax rates than cigarettes although we believe that this is sensible from the public health perspective we cannot guarantee that regulators will continue this approach 

there can be no assurance that we will succeed in our efforts to replace cigarettes with rrps or that regulation will allow us to commercialize rrps in all markets to communicate about our rrps including making scientifically substantiated riskreduction claims or to treat rrps differently from cigarettes 

legal challenges to rrps we face various administrative and legal challenges related to certain rrp activities including allegations concerning product classification advertising restrictions corporate communications product coach activities scientific substantiation product liability and unfair competition while we design our programs to comply with relevant regulations we expect these or similar challenges to continue as we expand our efforts to commercialize rrps and to communicate publicly the outcomes of these matters may affect our rrp commercialization and public communication activities and performance in one or more countries 

our rrp business development initiatives in december 2013 we established a strategic framework with altria group inc “altria” setting out terms on how the parties would collaborate to develop and commercialize evapor products and commercialize two of our rrps in the us in late 2018 altria announced that it will participate in the evapor category only through another evapor company in which altria acquired a minority interest regarding heatnotburn products as discussed above the fda has authorized a version of our platform 1 product for sale in the us and we are seeking authorization for our mrtp submission these efforts are not affected by altrias evapor announcement in september 2019 altrias subsidiary philip morris usa inc began commercialization of a version of our platform 1 product in the us 

in january 2020 we announced an agreement with ktg a leading tobacco and nicotine company in south korea for the commercialization of ktg’s smokefree products outside of south korea on an exclusive basis for more information see acquisitions and other business arrangements below 

other developments in september 2017 we announced our support of the foundation for a smokefree world we agreed to contribute 80 million per year over the next 12 years as specified in the agreement we made an initial contribution of 45 million in 2017 the first annual contribution of 80 million in the first quarter of 2018 and the second annual contribution of 80 million in the first quarter of 2019 the foundation is an independent body and is governed by its independent board of directors the foundation’s role as set out in its corporate charter includes funding research in the field of tobacco harm reduction encouraging measures that reduce the harm caused by smoking and assessing the effect of reduced cigarette consumption on the industry value chain 

governmental investigations 

from time to time we are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters including tax customs antitrust advertising and labor practices we describe certain matters pending in thailand russia and south korea in item 8 note 18 contingencies  

in november 2010 a wto panel issued its decision in a dispute relating to facts that arose from august 2006 between the philippines and thailand concerning a series of thai customs and tax measures affecting cigarettes imported by pm thailand into thailand see item 8 note 18 contingencies for additional information the wto panel decision which was upheld by the wto appellate body concluded that thailand had no basis to find that pm thailands declared customs values and taxes paid were too low as alleged by the dsi in 2009 the decision also created obligations for thailand to revise its laws regulations or practices affecting the customs valuation and tax treatment of future cigarette imports thailand agreed in september 2011 to fully comply with the decision by october 2012 the philippines asserts that to date thailand has not fully complied with the wto panel decision the philippines has repeatedly expressed concerns with ongoing investigations by thailand of pm thailand including those that led to the criminal charges described in item 8 note 18 contingencies  and has commenced two formal proceedings at the wto to challenge criminal charges against pm thailand arguing that the criminal charges appear to be based on grounds not supported by wto customs valuation rules and inconsistent with several decisions already taken by thai customs and other thai governmental agencies on november 12 2018 and july 12 2019 the wto issued its decisions agreeing with the philippines that the criminal charges against pm thailand and its former and current employees in connection with import entries of cigarettes from the philippines and indonesia respectively described in item 8 note 18 contingencies  are inconsistent with wto customs valuation rules in january 2019 and september 2019 thailand appealed the wtos decision related to the criminal charges in connection with import entries of cigarettes from the philippines and indonesia respectively it is not possible to predict any future developments in these proceedings while the wto appellate body is not operational 

us gaap treatment of argentina as a highly inflationary economy 

following the categorization of argentina by the international practices task force of the center for audit quality as a country with a threeyear cumulative inflation rate greater than 100 the country is considered highly inflationary in accordance with us gaap consequently we began to account for the operations of our argentinian affiliates as highly inflationary and to treat the us dollar as the functional currency of the affiliates effective july 1 2018 

asset impairment and exit costs 

we discuss asset impairment and exit costs in item 8 note 21 asset impairment and exit costs to our consolidated financial statements 

as part of our transformation to a smokefree future we also seek to optimize our organizational design in january 2020 we commenced the first phase of a twophase restructuring project in switzerland this phase may impact approximately 265 existing positions that will be eliminated or relocated and we initiated consultation procedures for the impacted employees as required under the law the second phase of this restructuring project is expected to commence in the second quarter of 2020 

acquisitions and other business arrangements 

we discuss our acquisitions in item 8 note 6 acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements 

on august 27 2019 we announced that we were in discussions with altria group inc regarding a potential allstock no premium merger of equals and on september 25 2019 we announced that the merger discussions had ended and that both companies agreed to focus on launching our platform 1 product in the united states 

global collaboration agreement with ktg 

in january 2020 pmi announced a global collaboration agreement with the leading tobacco and nicotine company in south korea ktg to commercialize ktg’s smokefree products outside of the country the agreement will run for an initial period of three years the two companies plan for global collaboration with the intention to actively expand to cover many markets based on commercial success the agreement allows pmi to distribute current ktg smokefree products and their evolutions on an exclusive basis and does not restrict pmi from distributing its own or thirdparty products ktg’s smokefree product brand portfolio includes heatnotburn tobacco products eg lil mini and lil plus  hybrid technologies that combine heatnotburn tobacco and evapor technologies eg lil hybrid  and evapor products eg lil vapor  pmi will be responsible for the commercialization of smokefree products supplied under the agreement 

products sold under the agreement will be subject to careful assessment to ensure they meet the regulatory requirements in the markets where they are launched as well as our standards of quality and scientific substantiation of their harm reduction potential pmi and ktg will seek any necessary regulatory approvals that may be required on a marketbymarket basis there are no current plans to commercialize ktg products in the united states 

investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries and equity securities 

we discuss our investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries and equity securities in item 8 note 4 related parties  investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries equity securities and other and item 8 note 16 fair value measurements to our consolidated financial statements 

trade policy 

we are subject to various trade restrictions imposed by the united states of america and countries in which we do business “trade sanctions” including the trade and economic sanctions administered by the us department of the treasurys office of foreign assets control and the us department of state it is our policy to comply fully with these trade sanctions 

tobacco products are agricultural products under us law and are not technological or strategic in nature from time to time we make sales in countries subject to trade sanctions either where such sanctions do not apply to our business or pursuant to exemptions or licenses 

a subsidiary sells products to distributors that in turn sell those products to duty free customers that supply un peacekeeping forces around the world including those in the un peacekeeping mission located in abyei a special administrative territory in sudan we do not believe that these sales which are not subject to trade sanctions and are de minimis in volume and value present a material risk to our shareholders our reputation or the value of our shares we have no employees operations or assets in the sudan 

to our knowledge none of our commercial arrangements results in the governments of any country identified by the us government 

as a state sponsor of terrorism nor entities controlled by those governments receiving cash or acting as intermediaries in violation of us laws 

we do not sell products in iran north korea and syria from time to time we explore opportunities to sell our products in one or more of these countries as permitted by law 

certain states within the us have enacted legislation permitting or requiring state pension funds to divest or abstain from future investment in stocks of companies that do business with certain countries that are sanctioned by the us we do not believe such legislation has had a material effect on the price of our shares

2018 compared with 2017 

for a discussion comparing our consolidated operating results within each of our operating segments for the year ended december 31 2018 with the year ended december 31 2017 refer to part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  operating results by business segment in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2018 which was filed with the us securities and exchange commission on february 7 2019 

financial review 



2019 compared with 2018 

 

net cash provided by operating activities of 101 billion for the year ended december 31 2019  increased by 06 billion from the comparable 2018 period excluding unfavorable currency movements of 10 billion  net cash provided by operating activities increased by 16 billion  due to lower working capital requirements of 13 billion and other movements of 03 billion the unfavorable currency movements represented the impacts on net earnings coupled with the currency impacts on subsidiary working capital movements and the related intercompany positions from the fluctuations of the us dollar in 2018 and 2019 especially against the euro mexican peso russian ruble and turkish lira 

the lower working capital requirements were primarily due to higher cash provided by accrued liabilities and other current assets related to the timing of excise taxpaid inventory movements and excise tax payments and higher cash provided by accounts payable reflecting a combination of extended payment terms from vendors in 2019 and higher 2018 payments for iqos device purchases in the fourth quarter of 2017 partially offset by more cash used for accounts receivable primarily due to the timing of cash collections 

the other movements of 03 billion excluding currency was driven by the net impact of the net earnings decline of 04 billion adjusted for the addback of the noncash items of 07 billion comprised of 03 billion related to the 2019 canadian tobacco litigationrelated expense and the 2019 loss on deconsolidation of rbh and 04 billion related to the 2019 asset impairment and exit costs while the asset impairment and exit costs were largely noncash charges in 2019 approximately 02 billion of employee separation costs will be paid by the end of 2021  see item 8 note 21 asset impairment and exit costs for additional information 

 

net cash used in investing activities of 18 billion for the year ended december 31 2019  increased by 08 billion from the comparable 2018 period this increase in net cash used in investing activities was due principally to the reduction of cash resulting from the deconsolidation of rbh partly offset by lower capital expenditures for further details on deconsolidation of rbh see item 8 note 22 deconsolidation of rbh  

our capital expenditures were 09 billion in 2019 and 14 billion in 2018  the 2019 expenditures were primarily related to our ongoing investments in rrps we expect total capital expenditures in 2020 of approximately 10 billion including capital expenditures related to our ongoing investment in rrps to be funded by operating cash flows 

 

net cash used in financing activities of 81 billion for the year ended december 31 2019  decreased by 16 billion from the comparable 2018 period the decrease in net cash used in financing activities was due primarily to 2019 proceeds from longterm debt issuances 38 billion proceeds from our us dollar and euro debt issuances in 2019  and the purchase of the remaining 49 interest in our costa rican affiliates in 2018 partially offset by higher longterm debt repayments and higher repayments of shortterm borrowing for further details on the purchase of the remaining 49 interest in our costa rican affiliates see item 8 note 6 acquisitions  

dividends paid in 2019 and 2018 were 72 billion and 69 billion  respectively 

2018 compared with 2017 

for a discussion comparing our net cash activities operating investing and financing for the year ended december 31 2018 with the year ended december 31 2017 refer to part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  financial review in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2018 which was filed with the us securities and exchange commission on february 7 2019 

Ÿ debt and liquidity 

we define cash and cash equivalents as shortterm highly liquid investments readily convertible to known amounts of cash that mature within a maximum of three months and have an insignificant risk of change in value due to interest rate or credit risk changes as a policy we do not hold any investments in structured or equitylinked products our cash and cash equivalents are predominantly held in demand deposits with institutions that have investmentgrade longterm credit rating as part of our cash management strategy and in order to 

manage counterparty exposure we also enter into reverse repurchase agreements such agreements are collateralized with government or corporate securities held by a custodial bank and at maturity cash is paid back to pmi and the collateral is returned to the bank for 2018 we had an average balance of 03 billion and we had a zero balance at december 31 2018 for 2019 the activity for such reverse repurchase agreements was not material 

we utilize longterm and shortterm debt financing including a commercial paper program that is regularly used to finance ongoing liquidity requirements as part of our overall cash management strategy our ability to access the capital and credit markets as well as overall dynamics of these markets may impact borrowing costs we expect that the combination of our longterm and shortterm debt financing the commercial paper program and the committed credit facilities coupled with our operating cash flows will enable us to meet our liquidity requirements 

credit ratings – the cost and terms of our financing arrangements as well as our access to commercial paper markets may be affected by applicable credit ratings at february 6 2020 our credit ratings and outlook by major credit rating agencies were as follows 



credit facilities – on january 31 2020 we entered into an agreement to amend and extend the term of our 20 billion 364day revolving credit facility from february 4 2020 to february 2 2021 

  

at february 6 2020 our committed credit facilities were as follows 



at february 6 2020 there were no borrowings under the committed credit facilities and the entire committed amounts were available for borrowing 

all banks participating in our committed credit facilities have an investmentgrade longterm credit rating from the credit rating agencies we continuously monitor the credit quality of our banking group and at this time we are not aware of any potential nonperforming credit provider 

all but the 20 billion 364day revolving credit facility in the table above require us to maintain a ratio of consolidated earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “consolidated ebitda” to consolidated interest expense of not less than 35 to 10 on a rolling fourquarter basis at december 31 2019  our ratio calculated in accordance with the agreements was 112 to 10 these facilities do not include any credit rating triggers material adverse change clauses or any provisions that could require us to post collateral we expect to continue to meet our covenants the terms “consolidated ebitda” and “consolidated interest expense” both of which include certain adjustments are defined in the facility agreements previously filed with the us securities and exchange commission 

we plan to replace our existing 25 billion multiyear revolving credit facility expiring february 28 2021 with a new 20 billion revolving credit facility expiring february 10 2025 the new credit facility which is expected to close on february 10 2020 will not include the consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense ratio covenant discussed above 

in addition to the committed credit facilities discussed above certain of our subsidiaries maintain shortterm credit arrangements to meet their respective working capital needs these credit arrangements which amounted to approximately 27 billion at december 31 2019  

and 33 billion at december 31 2018  are for the sole use of our subsidiaries borrowings under these arrangements amounted to 338 million at december 31 2019  and 730 million at december 31 2018  

commercial paper program – we continue to have access to liquidity in the commercial paper market through programs in place in the us and in europe having an aggregate issuance capacity of 80 billion at december 31 2019  and december 31 2018  we had no commercial paper outstanding the average commercial paper balance outstanding during 2019 and 2018 was 23 billion and 34 billion  respectively 

sale of accounts receivable – to mitigate credit risk and enhance cash and liquidity management we sell trade receivables to unaffiliated financial institutions these arrangements allow us to sell on an ongoing basis certain trade receivables without recourse the trade receivables sold are generally shortterm in nature and are removed from the consolidated balance sheets we sell trade receivables under two types of arrangements servicing and nonservicing 

our operating cash flows were positively impacted by the amount of the trade receivables sold and derecognized from the consolidated balance sheets which remained outstanding with the unaffiliated financial institutions the trade receivables sold that remained outstanding under these arrangements as of december 31 2019  2018 and 2017  were 09 billion  10 billion and 11 billion  respectively the net proceeds received are included in cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 

for further details see item 8 note 20 sale of accounts receivable to our consolidated financial statements 

debt – our total debt was 310 billion at december 31 2019  and 318 billion at december 31 2018  our total debt is primarily fixed rate in nature for further details see item 8 note 7 indebtedness  the weightedaverage allin financing cost of our total debt was 25 in 2019 and 2018  see item 8 note 16 fair value measurements to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our disclosures related to the fair value of debt the amount of debt that we can issue is subject to approval by our board of directors 

on february 14 2017 we filed a shelf registration statement with the us securities and exchange commission under which we may from time to time sell debt securities andor warrants to purchase debt securities over a threeyear period during february 2020 we plan to file a new shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission 

our debt issuances in 2019 were as follows 



a interest on these notes is payable semiannually in arrears beginning in november 2019 

b interest on these notes is payable semiannually in arrears beginning in august 2019 

c interest on these notes is payable annually in arrears beginning in august 2020 

d usd equivalents for foreign currency notes were calculated based on exchange rates on the date of issuance 

the net proceeds from the sale of the securities listed in the table above have been and will be used for general corporate purposes including repayment of outstanding commercial paper and refinancing of outstanding 2000 notes due 2020 outstanding floating rate notes due 2020 and outstanding euro denominated 1750 notes due 2020 

the weightedaverage time to maturity of our longterm debt was 102 years at the end of 2019 and 96 years at the end of 2018  

 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements including special purpose entities other than guarantees and contractual obligations discussed below 

guarantees – at december 31 2019  we were contingently liable for 05 billion of guarantees of our own performance of which 03 billion related to our obligations under indemnity agreements to enable appeals of customs assessments against our distributors and 02 billion were primarily related to excise taxes on the shipment of our products there is no liability in the consolidated financial statements associated with these guarantees at december 31 2019  our thirdparty guarantees were insignificant 

aggregate contractual obligations – the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2019  



1 amounts represent the expected cash payments at the face value of our longterm debt and finance lease obligations for further details see item 8 note 7 indebtedness to our consolidated financial statements 

2 amounts represent the expected cash payments of our interest expense on our longterm debt including the current portion of longterm debt interest on our fixedrate debt is presented using the stated interest rate interest on our variable debt is estimated using the rate in effect at december 31 2019 amounts exclude the amortization of debt discounts the amortization of loan fees and fees for lines of credit that would be included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of earnings 

3 amounts represent the maturity of pmis operating lease liabilities on an undiscounted basis 

4 purchase obligations for inventory and production costs such as raw materials indirect materials and supplies packaging comanufacturing arrangements storage and distribution are commitments for projected needs to be utilized in the normal course of business other purchase obligations include commitments for marketing advertising capital expenditures information technology and professional services other purchase obligations also include the expected future contributions to the foundation for a smokefree world for further details see business environment — other developments  arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction amounts represent the minimum commitments under noncancelable contracts any amounts reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as accounts payable and accrued liabilities are excluded from the table above 

5 other longterm liabilities consist primarily of transition tax as discussed in item 8 note 11 income taxes to our consolidated financial statements postretirement health care costs accruals established for employment costs and accruals established for exit activities for further details see note 21 asset impairment and exit costs  the following longterm liabilities included on the consolidated balance sheet are excluded from the table above accrued pension and postemployment costs tax contingencies insurance accruals and other accruals we are unable to estimate the timing of payments or contributions in the case of accrued pension costs for these items currently we anticipate making pension contributions of approximately 77 million in 2020  based on current tax and benefit laws as discussed in item 8 note 13 benefit plans to our consolidated financial statements 

Ÿ equity and dividends 

we discuss our stock awards as of december 31 2019  in item 8 note 9 stock plans to our consolidated financial statements 

during 2019  2018 and 2017  we did not repurchase any shares under a share repurchase program and we do not presently intend to repurchase shares of our common stock in 2020  

dividends paid in 2019 were 72 billion  during the third quarter of 2019 our board of directors approved a 26 increase in the quarterly dividend to 117 per common share as a result the present annualized dividend rate is 468 per common share 

market risk 

Ÿ counterparty risk  we predominantly work with financial institutions with strong short and longterm credit ratings as assigned by standard  poor’s and moody’s these banks are also part of a defined group of relationship banks noninvestment grade institutions are only used in certain emerging markets to the extent required by local business needs we have a conservative approach when it comes to choosing financial counterparties and financial instruments as such we do not invest or hold investments in any structured or equitylinked products the majority of our cash and cash equivalents is currently invested in demand deposits maturing within less than 30 days 

we continuously monitor and assess the credit worthiness of all our counterparties 

Ÿ derivative financial instruments  we operate in markets outside of the us with manufacturing and sales facilities in various locations throughout the world consequently we use certain financial instruments to manage our foreign currency and interest rate exposure we use derivative financial instruments principally to reduce our exposure to market risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates by creating offsetting exposures we are not a party to leveraged derivatives and by policy do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 

see item 8 note 15 financial instruments item 8 note 16 fair value measurements and item 8 note 19 balance sheet offsetting to our consolidated financial statements for further details on our derivative financial instruments and the related collateral arrangements 

Ÿ value at risk  we use a value at risk computation to estimate the potential oneday loss in the fair value of our interestratesensitive and foreign currency pricesensitive derivative financial instruments this computation includes our debt and foreign currency forwards swaps and options anticipated transactions foreign currency trade payables and receivables and net investments in foreign subsidiaries which the foregoing instruments are intended to hedge were excluded from the computation 

the computation estimates were made assuming normal market conditions using a 95 confidence interval and a oneday holding period using a parametric deltagamma approximation technique to determine the observed interrelationships between movements in interest rates and various currencies and in calculating the risk of the underlying positions in the portfolio these interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate and forward currency rate movements primarily over the preceding quarter for determining value at risk at december 31 2019 and 2018  and primarily over each of the four preceding quarters for the calculation of average value at risk amounts during each year 



the value at risk computation is a risk analysis tool designed to statistically estimate the maximum probable daily loss from adverse movements in interest and foreign currency rates under normal market conditions the computation does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value or earnings to be incurred by us nor does it consider the effect of favorable changes in market rates we cannot predict actual future movements in such market rates and do not present these results to be indicative of future movements in market rates or to 

be representative of any actual impact that future changes in market rates may have on our future results of operations or financial position

general development of business 

  

general 

  

philip morris international inc is a virginia holding company incorporated in 1987 we are a leading international tobacco company engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes smokefree products and associated electronic devices and accessories and other nicotinecontaining products in markets outside the united states of america 

we are leading a transformation in the tobacco industry to create a smokefree future based on a new category of reducedrisk products that while not riskfree are a much better choice than continuing to smoke our goal is to ultimately replace cigarettes with smokefree products to the benefit of adults who would otherwise continue to smoke society the company and its shareholders 

reducedrisk products rrps is the term we use to refer to products that present are likely to present or have the potential to present less risk of harm to smokers who switch to these products versus continued smoking we have a range of rrps in various stages of development scientific assessment and commercialization because our rrps do not burn tobacco they produce an aerosol that contains far lower quantities of harmful and potentially harmful constituents than found in cigarette smoke through multidisciplinary capabilities in product development stateoftheart facilities and scientific substantiation we aim to ensure that our rrps meet adult consumer preferences and rigorous regulatory requirements 

our iqos smokefree   product brand portfolio includes heated tobacco and nicotinecontaining vapor products our leading smokefree platform is a precisely controlled device into which a specially designed heated tobacco unit is inserted and heated to generate an aerosol we market our heated tobacco units under the brand names heets  heets marlboro and heets from marlboro  defined collectively as heets  as well as marlboro heatsticks and parliament heatsticks  iqos was first introduced in nagoya japan in 2014 to date iqos is available for sale in 44 markets in key cities or nationwide 

our cigarettes are sold in more than 180 markets and in many of these markets they hold the number one or number two market share position we have a wide range of premium midprice and lowprice brands our portfolio comprises both international and local brands and is led by marlboro  the world’s bestselling international cigarette which accounted for approximately 36  of our total 2018  cigarette shipment volume marlboro is complemented in the premiumprice category by parliament  our other leading international cigarette brands are bond street chesterfield lm  lark and philip morris these seven international cigarette brands contributed approximately 76  of our cigarette shipment volume in 2018  we also own a number of important local cigarette brands such as dji sam soe  sampoerna a and sampoerna u in indonesia fortune and jackpot in the philippines and belmont and canadian classics in canada 

source of funds — dividends 

  

we are a legal entity separate and distinct from our direct and indirect subsidiaries accordingly our right and thus the right of our creditors and stockholders to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of any subsidiary is subject to the prior rights of creditors of such subsidiary except to the extent that claims of our company itself as a creditor may be recognized as a holding company our principal sources of funds including funds to make payment on our debt securities are from the receipt of dividends and repayment of debt from our subsidiaries our principal wholly owned and majorityowned subsidiaries currently are not limited by longterm debt or other agreements in their ability to pay cash dividends or to make other distributions with respect to their common stock that are otherwise compliant with law 

  

description of business 

  

to provide a greater focus on both parts of our business —  combustible and reducedrisk products —  and to support our transformation toward a smokefree future effective january 1 2018 we began managing our business in six reportable segments as follows 



 1 

 

our total shipments including cigarettes and heated tobacco units decreased  by 21  in 2018  to 7817 billion  units we estimate that international industry volumes including cigarettes and heated tobacco units were approximately 51 trillion  units in 2018  a 08   decrease  over 2017  excluding the people’s republic of china “prc” we estimate that the international cigarette and heated tobacco unit volume was 28 trillion  units in 2018  a 16   decrease  over 2017  we estimate that our reported share of the international market which is defined as worldwide cigarette and heated tobacco unit volume excluding the united states of america was approximately 153  in 2018  152  in 2017  and 155  in 2016  excluding the prc we estimate that our reported share of the international market was approximately 284  279  and 281  in 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively 

  

shipments of our principal cigarette brand marlboro  decreased  by 22  in 2018  and represented approximately 97  of the international cigarette market excluding the prc in 2018  97  in 2017  and 96  in 2016  

  

we have a market share of at least 15 and in a number of instances substantially more than 15 in approximately 100 markets including algeria argentina australia austria belgium brazil canada canary islands the czech republic egypt france germany hong kong indonesia israel italy japan korea kuwait mexico the netherlands the philippines poland portugal russia saudi arabia singapore spain switzerland turkey and ukraine 

  

heated tobacco units is the term we use to refer to heated tobacco consumables which for us include our heets   heets marlboro and heets from marlboro  defined collectively as heets  as well as marlboro   heatsticks and  parliament heatsticks total shipment volume of heated tobacco units reached 414 billion  units in 2018  up  from 362 billion  units in 2017  

references to total international market defined as worldwide cigarette and heated tobacco unit volume excluding the united states total industry total market and market shares in this form 10k are our estimates for taxpaid products based on the latest available data from a number of internal and external sources 

distribution  sales 

our main types of distribution are tailored to the characteristics of each market and are often used simultaneously 

  

   

 2 

competition 

  

we are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business we compete primarily on the basis of product quality brand recognition brand loyalty taste rd innovation packaging customer service marketing advertising and retail price and increasingly adult smoker willingness to convert to our rrps our competitors include three large international tobacco companies and several regional and local tobacco companies and in some instances stateowned tobacco enterprises principally in algeria egypt the prc taiwan thailand and vietnam industry consolidation and privatizations of stateowned enterprises have led to an overall increase in competitive pressures some competitors have different profit and volume objectives and some international competitors are susceptible to changes in different currency exchange rates in the combustible product category we predominantly sell american blend cigarette brands such as marlboro  lm   parliament philip morris  and chesterfield  which are the most popular across many of our markets in the rrp product category we predominantly sell iqos  devices and heated tobacco units we seek to compete in all profitable retail price categories although our brand portfolio is weighted towards the premiumprice category 

  procurement and raw materials 

  

we purchase tobacco leaf of various types grades and styles throughout the world mostly through independent tobacco suppliers we also contract directly with farmers in several countries including argentina brazil colombia ecuador italy pakistan the philippines and poland in 2018 direct sourcing from farmers represented approximately 24 of pmi’s global leaf requirements the largest supplies of tobacco leaf are sourced from argentina brazil china italy indonesia mostly for domestic use in kretek products malawi mozambique philippines turkey and the united states 

we believe that there is an adequate supply of tobacco leaf in the world markets to satisfy our current and anticipated production requirements 

in addition to tobacco leaf we purchase a wide variety of direct materials from a total of approximately 500 suppliers in 2018 our top ten suppliers of direct materials combined represented approximately 50 of our total direct materials purchases the three most significant direct materials that we purchase are printed paper board used in packaging acetate tow used in filter making and fine paper used in the manufacturing of cigarettes and heated tobacco units in addition the adequate supply and procurement of cloves are of particular importance to our indonesian business 

the adequate supply chain for our rrp portfolio including the supply of electronic devices is important to our business we work with two electronics manufacturing service providers for the supply of our iqos  devices and a small number of other providers for other products in our rrp portfolio and related accessories although we work closely with these service providers on monitoring their production capability and financial health the commercialization of our rrps could be adversely affected if they are unable to meet their commitments the production of our rrp portfolio requires various metals and we believe that there is an adequate supply of such metals in the world markets to satisfy our current and anticipated production requirements however some components and materials necessary for the production of our rrps are obtained from single or limited sources and can be subject to industrywide shortages and price fluctuations our inability to secure an adequate supply of such components and materials could negatively impact the commercialization of our rrps 

our iqos  devices are subject to product warranties which are described in more detail in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k “item 8” in note 5  product warranty  to our consolidated financial statements we discuss our rrp products in more detail in item 7  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this annual report on form 10k “item 7” in  business environment—reduced risk products

other matters 

  

customers 

  

as described in more detail in “ distribution  sales ” above in many of our markets we sell our products to distributors in 2018 sales to a distributor in the european union region and a distributor in the east asia  australia region each amounted to 10 percent or more of our consolidated net revenues see item 8 note 12 segment reporting  for more information we believe that none of our business segments is dependent upon a single customer or a few customers the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations in some of our markets particularly in the european union and in the east asia  australia regions a loss of a distributor may result in a temporary market disruption 

  

employees 

    

at december 31 2018  we employed approximately 77400  people worldwide including fulltime temporary and parttime staff our businesses are subject to a number of laws and regulations relating to our relationship with our employees generally these laws and regulations are specific to the location of each business in addition in accordance with european union requirements we have established a european works council composed of management and elected members of our workforce we believe that our relations with our employees and their representative organizations are excellent

our trademarks are valuable assets and their protection and reputation are essential to us we own the trademark rights to all of our principal brands including marlboro  and iqos  or have the right to use them in all countries where we use them

the parties agreed to submit disputes under the intellectual property agreement first to negotiation between senior executives and then to binding arbitration

 item 1a   risk factors 

    

the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report on form 10k any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business our operating results our financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forwardlooking statements are made in this annual report on form 10k 

forwardlooking and cautionary statements 

we may from time to time make written or oral forwardlooking statements including statements contained in this annual report on form 10k and other filings with the sec in reports to stockholders and in press releases and investor webcasts you can identify these forwardlooking statements by use of words such as strategy expects continues plans anticipates believes will estimates intends projects goals targets and other words of similar meaning you can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 

we cannot guarantee that any forwardlooking statement will be realized although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions our rrps constitute a new product category in its early stages that is less predictable than our mature cigarette business achievement of future results is subject to risks uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate actual results could vary materially from those anticipated estimated or projected investors should bear this in mind as they consider forwardlooking statements and whether to invest in or remain invested in our securities in connection with the “safe harbor” provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 we are identifying important factors that individually or in the aggregate could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements made by us any such statement is qualified by reference to the following cautionary statements we elaborate on these and other risks we face throughout this document particularly in item 7 business environment  you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors consequently you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion 

 5 

of all potential risks or uncertainties we do not undertake to update any forwardlooking statement that we may make from time to time except in the normal course of our public disclosure obligations 

risks related to our business and industry 

 this decline is due to multiple factors including increased taxes and pricing governmental actions the diminishing social acceptance of smoking continuing economic and geopolitical uncertainty and the continuing prevalence of illicit products these factors and their potential consequences are discussed more fully below and in item 7 business environment  

 tax regimes including excise taxes sales taxes and import duties can disproportionately affect the retail price of cigarettes versus other combustible tobacco products or disproportionately affect the relative retail price of our cigarette brands versus cigarette brands manufactured by certain of our competitors because our portfolio is weighted toward the premiumprice cigarette category tax regimes based on sales price can place us at a competitive disadvantage in certain markets as a result our volume and profitability may be adversely affected in these markets 

increases in cigarette taxes are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on our sales of cigarettes due to resulting lower consumption levels a shift in sales from manufactured cigarettes to other combustible tobacco products and from the premiumprice to the midprice or lowprice cigarette categories where we may be underrepresented from local sales to legal crossborder purchases of lower price products or to illicit products such as contraband counterfeit and illicit whites 

 governmental actions combined with the diminishing social acceptance of smoking and private actions to restrict smoking have resulted in reduced industry volume in many of our markets and we expect that such factors will continue to reduce consumption levels and will increase downtrading and the risk of counterfeiting contraband illicit whites and legal crossborder purchases significant regulatory developments will continue to take place over the next few years in most of our markets driven principally by the world health organizations framework convention on tobacco control “fctc” since it came into force in 2005 the fctc has led to increased efforts by tobacco control advocates and public health organizations to promote increasingly restrictive regulatory measures on the marketing and sale of tobacco products to adult smokers regulatory initiatives that have been proposed introduced or enacted include 



 6 

our financial results could be significantly affected by regulatory initiatives resulting in a significant decrease in demand for our brands in particular requirements that lead to a commoditization of tobacco products or impede adult consumers ability to convert to our rrps as well as any significant increase in the cost of complying with new regulatory requirements 

 

there is litigation related to tobacco products pending in certain jurisdictions damages claimed in some tobaccorelated litigation are significant and in certain cases in brazil canada israel and nigeria range into the billions of us dollars we anticipate that new cases will continue to be filed the fctc encourages litigation against tobacco product manufacturers it is possible that our consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation see item 8 note 18 contingencies to our condensed consolidated financial statements for a discussion of pending litigation and item 7 business environment—reducedrisk products rrps—legal challenges to rrps 

 we compete primarily on the basis of product quality brand recognition brand loyalty taste rd innovation packaging customer service marketing advertising and retail price and increasingly adult smoker willingness to convert to our rrps we are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business the competitive environment and our competitive position can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions erosion of consumer confidence competitors introduction of lowerprice products or innovative products higher tobacco product taxes higher absolute prices and larger gaps between retail price categories and product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate tobacco products and restricts adult consumer access to truthful and nonmisleading information about our rrps competitors include three large international tobacco companies new market entrants particularly with respect to innovative products several regional and local tobacco companies and in some instances stateowned tobacco enterprises principally in algeria egypt the prc taiwan thailand and vietnam industry consolidation and privatizations of stateowned enterprises have led to an overall increase in competitive pressures some competitors have different profit and volume objectives and some international competitors are susceptible to changes in different currency exchange rates certain new market entrants may alienate consumers from innovative products through inappropriate marketing campaigns and messaging and inferior product satisfaction while not relying on scientific substantiation based on appropriate rd protocols and standards the growing use of digital media could increase the speed and extent of the dissemination of inaccurate and misleading information about our rrps 

 some of the countries in which we operate face the threat of civil unrest and can be subject to regime changes in others nationalization terrorism conflict and the threat of war may have a significant impact on the business environment natural disasters pandemics economic political regulatory or other developments could disrupt our supply chain manufacturing capabilities or distribution capabilities in addition such developments could lead to loss of property or equipment that are critical to our business in certain markets and difficulty in staffing and managing our operations which could reduce our volumes revenues and net earnings 

in certain markets we are dependent on governmental approvals of various actions such as price changes and failure to obtain such approvals could impair growth of our profitability 

in addition despite our high ethical standards and rigorous control and compliance procedures aimed at preventing and detecting unlawful conduct given the breadth and scope of our international operations we may not be able to detect all potential improper or unlawful conduct by our employees and partners

 our business is subject to changes in adult consumer preferences which may be influenced by local economic conditions to be successful we must 

 in periods of economic uncertainty adult consumers may tend to purchase lowerprice brands and the volume of our premiumprice and midprice brands and our profitability could suffer accordingly such downtrading trends may be reinforced by regulation that limits branding communication and product differentiation 

 our rrps are novel products in a new category and the pace at which adult smokers adopt them may vary depending on the competitive regulatory fiscal and cultural environment and other factors in a specific market there may be periods of accelerated growth and periods of slower growth for these products the timing and drivers of which may be more difficult for us to predict versus our mature cigarette business the impact of this lower predictability on our projected results for a specific period may be significant particularly during the early stages of this new product category 

 large quantities of counterfeit cigarettes are sold in the international market we believe that marlboro  is the most heavily counterfeited international cigarette brand although we cannot quantify the revenues we lose as a result of this activity in addition our revenues are reduced by contraband legal crossborder purchases “illicit whites” and nontaxpaid volume produced by local manufacturers our revenues and consumer satisfaction with our iqos  device and heated tobacco units may be adversely affected by counterfeit products that do not meet our product quality standards and scientific validation procedures 

 investigations include allegations of contraband shipments of cigarettes allegations of unlawful pricing activities within certain markets allegations of underpayment of customs duties andor excise taxes allegations of false and misleading usage of descriptors and allegations of unlawful advertising we cannot predict the outcome of those investigations or whether additional investigations may be commenced and it is possible that our business could be materially affected by an unfavorable outcome of pending or future investigations see item 8 note 18 contingencies—other litigation  and item 7 business environment—governmental investigations  for a description of certain governmental investigations to which we are subject

our key strategic priorities are to develop and commercialize products that present less risk of harm to adult smokers who switch to those products versus continued smoking and to convince current adult smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke to switch to those rrps for our efforts to be successful we must develop rrps that such adult smokers find acceptable alternatives to smoking conduct rigorous scientific studies to substantiate that they reduce exposure to harmful and potentially harmful constituents in smoke and ultimately that these products present are likely to present or have the potential to present less risk of harm to adult smokers who switch to them versus continued smoking and effectively advocate for the development of sciencebased regulatory frameworks for the development and commercialization of rrps including communication of scientifically substantiated information to enable adult smokers to make better consumer choices we might not succeed in our efforts if we do not succeed but others do we may be at a competitive disadvantage furthermore we cannot predict whether regulators will permit the sale andor marketing of rrps with scientifically substantiated riskreduction claims such restrictions could limit the success of our rrps 

 

to date we have been largely successful in demonstrating to regulators that our rrps are not cigarettes and as such they are generally taxed either as a separate category or as other tobacco products which typically yields more favorable tax rates than cigarettes if we cease to be successful in these efforts rrp unit margins may be adversely affected 

 we conduct our business primarily in local currency and for purposes of financial reporting the local currency results are translated into us dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period during times of a strengthening us dollar our reported net revenues operating income and eps will be reduced because the local currency translates into fewer us dollars during periods of local economic crises foreign currencies may be devalued significantly against the us dollar reducing our margins actions to recover margins may result in lower volume and a weaker competitive position 

 the tax cuts and jobs act that was signed into law in december 2017 constitutes a major change to the us tax system our estimated impact of the tax cuts and jobs act is based on management’s current interpretations and our analysis is ongoing our final tax liability may be materially different from current estimates due to developments such as implementing regulations and clarifications in future periods our effective tax rate and our ability to recover deferred tax assets could be subject to additional uncertainty as a result of such developments furthermore changes in the earnings mix or applicable foreign tax laws may result in significant variability in our effective tax rates because we are a us holding company our most significant source of funds is distributions from our nonus subsidiaries certain countries in which we operate have adopted or could institute currency exchange controls that limit or prohibit our local subsidiaries ability to convert local currency into us dollars or to make payments outside the country this could subject us to the risks of local currency devaluation and business disruption 

 our profit growth may suffer if we are unable to introduce new products or enter new markets successfully to raise prices or to improve the proportion of our sales of higher margin products and in higher margin geographies 

 one element of our growth strategy is to strengthen our brand portfolio and market positions through selective acquisitions and the development of strategic business relationships acquisition and strategic business development opportunities are limited and present risks of failing to achieve efficient and effective integration strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings there is no assurance that we will be able to acquire attractive businesses on favorable terms or that future acquisitions or strategic business developments will be accretive to earnings

 as with other agricultural commodities the price of tobacco leaf and cloves can be influenced by imbalances in supply and demand and crop quality can be influenced by variations in weather patterns including those caused by climate change tobacco production in certain countries is subject to a variety of controls including government mandated prices and production control programs changes in the patterns of demand for agricultural products could cause farmers to produce less tobacco or cloves any significant change in tobacco leaf and clove prices quality and quantity could affect our profitability and our business 

 

to be successful we must continue transforming our culture and ways of working align our talent with our business needs innovate and transform to a consumercentric business we compete for talent including in areas that are new to us such as digital and technical solutions with companies in the consumer products technology and other sectors that enjoy greater societal acceptance as a result we may be unable to attract and retain the best global talent with the right degree of diversity experience and skills to achieve our strategic goals 

 we use information systems to help manage business processes collect and interpret data and communicate internally and externally with employees suppliers consumers customers and others some of these information systems are managed by thirdparty service providers we have backup systems and business continuity plans in place and we take care to protect our systems and data from unauthorized access nevertheless failure of our systems to function as intended or penetration of our systems by outside parties intent on extracting or corrupting information or otherwise disrupting business processes could place us at a competitive disadvantage result in a loss of revenue assets or personal or other sensitive data litigation and regulatory action cause damage to our reputation and that of our brands and result in significant remediation and other costs failure to protect personal data respect the rights of data subjects and adhere to strict cybersecurity protocols could subject us to substantial fines and other legal challenges under regulations such as the eu general data protection regulation as we are increasingly relying on digital platforms in our business the magnitude of these risks is likely to increase 

 

in certain instances we contract with third parties to manufacture some of our products or product parts or to provide other services we may be unable to renew these agreements on satisfactory terms for numerous reasons including government regulations accordingly our costs may increase significantly if we must replace such third parties with our own resources

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this annual report on form 10k including the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in item 8 and the discussion of risks and cautionary factors that may affect future results in item 1a risk factors  



description of our company   

we are leading a transformation in the tobacco industry to create a smokefree future and ultimately replace cigarettes with smokefree products to the benefit of adults who would otherwise continue to smoke society the company and its shareholders we are a leading international tobacco company engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes smokefree products and associated electronic devices and accessories and other nicotinecontaining products in markets outside the united states of america we are building a future on a new category of smokefree products that while not riskfree are a much better choice than continuing to smoke through multidisciplinary capabilities in product development stateoftheart facilities and scientific substantiation we aim to ensure that our smokefree products meet adult consumer preferences and rigorous regulatory requirements our iqos  smokefree product brand portfolio includes heated tobacco and nicotinecontaining vapor products 

to provide a greater focus on both parts of our business —  combustible and reducedrisk products —  and to support our transformation toward a smokefree future effective january 1 2018 we began managing our business in six reportable segments as follows 

  

 

our cigarettes are sold in more than 180 markets and in many of these markets they hold the number one or number two market share position we have a wide range of premium midprice and lowprice brands our   portfolio comprises both international and local brands in addition to the manufacture and sale of cigarettes we are engaged in the development and commercialization of reducedrisk products rrps rrps is the term we use to refer to products that present are likely to present or have the potential to present less risk of harm to smokers who switch to these products versus continued smoking 

we use the term net revenues to refer to our operating revenues from the sale of our products including shipping and handling charges billed to customers net of sales and promotion incentives and excise taxes as discussed in item 8 note 21 new accounting standards  on january 1 2018 we adopted financial accounting standards update asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers we adopted this standard retrospectively to each prior period presented we made an accounting policy election to exclude excise taxes collected from customers from the measurement of the transaction price thereby presenting revenues net of excise taxes in all prior periods our net revenues and operating income are affected by various factors including the volume of products we sell the price of our products changes in currency exchange rates and the mix of products we sell mix is a term used to refer to the proportionate value of premiumprice brands to midprice or lowprice brands in any given market product mix mix can also refer to the proportion of shipment volume in more profitable markets versus shipment volume in less profitable markets geographic mix 

our cost of sales consists principally of tobacco leaf nontobacco raw materials labor and manufacturing costs shipping and handling costs and the cost of the iqos  devices produced by thirdparty electronics manufacturing service providers estimated costs associated with iqos  warranty programs are generally provided for in cost of sales in the period the related revenues are recognized 

our marketing administration and research costs include the costs of marketing and selling our products other costs generally not related to the manufacture of our products including general corporate expenses and costs incurred to develop new products the most significant components of our marketing administration and research costs are marketing and sales expenses and general and administrative expenses 

philip morris international inc is a legal entity separate and distinct from its direct and indirect subsidiaries accordingly our right and thus the right of our creditors and stockholders to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of any subsidiary is subject to the prior rights of creditors of such subsidiary except to the extent that claims of our company itself as a creditor may be recognized as a holding company our principal sources of funds including funds to make payment on our debt securities are from the receipt of 

 15 

dividends and repayment of debt from our subsidiaries our principal wholly owned and majorityowned subsidiaries currently are not limited by longterm debt or other agreements in their ability to pay cash dividends or to make other distributions with respect to their common stock that are otherwise compliant with law 

executive summary 

the following executive summary provides significant highlights from the discussion and analysis that follows 

consolidated operating results 

 

net revenues excluding unfavorable  currency increased  by 34  reflecting a favorable  pricing variance notably in argentina australia canada egypt germany indonesia italy japan mexico the philippines russia turkey and ukraine partly offset by france korea saudi arabia and thailand as well as a favorable other variance attributable to 2018 fees for certain distribution rights billed to customers in certain markets in the mea region 

these favorable variances were partly offset by unfavorable  volumemix primarily reflecting unfavorable cigarette volumemix notably in australia the gulf cooperation council gcc notably saudi arabia and the united arab emirates uae indonesia italy japan and russia partly offset by pakistan thailand and turkey the unfavorable cigarette volumemix was partly offset by favorable heated tobacco unit volume in the eu notably the czech republic germany and italy as well as korea pmi duty free and russia partly offset by unfavorable heated tobacco unit volume in japan reflecting the net impact of estimated distributor inventory movements 

net revenues by product category for the years ended december 31   2018  and 2017  are shown below

income taxes  –  our effective income tax rate for 2018   decreased  by 178  percentage points to 229  the 2018  tax items that decreased  our 2018  diluted eps by 002  per share in the table above represented a current income tax charge of 185 million primarily due to an increase in our final 2017 transition tax liability mostly offset by a deferred income tax benefit of 154 million primarily due to the recognition of deferred tax assets for net operating losses in the state of new york the 2017  tax items that decreased  our 2017  diluted eps by 084  per share in the table above were primarily due to the impact of the tax cuts and jobs act which was signed into law in december 2017 the change in the effective tax rate that increased  our diluted eps by 040  per share in the table above was primarily due to the impact from the tax cuts and jobs act which reduced the us federal income tax rate from 35 to 21 in addition to repatriation cost differences and earnings mix by taxing jurisdiction for further details see item 8 note 11 income taxes to our consolidated financial statements 

currency  –  the unfavorable  currency impact during 2018  results from the fluctuations of the us dollar especially against the indonesian rupiah russian ruble and turkish lira partially offset by the euro and japanese yen this unfavorable  currency movement has impacted our profitability across our primary revenue markets and local currency cost bases 

interest  –  the favorable  impact of interest was due primarily to our ongoing efforts to optimize our capital structure following the passage of the tax cuts and jobs act this included the decision to use existing cash to repay the 25 billion principal for our matured may 2018 tenyear us bond which had a coupon of 565 

operations  –  the decrease  in diluted eps of 004  from our operations in the table above was due primarily to the following segments 

 partially offset by 



 17 

 

for further details see the consolidated operating results  and operating results by business segment  sections of the following discussion and analysis  

tax items and impact of us tax reform 

we completed our analysis of the tax cuts and jobs act during 2018 and adjusted the 2017 provisional estimates to the final amounts based on our 2017 us federal income tax return as filed accordingly in the fourth quarter 2018 we recorded in our income tax provision a charge of 31 million representing a current income tax charge of 185 million primarily due to an increase in our aggregate foreign cash position used to determine our final 2017 transition tax liability mostly offset by a deferred income tax benefit of 154 million primarily due to the recognition of deferred tax assets for net operating losses in the state of new york updates to the provisional estimates have been recorded in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 118 sab 118 

we estimate that our 2019  effective tax rate will be approximately 23  reflecting the current analysis interpretation and clarifications of the scope and impact of the tax cuts and jobs act 

the tax cuts and jobs act has significant complexity and our final fullyear effective tax rate may differ from this estimate due to among other things additional guidance that may be issued by the us treasury department and the internal revenue service related interpretations and clarifications of tax law in addition to repatriation costs differences and earnings mix by taxing jurisdiction 

discussion and analysis 

critical accounting estimates 

item 8 note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in most instances we must use a particular accounting policy or method because it is the only one that is permitted under us gaap 

the preparation of financial statements requires that we use estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets liabilities net revenues and expenses as well as our disclosure of contingencies if actual amounts differ from previous estimates we include the revisions in our consolidated results of operations in the period during which we know the actual amounts historically aggregate differences if any between our estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 

the selection and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates have been discussed with our audit committee the following is a discussion of the more significant assumptions estimates accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition   we recognize revenue as performance obligations are satisfied our primary performance obligation is the distribution and sales of cigarettes and other nicotinecontaining products including reducedrisk products our performance obligations are typically satisfied upon shipment or delivery to our customers the company estimates the cost of sales returns based on historical experience and these estimates are immaterial estimated costs associated with warranty programs for iqos  devices are generally provided for in cost of sales in the period the related revenues are recognized based on a number of factors including historical experience product failure rates and warranty policies the transaction price is typically based on the amount billed to the customer and includes estimated variable consideration where applicable such variable consideration is typically not constrained and is estimated based on the most likely amount that pmi expects to be entitled to under the terms of the contracts with customers historical experience of discount or rebate redemption where relevant and the terms of any underlying discount or rebate programs which may change from time to time as the business and product categories evolve 

inventories  our inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions the valuation of inventory also requires us to estimate obsolete and excess inventory we perform regular reviews of our 

 18 

inventory on hand as well as our future purchase commitments with our suppliers considering multiple factors including demand forecasts product life cycle current sales levels pricing strategy and cost trends if our review indicates that inventories of raw materials components or finished products have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or that inventory cost exceeds net realizable value we may be required to make adjustments that will impact the results of operations 

goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets valuation  we test goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events occur that would warrant such review while the company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment for both goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets to determine if it is more likely than not that an impairment exists the company elects to perform the quantitative assessment for our annual impairment analysis the impairment analysis involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit or nonamortizable intangible asset to the carrying value if the carrying value exceeds the fair value goodwill or a nonamortizable intangible asset is considered impaired to determine the fair value of goodwill we primarily use a discounted cash flow model supported by the market approach using earnings multiples of comparable global and local companies within the tobacco industry at december 31 2018  the carrying value of our goodwill was 72 billion  which is related to ten reporting units each of which consists of a group of markets with similar economic characteristics the estimated fair value of each of our ten reporting units exceeded the carrying value as of december 31 2018  to determine the fair value of nonamortizable intangible assets we primarily use a discounted cash flow model applying the relieffromroyalty method we concluded that the fair value of our nonamortizable intangible assets exceeded the carrying value   these discounted cash flow models include management assumptions relevant for forecasting operating cash flows which are subject to changes in business conditions such as volumes and prices costs to produce discount rates and estimated capital needs management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the fair values are estimated and we believe these assumptions are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use since the march 28 2008 spinoff from altria group inc we have not recorded a charge to earnings for an impairment of goodwill or nonamortizable intangible assets 

marketing costs   we incur certain costs to support our products through programs that include advertising marketing consumer engagement and trade promotions the costs of our advertising and marketing programs are expensed in accordance with us gaap recognition of the cost related to our consumer engagement and trade promotion programs contain uncertainties due to the judgment required in estimating the potential performance and compliance for each program for volumebased incentives provided to customers management continually assesses and estimates by customer the likelihood of the customers achieving the specified targets and records the reduction of revenue as the sales are made for other trade promotions management relies on estimated utilization rates that have been developed from historical experience changes in the assumptions used in estimating the cost of any individual marketing program would not result in a material change in our financial position results of operations or operating cash flows 

employee benefit plans  as discussed in item 8 note 13 benefit plans  to our consolidated financial statements we provide a range of benefits to our employees and retired employees including pensions postretirement health care and postemployment benefits primarily severance we record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by us gaap these calculations include various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates assumed rates of return on plan assets compensation increases mortality turnover rates and health care cost trend rates we review actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so as permitted by us gaap any effect of the modifications is generally amortized over future periods we believe that the assumptions utilized in calculating our obligations under these plans are reasonable based upon our historical experience and advice from our actuaries 

weightedaverage discount rate assumptions for pension and postretirement plan obligations at december 31 2018 and 2017 are as follows 



we anticipate that assumption changes will increase 2019 pretax pension and postretirement expense to approximately 205 million as compared with approximately 160 million in 2018 excluding amounts related to employee severance and early retirement programs the anticipated increase is primarily due to higher amortization out of other comprehensive earnings for unrecognized actuarial gainslosses of 14 million coupled with lower return on assets of 16 million higher interest and service cost of 12 million and 4 million respectively partially offset by other movements of 1 million 

weightedaverage expected rate of return and discount rate assumptions have a significant effect on the amount of expense reported for the employee benefit plans a fiftybasispoint decrease in our discount rate would increase our 2019 pension and postretirement expense by approximately 50 million and a fiftybasispoint increase in our discount rate would decrease our 2019 pension and postretirement 

 19 

expense by approximately 44 million similarly a fiftybasispoint decrease increase in the expected return on plan assets would increase decrease our 2019 pension expense by approximately 33 million 

income taxes   income tax provisions for jurisdictions outside the united states as well as state and local income tax provisions are determined on a separate company basis and the related assets and liabilities are recorded in our consolidated balance sheets 

the extent of our operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions the final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal state and international tax audits in accordance with the authoritative guidance for income taxes we evaluate potential tax exposures and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment an additional charge to expense would result if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 

we are required to assess the likelihood of recovering deferred tax assets against future sources of taxable income if we determine using all available evidence that we do not reach the more likely than not threshold for recovery a valuation allowance is recorded significant judgment is required in determining the need for and amount of valuation allowances for deferred tax assets including estimates of future taxable income in the applicable jurisdictions and the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies as applicable 

the effective tax rates used for interim reporting are based on our fullyear geographic earnings mix projections changes in currency exchange rates or earnings mix by taxing jurisdiction could have an impact on the effective tax rates significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions 

for further details see item 8 note 11 income taxes  to our consolidated financial statements 

hedging  as discussed below in “market risk” we use derivative financial instruments principally to reduce exposures to market risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates by creating offsetting exposures for derivatives to which we have elected to apply hedge accounting gains and losses on these derivatives are initially deferred in accumulated other comprehensive losses on the consolidated balance sheet and recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings into the same line item as the impact of the underlying transaction the periods when the related hedged transactions are also recognized in operating results if we had elected not to use the hedge accounting provisions gains losses deferred in stockholders’ deficit equity would have been recorded in our net earnings for these derivatives 

contingencies  as   discussed in item 8 note 18 contingencies  to our consolidated financial statements legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened against us andor our subsidiaries andor our indemnitees in various jurisdictions we and our subsidiaries record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated the variability in pleadings in multiple jurisdictions together with the actual experience of management in litigating claims demonstrate that the monetary relief that may be specified in a lawsuit bears little relevance to the ultimate outcome much of the tobaccorelated litigation is in its early stages and litigation is subject to uncertainty at the present time while it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur after assessing the information available to it i management has not concluded that it is probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending tobaccorelated cases ii management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss for any of the pending tobaccorelated cases and iii accordingly no estimated loss has been accrued in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes in these cases if any legal defense costs are expensed as incurred

from time to time pmi’s shipment volumes are subject to the impact of distributor inventory movements and estimated total industrymarket volumes are subject to the impact of inventory movements in various trade channels that include estimated trade inventory movements of pmi’s competitors arising from marketspecific factors that significantly distort reported volume disclosures such factors may include changes to the manufacturing supply chain shipment methods consumer demand timing of excise tax increases or other influences that may affect the timing of sales to customers in such instances in addition to reviewing pmi shipment volumes and certain estimated total industrymarket volumes on a reported basis management reviews these measures on an adjusted basis that excludes the impact of distributor andor estimated trade inventory movements management also believes that disclosing pmi shipment volumes and estimated total industrymarket volumes in such circumstances on a basis that excludes the impact of distributor andor estimated trade inventory movements improves the comparability of performance and trends for these measures over different reporting periods 

2018  compared with 2017   

the following discussion compares our consolidated operating results for the year ended december 31 2018  with the year ended december 31 2017

the unfavorable  currency in net revenues was due primarily to the argentine peso indonesian rupiah philippine peso russian ruble and turkish lira partially offset by the euro japanese yen and polish zloty 

net revenues include 41 billion  in 2018  and 36 billion  in 2017  related to the sale of rrps in 2018  approximately 09 billion of our 41 billion  in rrp net revenues were from iqos  devices and accessories 

operating income excluding unfavorable  currency was essentially flat reflecting a favorable  pricing variance partly offset by unfavorable  volumemix due mainly to lower volume in japan and saudi arabia and lower mix in indonesia and russia partly offset by higher volume in the eu driven by heated tobacco units as well as korea pmi duty free thailand and turkey the favorable pricing variance was also partly offset by higher marketing administration and research costs primarily related to increased investment behind reducedrisk products across all regions predominantly the eu and eaa 

interest expense net of 665 million   decreased  by 249 million   272  due primarily to our ongoing efforts to optimize our capital structure following the passage of the tax cuts and jobs act this included the decision to use existing cash to repay the 25 billion principal for our matured may 2018 tenyear us bond which had a coupon of 565 

our effective tax rate decreased  by 178  percentage points to 229  the change in the effective tax rate for 2018  as compared to 2017  was primarily due to the tax cuts and jobs act which reduced the us federal income tax rate from 35 to 21 in addition to repatriation cost differences and earnings mix by taxing jurisdiction we completed our analysis of the tax cuts and jobs act during 2018 and adjusted the 2017 provisional estimates to the final amounts based on our 2017 us federal income tax return as filed accordingly we recorded in our income tax provision a charge of 31 million representing a current income tax charge of 185 million primarily due to an increase in our final 2017 transition tax liability mostly offset by a deferred income tax benefit of 154 million primarily due to the recognition of deferred tax assets for net operating losses in the state of new york the effective tax rate in 2017  was unfavorably impacted by 16 billion due to the tax cuts and jobs act we estimate that our 2019  effective tax rate will be approximately 23  subject to future regulatory developments and earnings mix by taxing jurisdiction for further details see item 8 note 11 income taxes  

 26 

we are regularly examined by tax authorities around the world and we are currently under examination in a number of jurisdictions it is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months certain tax examinations will close which could result in a change in unrecognized tax benefits along with related interest and penalties an estimate of any possible change cannot be made at this time 

net earnings attributable to pmi of 79 billion   increased  by 19 billion   311  this increase  was due primarily to a lower effective tax rate and lower interest expense net partially offset by lower  operating income diluted and basic eps of 508   increased  by 309  excluding a net favorable tax impact of  082  primarily related to the implementation of the tax cuts and jobs act and an unfavorable  currency impact of 011  diluted eps increased  by 104  

2017  compared with 2016   

the following discussion compares our consolidated operating results for the year ended december 31 2017  with the year ended december 31 2016  

estimated international cigarette and heated tobacco unit volume excluding china and the united states of 28 trillion  was down  by 28  

our total shipment volume decreased  by 27  principally due to 

 partially offset by 

 

excluding the favorable net impact of estimated cigarette and heated tobacco unit inventory movements of approximately 33 billion units our total shipment volume decreased by 31  the favorable inventory movements were driven primarily by approximately 85 billion units net in japan reflecting the increasing demand for heatsticks  anticipated to further increase in the first quarter of 2018 following a planned lifting of the restriction on iqos device sales the establishment of appropriate distributor inventory levels of heated tobacco units given the current high dependence on a single manufacturing center and the transition from air freight to sea freight of heated tobacco units largely completed in the fourth quarter of 2017 these favorable inventory movements were partly offset by a reduction of combustible product inventory levels mainly in italy north africa russia saudi arabia and spain 

 27 

our cigarette shipment volume by brand and heated tobacco unit shipment volume was as follows 



others above also include cigarette shipment volumes of sampoerna a   including sampoerna  of 42736 million  units in 2017  and 44548 million  units in 2016  dji sam soe  of 22757 million  units in 2017  and 20411 million  units in 2016  and fortune  of 13451 million  units in 2017  and 18570 million  units in 2016  

note philip morris  includes philip morrisdubliss  and lark  includes lark harmony  

cigarette shipment volume of  marlboro  decreased in the eu mainly due to greece italy and spain mea predominantly due to saudi arabia reflecting the impact of the new excise tax implemented in june 2017 that resulted in the doubling of the retail price of marlboro  from sar 12 to sar 24 per pack partly offset by north africa notably algeria and egypt and turkey eaa mainly due to japan and korea principally reflecting outswitching to heated tobacco products and lac mainly due to argentina and brazil partly offset by an increase in ssa mainly due to indonesia and the philippines 

cigarette shipment volume of the following brands decreased lm  mainly due to russia saudi arabia and turkey partly offset by algeria argentina colombia and kazakhstan parliament  mainly due to japan russia and saudi arabia partly offset by kazakhstan bond street  mainly due to kazakhstan russia and ukraine lark  principally due to japan and others mainly due to lowprice brands in indonesia pakistan the philippines russia and ukraine 

cigarette shipment volume of the following brands increased chesterfield  notably driven by argentina brazil colombia saudi arabia turkey and venezuela partly offset by italy and russia and philip morris  mainly driven by russia and ukraine notably reflecting successful portfolio consolidation of local lowprice brands in others partly offset by argentina and italy

key market data regarding total market size our shipments and market share were as follows 



 29 



“costother” in the above table reflects the currencyneutral variances of cost of sales excluding the volumemix cost component marketing administration and research costs asset impairment and exit costs and amortization of intangibles 

net revenues increased  by 77  due to price increases and favorable volumemix partially offset by unfavorable currency 

the unfavorable currency in net revenues was due primarily to the argentine peso egyptian pound japanese yen philippine peso and turkish lira partially offset by the russian ruble 

  

net revenues for rrps were 36 billion  in 2017  and 733 million  in 2016  mainly in japan    in 2017  approximately 09 billion of our 36 billion  in rrp net revenues were from iqos  devices and accessories 

cost of sales increased by 111  due to higher cost of sales resulting from volumemix partly offset by lower manufacturing costs and favorable currency 

marketing administration and research costs increased by 52  largely reflecting increased investment behind reducedrisk products predominately in the european union and east asia  australia partly offset by favorable currency 

operating income increased by 62  due primarily to price increases partly offset by higher marketing administration and research costs and unfavorable currency 

interest expense net of 914 million increased by 23 million due primarily to unfavorable currency and higher average debt levels partly offset by higher interest income 

our effective tax rate increased by 128 percentage points to 407 the 2017 effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by 16 billion due to the tax cuts and jobs act for further details see item 8 note 11 income taxes  to our consolidated financial statements 

net earnings attributable to pmi of 60 billion decreased by 932 million 134 this decrease was due primarily to a higher effective tax rate as discussed above partly offset by higher operating income diluted and basic eps of 388 decreased by 134 excluding an unfavorable tax impact of 084 primarily related to the implementation of the tax cuts and jobs act and an unfavorable currency impact of 021 diluted eps increased by 100 

operating results by business segment 

business environment 

taxes legislation regulation and other matters regarding the manufacture marketing sale and use of tobacco products 

the tobacco industry and our business face a number of challenges that may adversely affect our business volume results of operations cash flows and financial position these challenges which are discussed below and in “ cautionary factors that may affect future results ” include 

 30 

 

regulatory restrictions  the tobacco industry operates in a highly regulated environment the wellknown risks of smoking have led regulators to impose significant restrictions and high excise taxes on cigarettes 

we support a comprehensive regulatory framework for tobacco products based on the principle of harm reduction including mandated health warnings minimum age laws restrictions on advertising and public place smoking restrictions we also support regulatory measures that help reduce illicit trade 

much of the regulation that shapes the business environment in which we operate is driven by the world health organizations “who” framework convention on tobacco control “fctc” which entered into force in 2005 the fctc has as its main objective to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation with the purpose of reducing tobacco use to date 180 countries and the european union are parties to the fctc the treaty requires parties to have in place various tobacco control measures and recommends others the fctc governing body the conference of the parties “cop” has also adopted nonbinding guidelines and policy recommendations related to certain articles of the fctc that go beyond the text of the treaty in october 2018 the cop recognized the need for more scientific assessment and improved reporting to define policy on heated tobacco products similar to its previous policy recommendations on ecigarettes the cop invited countries to regulate restrict or prohibit heated tobacco products as appropriate under their national laws it is not possible to predict whether or to what extent measures recommended by cop including the fctc guidelines will be implemented 

we continue to seek to engage in a dialogue with regulators with respect to those measures that we do not believe would protect public health and if implemented could disrupt competition severely limit our ability to market and sell our products including our rrps to adult smokers or increase illicit trade we advocate for measures that would accelerate switching to better alternatives to continued smoking and embrace a regulatory framework that recognizes a risk continuum of tobacco and other nicotinecontaining products 

certain measures are discussed in more detail below and in the reducedrisk products rrps  section 

fiscal challenges  excessive and disruptive excise sales and other tax increases and discriminatory tax structures are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on our profitability due to lower consumption and consumer downtrading to nonpremium discount other lowprice or lowtaxed combustible tobacco products such as fine cut tobacco and illicit cigarettes in addition in certain jurisdictions some of our combustible products are subject to tax structures that discriminate against premiumprice products and manufactured cigarettes we believe that such tax policies undermine public health by encouraging consumers to turn to illicit trade and ultimately undercut government revenue objectives disrupt the competitive environment and encourage criminal activity other jurisdictions have imposed or are seeking to impose levies or other taxes specifically on tobacco companies such as taxes on revenues andor profits 

eu tobacco products directive  in april 2014 the eu adopted a significantly revised eu tobacco products directive tpd which entered into force in may 2016 all 28 member states and norway have adopted laws transposing the tpd the tpd sets forth a comprehensive set of regulatory requirements for tobacco products including 

 

plain packaging and other packaging restrictions  plain packaging legislation bans the use of branding logos and colors on packaging other than the brand name and variant that may be printed only in specified locations and in a uniform font to date plain packaging 

 31 

laws have been adopted in certain markets in all of our reporting segments including the key markets of australia france saudi arabia and turkey and are in various degrees of implementation some countries such as new zealand and israel adopted plain packaging regulations that apply to all tobacco products including rrps other countries including canada are also considering plain packaging legislation 

some countries have adopted or are considering adopting packaging restrictions that could have an impact similar to plain packaging examples of such restrictions include standardizing the shape and size of packages prohibiting certain colors or the use of certain descriptive phrases on packaging and requiring very large graphic health warnings that leave little space for branding 

restrictions and bans on the use of ingredients  the who and others in the public health community have recommended restrictions or total bans on the use of some or all ingredients in tobacco products including menthol broad restrictions and ingredient bans would require us to reformulate our american blend tobacco products and could reduce our ability to differentiate these products in the market in the long term menthol bans would eliminate the entire category of mentholated tobacco products the european union has banned flavored tobacco products subject to an exemption until may 2020 for menthol other countries may follow the eu’s approach for instance turkey has banned menthol as of may 2020 broader ingredient bans have been adopted by canada and brazil canada banned menthol in cigarettes as of october 2017 and in all tobacco products as of november 2018 in brazil an ingredient ban is currently on appeal by a tobacco industry union of which our brazilian subsidiary is a member the tobacco union requested a stay of the enforcement of the ingredient ban while the appeal is pending it is not possible to predict the outcome of these legal proceedings 

  

bans on display of tobacco products at retail  in a number of our markets including but not limited to australia canada norway russia and singapore governments have banned the display of tobacco products at the point of sale other countries are considering similar bans 

bans and restrictions on advertising marketing promotions and sponsorships  for many years the fctc has called for and countries have imposed partial or total bans on tobacco advertising marketing promotions and sponsorships including bans and restrictions on advertising on radio and television in print and on the internet the fctcs nonbinding guidelines recommend that governments prohibit all forms of communication with adult smokers 

restrictions on product design   some members of the public health community are calling for the further standardization of tobacco products by requiring for example that cigarettes have a certain minimum diameter which would amount to a ban on slim cigarettes or requiring the use of standardized filter and cigarette paper designs in addition at its meeting in november 2016 the cop adopted nonbinding guidelines recommending that countries regulate product design features that increase the attractiveness of tobacco products such as the diameter of cigarettes and the use of flavor capsules 

restrictions on public smoking  the pace and scope of public smoking restrictions have increased significantly in most of our markets many countries around the world have adopted or are likely to adopt regulations that restrict or ban smoking in public andor work places restaurants bars and nightclubs some public health groups have called for and some countries regional governments and municipalities have adopted or proposed bans on smoking in outdoor places as well as bans on smoking in cars typically when minors are present and private homes 

other regulatory issues  some regulators are considering or in some cases have adopted regulatory measures designed to reduce the supply of tobacco products these include regulations intended to reduce the number of retailers selling tobacco products by for example reducing the overall number of tobacco retail licenses available or banning the sale of tobacco products within specified distances of certain public facilities 

in a limited number of markets most notably japan we are dependent on governmental approvals that may limit our pricing flexibility 

on december 19 2018 the eu council and the eu parliament provisionally agreed on the singleuse plastics directive which would require tobacco manufacturers and importers to cover the costs of public collection systems for cigarette butts the directive is expected to be finalized in the first half of 2019 and subsequently transposed by member states into national law within two years we cannot predict the impact of this initiative on our business at this time 

illicit trade  the illicit tobacco trade creates a cheap and unregulated supply of tobacco products undermines efforts to reduce smoking prevalence especially among youth damages legitimate businesses stimulates organized crime increases corruption and reduces government tax revenue illicit trade may account for as much as 10 of global cigarette consumption this includes counterfeit contraband and the growing problem of “illicit whites” which are cigarettes legally produced in one jurisdiction for the sole purpose of being exported and illegally sold in another jurisdiction where they have no legitimate market we estimate that illicit trade in the european union accounted for approximately 10 of total cigarette consumption in 2018 

 32 

a number of jurisdictions are considering actions to prevent illicit trade in november 2012 the fctc adopted the protocol to eliminate illicit trade in tobacco products the “protocol” which includes supply chain control measures such as licensing of manufacturers and distributors enforcement in free trade zones controls on duty free and internet sales and the implementation of tracking and tracing technologies to date 54 parties have signed the protocol and 48 parties including the european union have ratified it the protocol came into force on september 25 2018 parties must now start implementing its measures via national legislation in october 2018 the first meeting of the parties to the protocol decided to produce a comprehensive report on good practices for the implementation of tracking and tracing systems and to prepare a conceptual framework for global information sharing to combat illicit tobacco trade we welcome this decision and expect that other parties will ratify the protocol 

the tracking and tracing regulations for cigarettes and rollyourown products manufactured or destined for the eu will become effective on may 20 2019 the effective date for other tobaccocontaining products including some of our rrps such as the heated tobacco units used with iqos  is may 20 2024 

in 2009 our colombian subsidiaries entered into an investment and cooperation agreement with the national and regional governments of colombia to promote investment in and cooperation on anticontraband and anticounterfeit efforts the agreement provides 200 million in funding over a 20year period to address issues such as combating the illegal cigarette trade and increasing the quality and quantity of locallygrown tobacco 

in may 2016 pmi launched pmi impact a global initiative that supports thirdparty projects dedicated to fighting illegal trade and related crimes such as corruption organized criminal networks and money laundering the centerpiece of pmi impact is a council of external independent experts in the fields of law anticorruption and law enforcement the experts are responsible for evaluating and approving funding proposals for pmi impact grants pmi has pledged 100 million to fund projects within pmi impact over three funding rounds substantially all grants under the first and second funding round were awarded in 2017 and 2018 respectively 

reducedrisk products rrps   

our approach to rrps   we recognize that smoking cigarettes causes serious diseases and that the best way to avoid the harms of smoking is never to start or to quit nevertheless it is predicted that over the next decade the number of smokers will remain largely unchanged from the current estimate of 11 billion despite the considerable efforts to discourage smoking 

cigarettes burn tobacco which produces smoke as a result of the combustion process the smoker inhales various toxic substances in contrast rrps do not burn tobacco and produce an aerosol that contains significantly lower levels of harmful and potentially harmful constituents hphcs than found in cigarette smoke 

for smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke we believe that rrps while not riskfree offer a much better consumer choice accordingly our key strategic priorities are to develop and commercialize products that present less risk of harm to adult smokers who switch to those products versus continued smoking and to convince current adult smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke to switch to those products 

we recognize that this transformation from cigarettes to rrps will take time and that the speed of transformation will depend in part upon factors beyond our control such as the willingness of governments regulators and other policy groups to embrace rrps as a desired alternative to continued cigarette smoking we also recognize that our part in this transformation must be funded from our existing cigarette business for as long as a significant number of adult smokers continues to smoke it is critical that the industry be led by responsible and ethical manufacturers therefore during the transformation we intend to remain a leading international cigarette manufacturer 

we have a range of rrps in various stages of development scientific assessment and commercialization we conduct rigorous scientific assessments of our rrp platforms to substantiate that they reduce exposure to hphcs and ultimately that these products present are likely to present or have the potential to present less risk of harm to adult smokers who switch to them versus continued smoking we draw upon a team of expert scientists and engineers from a broad spectrum of scientific disciplines and our extensive learnings of adult consumer preferences to develop and assess our rrps our efforts are guided by the following key objectives 

 33 

 

our rrp platforms   our product development is based on the elimination of combustion via tobacco heating and other innovative systems for aerosol generation which we believe is the most promising path to providing a better consumer choice for those who would otherwise continue to smoke we recognize that no single product will appeal to all adult smokers therefore we are developing a portfolio of products intended to appeal to a variety of distinct adult consumer preferences 

four rrp platforms are in various stages of development and commercialization readiness 

  platform 1  uses a precisely controlled heating device that we are commercializing under the iqos  brand name into which a specially designed and proprietary tobacco unit is inserted and heated to generate an aerosol we have conducted a series of clinical studies for this platform the results of which were included in our submission to the us food and drug administration “fda” described below the results of the first sixmonth term of the 66 month exposure response study were received at the end of 2017 and the related report was completed and submitted to the fda in the second quarter of 2018 the study showed that all eight of the coprimary clinical risk endpoints moved in the same direction in the group that switched to iqos  as observed for smoking cessation with statistically significant changes in five of the eight endpoints compared with ongoing smoking the results of the second sixmonth term of the 66 month exposure response study were received for analysis in the second quarter of 2018 the related report is under preparation in addition as set out in our submission to the fda referenced above we completed an 18month combined chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity study in mice which was ongoing at the time of our fda submission we shared the results with the fda in august 2018 

  platform 2  uses a pressed carbon heat source which when ignited generates a nicotinecontaining aerosol by heating tobacco the results of our pharmacokinetic study that measured the nicotine pharmacokinetic profile as well as subjective effects and of our fiveday reduced exposure study indicate that this platform could be an acceptable substitute for adult smokers who seek an alternative to cigarettes the reduced exposure study results showed a substantial reduction in relevant biomarkers of exposure to the measured hphcs in those who switched to platform 2 compared to those who continued to smoke cigarettes over a fiveday period the sustainability of this reduction as well as changes in clinical risk markers were assessed in a threemonth reduced exposure study the results of this study were received at the end of 2017 and the related report was finalized in the second quarter of 2018 

  platform 3  provides an aerosol of nicotine salt formed by the chemical reaction of nicotine with a weak organic acid we have explored two routes for this platform one with electronics and one without and conducted nicotine pharmacokinetic studies with both versions the results of the pharmacokinetic study related to the version without electronics were received and the related report was finalized in the fourth quarter of 2018 the results indicate this products potential as an acceptable alternative to continued cigarette smoking in terms of product satisfaction we will also initiate a clinical product use and adaptation study 

  platform 4  covers evapor products which are batterypowered devices that produce an aerosol by vaporizing a nicotinecontaining liquid solution our evapor products comprise devices using current generation technology and our new evapor mesh technology that addresses certain challenges presented by some evapor products currently on the market our iqos   mesh products are designed to ensure the consistency and quality of the generated aerosol we conducted a nicotine pharmacokinetic study in 2017 the results of this study were received in the second quarter of 2018 for analysis and the related report was finalized in the fourth quarter of 2018 the results of this study indicate that iqos mesh  products are an effective means of nicotine delivery while being a satisfying alternative for ecigarette users we will also initiate a clinical reduced exposure study to measure selected biomarkers of exposure to hphcs and assess changes in clinical risk markers 

after we receive the results of our scientific studies mentioned above in accordance with standard scientific practices we intend to share the conclusions in scientific forums and to submit them for inclusion in peerreviewed publications 

 34 

the research and development expense for our rrp portfolio accounted for 92 74 and 72 of our total research and development expense for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively the research and development expense for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 is set forth in item 8 note 14 additional information  to the consolidated financial statements 

commercialization of rrps   we are building a new product category and tailor our commercialization strategy to the characteristics of each specific market we focus our commercialization efforts on consumer retail experience guided consumer trials and customer care as well as digital communication programs in order to accelerate switching to iqos  our initial market introductions typically entail oneonone consumer engagement and introductory device discounts these initial commercialization efforts require substantial investment which we believe will moderate over time 

in 2014 we introduced the iqos  heated tobacco system in pilot city launches in nagoya japan and in milan italy since then we have continuously expanded our commercialization activities and iqos is currently available for sale in 44 markets in key cities or nationwide 

in japan we observed a slowerthaninitiallyprojected growth in the first half of 2018 as we are now reaching different socioeconomic strata with more conservative consumers who show a slower pace of adoption than early adopters in late 2018 we began implementing a number of initiatives intended to specifically address the needs of these adult smokers 

we estimate that while some iqos  users are experimenting with competitive products only a very small percentage of converted  iqos users in japan switch to those products 

  

we estimate that only a very small percentage of adult smokers who convert to iqos  switch back to cigarettes 

we have been integrating the production of our heated tobacco units into a number of our existing manufacturing facilities and progressing with our plans to build manufacturing capacity for our other rrp platforms 

an adequate supply chain for our rrp portfolio including the supply of electronic devices is important to our business we work with two electronics manufacturing service providers for the supply of our iqos  devices and a small number of other providers for other products in our rrp portfolio and related accessories although we work closely with these service providers on monitoring their production capability and financial health the commercialization of our rrps could be adversely affected if they are unable to meet their commitments the production of our rrp portfolio requires various metals and we believe that there is an adequate supply of such metals in the world markets to satisfy our current and anticipated production requirements however some components and materials necessary for the production of our rrps including those for the electronic devices are obtained from single or limited sources and can be subject to industrywide shortages and price fluctuations our inability to secure an adequate supply of such components and materials could negatively impact the commercialization of our rrps 

our iqos  devices are subject to standard product warranties generally for a period of 12 months from the date of purchase or such other periods as required by law we discuss product warranties in more detail in note 5 product warranty  the significance of warranty claims is dependent on a number of factors including warranty policies and product failure rates and may increase with the number of devices sold 

our commercialization efforts for the other rrp platforms are as follows 

 

 

 

rrp regulation and taxation  rrps contain nicotine and are not riskfree we therefore support sciencebased regulation and taxation of rrps regulation and taxation should differentiate between cigarettes and products that present are likely to present or have the potential to present less risk of harm to adult smokers who switch to these products versus continued smoking and recognize a continuum of risk for tobacco and other nicotinecontaining products regulation should provide minimum standards for rrps and specific rules for product assessment methodologies ingredients labelling and consumer communication and should ensure that the public is informed about the health risks of all combustible and noncombustible tobacco and nicotinecontaining products regulation as well as industry practices should reflect the fact that youth should not consume nicotine in any form 

 35 

some governments have banned or are seeking to ban or severely restrict emerging tobacco and nicotinecontaining products such as our rrps and communication of truthful and nonmisleading information about such products these regulations might foreclose or unreasonably restrict adult consumer access even to products that might be shown to be a better consumer choice than continuing to smoke we oppose such blanket bans and unreasonable restrictions of products that have the potential to present less risk of harm compared to continued smoking by contrast we support regulation that sets clear standards and propels innovation to benefit adult smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke 

in the united states an established regulatory framework for assessing “modified risk tobacco products” and “new tobacco products” exists under the jurisdiction of the fda we submitted to the fda a modified risk tobacco product application “mrtpa” for iqos  in december 2016 and a premarket tobacco product application “pmta” for iqos  in march 2017 in may 2017 the fda formally accepted and filed our mrtpa for substantive scientific review and in june 2017 the fda opened the period for the public to provide comments on our application the fda recently announced the public comment period would close on february 11 2019 in august 2017 the fda completed a preliminary review of our pmta and accepted our application for substantive review the fda referred our mrtpa to the tobacco product scientific advisory committee “tpsac” tpsac held a meeting on january 24 and january 25 2018 to discuss our mrtpa the recommendations and votes of tpsac are not binding on the fda by regulation the fda’s decision on our mrtpa will take into account in addition to the views of tpsac scientific evidence as well as comments data and information submitted by interested persons 

separately in july 2017 the fda issued a policy announcement aiming to explore the potential of nicotine reduction in cigarettes in conjunction with the availability of less harmful products that deliver nicotine for adults who choose to use such products in july 2018 as part of a public consultation procedure we submitted our views on this topic to the fda 

following a rise in the use of evapor products among minors in the us in november 2018 the fda announced a policy framework for the prevention of the use of tobacco and nicotinecontaining products by youth under the policy framework flavored evapor products other than tobacco mint and menthol flavors may be sold only in agerestricted retail outlets or through online sites with heightened age verification requirements the fda also announced its intention to remove from the market certain evapor products that are appealing or marketed to youth while we do not sell products in the us and therefore are not subject to these actions we continue to support regulation and industry practices that reflect the fact that youth should not consume nicotine in any form 

future fda actions may influence the regulatory approach of other governments 

until recently there were no countries with specific product standards for heated tobacco products effective july 2017 and march 2018 respectively russia and ukraine adopted standards that set minimum quality and safety requirements for the consumables and defined methods for demonstrating the absence of combustion and the product standards in kazakhstan that come into force in march 2019 also cover devices we expect and encourage other governments to consider similar product standards going forward 

in the eu all eu member states and norway have transposed the eu tobacco products directive including the provisions on novel tobacco products such as heated tobacco units and ecigarettes most of the eu member states require a notification submitted six months before the intended placing on the market of a novel tobacco product while some require premarket authorizations for the introduction of such products to date we have filed a comprehensive dossier summarizing our scientific assessment of iqos  in 22 member states 

in addition in italy in april 2018 we submitted under recent legislation an application for heets  used with the iqos  device requesting regulatory recognition of the reduction of toxic substances and potential risk reduction resulting from switching to this product compared to continued cigarette smoking in january 2019 our application was not granted primarily on the grounds of insufficient data and questions of methodology due to the constraints of the review process we had been unable to supplement the application with all the data we subsequently filed with the fda and to address methodological questions during the review we plan to submit a new application where we will clarify the concerns raised by the decision and further strengthen our application by submitting additional evidence that became available since we submitted our first application consistent with our fda filing we are confident that our evidence supports our application 

 also pursuant to local regulations in may 2018 we submitted a scientific dossier to regulatory authorities in bulgaria with the notification of our intent to communicate to adult smokers the reduction of measured hphcs and potential risk reduction resulting from switching to iqos  compared to continued cigarette smoking 

to date several governmental agencies published their scientific findings that pertain to our rrps 

 36 

on december 12 2017 at the request of the uk department of health and public health england the uk committee on toxicity published its assessment of the risk of heated tobacco products relative to cigarette smoking this assessment included analysis of scientific data for two heated tobacco products one of which was iqos  the assessment concluded that while still harmful to health compared with the known risks from cigarettes heated tobacco products are probably less harmful subsequently on february 6 2018 public health england published a report stating that the available evidence suggests that heated tobacco products may be considerably less harmful than cigarettes and more harmful than ecigarettes 

on may 5 2018 the german federal institute for risk assessment “bfr” published a study on the iqos  aerosol relative to cigarette smoke using the health canada intense smoking regimen bfr found reductions in selected hphcs in a range of 8099 this publication indicates that significant reductions in the levels of selected toxicants are likely to reduce toxicant exposure which bfr stated might be regarded as a discrete benefit compared to combustible cigarettes 

on may 15 2018 the dutch national institute for public health and environment “rivm” published a factsheet on novel tobacco products that heat rather than burn tobacco focusing on iqos  rivm analyzed the iqos  aerosol and concluded that the use of heated tobacco units with iqos  while still harmful to health is probably less harmful than continued smoking 

on june 7 2018 the korean food and drug administration “kfda” issued a statement on products that heat rather than burn tobacco the kfda tested three heatnotburn products one of which was iqos  the kfda confirmed that the levels of the nine hphcs tested in the aerosol of these products were on average approximately 90 lower compared to those measured in the cigarette smoke of the top five cigarette brands in south korea however the kfda stated that it could not establish that the tested heatnotburn products are less harmful than cigarettes in october 2018 our korean affiliate filed a request with a local court seeking information underlying kfda’s analysis conclusions and public statements 

on august 17 2018 the science  technology committee of the uk house of commons published a report of its inquiry into ecigarettes and heatnotburn tobacco products the report concluded that ecigarettes are significantly less harmful to health than smoking tobacco the report also observed that for those smokers who don’t accept ecigarettes heatnotburn tobacco products may offer a public health benefit despite their relative risk the report called for a riskproportionate regulatory environment for both ecigarettes and heatnotburn tobacco products and noted that ecigarettes should remain the least taxed cigarettes the most taxed with heatnotburn products falling between the two the uk committee on advertising practice announced the removal of a prohibition of health claims in the advertising of ecigarettes in the uk effective november 2018 with a review of the impact of this decision on market practices 12 months thereafter 

we make our scientific findings publicly available for scrutiny and peer review through several channels including our websites from time to time adult consumers competitors members of the scientific community and others inquire into our scientific methodologies challenge our scientific conclusions or request further study of certain aspects of our rrps and their health effects we are committed to a robust and open scientific debate but believe that such debate should be based on accurate and reliable scientific information we seek to provide accurate and reliable scientific information about our rrps nonetheless we may not be able to prevent thirdparty dissemination of false misleading or unsubstantiated information about these products the dissemination of scientifically unsubstantiated information or studies with a strong confirmation bias by third parties may cause confusion among adult smokers and affect their decision to switch to better alternatives to continued smoking such as our rrps 

to date we have been largely successful in demonstrating to regulators that our rrps are not cigarettes due to the absence of combustion and as such they are generally taxed either as a separate category or as other tobacco products which typically yields more favorable tax rates than cigarettes although we believe that this is sensible from the public health perspective we cannot guarantee that regulators will continue this approach 

there can be no assurance that we will succeed in our efforts to replace cigarettes with rrps or that regulation will allow us to commercialize rrps in all markets to communicate scientifically substantiated riskreduction claims or to treat rrps differently from cigarettes 

legal challenges to rrps  we face various administrative and legal challenges related to certain rrp activities including allegations concerning product classification advertising restrictions corporate communications iqos  coach activities scientific substantiation product liability and unfair competition while we design our programs to comply with relevant regulations we expect these or similar challenges to continue as we expand our efforts to commercialize rrps and to communicate publicly the outcomes of these matters may affect our rrp commercialization and public communication activities and performance in one or more countries 

our rrp business development initiatives   in december 2013 we established a strategic framework with altria group inc “altria” setting out terms on how the parties would collaborate to develop and commercialize evapor products and commercialize two of our rrps in the us in late 2018 altria announced that it will participate in the evapor category only through another evapor company in 

 37 

which altria has agreed to acquire a minority interest we intend to hold discussions with altria about evapor products following completion of its investment regarding heated tobacco products as discussed above we are seeking regulatory approval from the fda to market iqos  in the us and these efforts are not affected by altrias evapor announcement 

other developments  on september 12 2017 we announced our support of the foundation for a smokefree world we agreed to contribute 80 million per year over the next 12 years as specified in the agreement we made an initial contribution of 45 million in 2017 the first annual contribution of 80 million in the first quarter of 2018 and the second annual contribution of 80 million in the first quarter of 2019 the foundation is an independent body and is governed by its independent board of directors the foundation’s role as set out in its corporate charter includes funding research in the field of tobacco harm reduction encouraging measures that reduce the harm caused by smoking and assessing the effect of reduced cigarette consumption on the industry value chain 

governmental investigations 

from time to time we are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters including tax customs antitrust advertising and labor practices we describe certain matters pending in thailand and south korea in item 8 note 18 contingencies  

in november 2010 a wto panel issued its decision in a dispute relating to facts that arose from august 2006 between the philippines and thailand concerning a series of thai customs and tax measures affecting cigarettes imported by pm thailand into thailand see item 8 note 18 contingencies for additional information the wto panel decision which was upheld by the wto appellate body concluded that thailand had no basis to find that pm thailands declared customs values and taxes paid were too low as alleged by the dsi in 2009 the decision also created obligations for thailand to revise its laws regulations or practices affecting the customs valuation and tax treatment of future cigarette imports thailand agreed in september 2011 to fully comply with the decision by october 2012 the philippines asserts that to date thailand has not fully complied with the wto panel decision the philippines has repeatedly expressed concerns with ongoing investigations by thailand of pm thailand including those that led to the criminal charges described in item 8 note 18 contingencies  and has commenced two formal proceedings at the wto to challenge criminal charges against pm thailand arguing that the criminal charges appear to be based on grounds not supported by wto customs valuation rules and inconsistent with several decisions already taken by thai customs and other thai governmental agencies the philippines has also asserted that the demand notices received by pm thailand from the thai customs department in november 2017 described in note 8 contingencies  are inconsistent with thailands wto obligations on november 12 2018 the wto issued its decision agreeing with the philippines that criminal charges against pm thailand and seven former and current employees   in connection with import entries of cigarettes from the philippines during the period of july 2003 to june 2006 are inconsistent with wto customs valuation rules in january 2019 thailand appealed this decision 

us gaap treatment of argentina as a highly inflationary economy 

following the categorization of argentina by the international practices task force of the center for audit quality as a country with a threeyear cumulative inflation rate greater than 100 the country is considered highly inflationary in accordance with us gaap consequently we began to account for the operations of our argentinian affiliates as highly inflationary and to treat the us dollar as the functional currency of the affiliates effective july 1 2018 the move to highly inflationary accounting in argentina reduced our currencyneutral net revenue growth by approximately 06 points in 2018

we discuss our investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries and equity securities in item 8 note 4 investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries   and other related party  and item 8 note 16 fair value measurements  to our consolidated financial statements 

trade policy 

we are subject to various trade restrictions imposed by the united states of america and countries in which we do business “trade sanctions” including the trade and economic sanctions administered by the us department of the treasurys office of foreign assets control and the us department of state it is our policy to comply fully with these trade sanctions 

 38 

tobacco products are agricultural products under us law and are not technological or strategic in nature from time to time we make sales in countries subject to trade sanctions either where such sanctions do not apply to our business or pursuant to exemptions or licenses 

to our knowledge none of our commercial arrangements results in the governments of any country identified by the us government as a state sponsor of terrorism nor entities controlled by those governments receiving cash or acting as intermediaries in violation of us laws 

we do not sell products in iran sudan north korea and syria from time to time we explore opportunities to sell our products in one or more of these countries as permitted by law 

certain states within the us have enacted legislation permitting state pension funds to divest or abstain from future investment in stocks of companies that do business with certain countries that are sanctioned by the us we do not believe such legislation has had a material effect on the price of our shares

financial review 

Ÿ net cash provided by operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities of 95 billion  for the year ended december 31 2018  increased  by 06 billion  from the comparable 2017  period excluding the 2017 cash flow movements resulting from the tax cuts and jobs act as described below as well as unfavorable currency movements of 02 billion the increase in cash flows provided by operating activities was attributable to higher net earnings and the 2017 payment in the south korean tax matter see item 8 note 18 contingencies  for additional information partially offset by other movements 

the variance in our working capital movements was essentially flat excluding the 2017 movements related to the tax cuts and jobs act as the positive impact of timing of receivables collections and the timing of inventory movements and related excise tax payments were largely offset by the transition tax installment payments in 2018 of 02 billion and cash used for accounts payable in 2018 reflecting higher iqos  device purchases in the fourth quarter of 2017 

 50 

net cash provided by operating activities of 89 billion for the year ended december 31 2017 increased by 08 billion from the comparable 2016 period while the impacts of the tax cuts and jobs act reduced net earnings by 16 billion there was no net impact on operating cash flows for the year as the changes in deferred taxes and income taxes payable offset the net earnings impact excluding the impact of the tax cuts and jobs act as well as favorable currency movements of 04 billion the increase in cash flows provided by operating activities can be attributed to higher net earnings offset by working capital and other movements 

at december 31 2017 pmi recorded an income tax payable of 17 billion representing the transition tax of 22 billion partially offset by foreign tax credits related to foreign withholding taxes previously paid of 05 billion the income tax payable is due over an 8year period beginning in 2018 for further details see item 8 note 11 income taxes  to our consolidated financial statements 

Ÿ net cash used in investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities of 10 billion  for the year ended december 31 2018  decreased  by 21 billion  from the comparable 2017  period this decrease  was due principally to lower cash collateral posted to secure derivatives designated as net investment hedges of euro assets principally related to changes in exchange rates between the euro and the us dollar and lower capital expenditures for further details on our derivatives designated as net investment hedges see item 8 note 15 financial instruments  

net cash used in investing activities of 31 billion  for the year ended december 31 2017 increased by 22 billion  from the comparable 2016 period this increase in net cash used of 22 billion  was due principally to cash collateral posted to secure derivatives designated as net investment hedges of euro assets following the strengthening of the euro versus the us dollar and higher capital expenditures for further details on our derivatives designated as net investment hedges see item 8 note 15 financial instruments  

our capital expenditures were 14 billion  in 2018  15 billion  in 2017  and 12 billion  in 2016  the 2018  expenditures were primarily related to our ongoing investments in rrps to support capacity expansion notably for heated tobacco units we expect total capital expenditures in 2019  of approximately 11 billion including capital expenditures related to our ongoing investment in rrps to be funded by operating cash flows 

Ÿ net cash used in financing activities 

during 2018  net cash used in financing activities was 97 billion  compared with net cash used in financing activities of 28 billion  during 2017  and 54 billion  in 2016  

the 2018   change was due primarily to lower proceeds from longterm debt issuances primarily the 69 billion proceeds in 2017 from our us dollar and euro debt issuances and the purchase of the remaining 49 interest in our costa rican affiliates in 2018 for further details on the purchase of the remaining 49 interest in our costa rican affiliates see item 8 note 6 acquisitions  

the 2017 change was due primarily to higher proceeds from longterm debt issuances primarily the 69 billion proceeds in 2017 from our us dollar and euro debt issuances versus the 35 billion proceeds in 2016 from our us dollar and euro debt issuances 

dividends paid in 2018  2017  and 2016  were 69 billion  65 billion  and 64 billion  respectively 

Ÿ debt and liquidity 

we define cash and cash equivalents as shortterm highly liquid investments readily convertible to known amounts of cash that mature within a maximum of three months and have an insignificant risk of change in value due to interest rate or credit risk changes as a policy we do not hold any investments in structured or equitylinked products our cash and cash equivalents are predominantly held in demand deposits with institutions that have investmentgrade longterm credit rating as part of our cash management strategy and in order to manage counterparty exposure we also enter into reverse repurchase agreements such agreements are collateralized with government or corporate securities held by a custodial bank and at maturity cash is paid back to pmi and the collateral is returned to the bank while we entered into these agreements during the periods and had an average balance during 2018  and 2017  of 03 billion  and 09 billion  respectively we had a zero balance both at december 31 2018  and december 31 2017  

we utilize longterm and shortterm debt financing including a commercial paper program that is regularly used to finance ongoing liquidity requirements as part of our overall cash management strategy our ability to access the capital and credit markets as well as overall dynamics of these markets may impact borrowing costs we expect that the combination of our longterm and shortterm debt financing the commercial paper program and the committed credit facilities coupled with our operating cash flows will enable us to meet our liquidity requirements

credit ratings  – the cost and terms of our financing arrangements as well as our access to commercial paper markets may be affected by applicable credit ratings on march 1 2018 standard  poors affirmed our longterm credit rating at a and shortterm at a1 and revised our outlook to stable from negative on august 3 2018 fitch affirmed our longterm credit rating at a and shortterm at f1 and revised our outlook to stable from negative at february 7 2019 our credit ratings and outlook by major credit rating agencies were as follows 



credit facilities  –   on january 28 2019 we entered into an agreement to extend the term of our 20 billion 364day revolving credit facility from february 5 2019 to february 4 2020 

  

at february 7 2019 our committed credit facilities were as follows 



at february 7 2019 there were no borrowings under the committed credit facilities and the entire committed amounts were available for borrowing 

all banks participating in our committed credit facilities have an investmentgrade longterm credit rating from the credit rating agencies we continuously monitor the credit quality of our banking group and at this time we are not aware of any potential nonperforming credit provider 

each of these facilities requires us to maintain a ratio of consolidated earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “consolidated ebitda” to consolidated interest expense of not less than 35 to 10 on a rolling fourquarter basis at december 31 2018  our ratio calculated in accordance with the agreements was 105  to 10 these facilities do not include any credit rating triggers material adverse change clauses or any provisions that could require us to post collateral we expect to continue to meet our covenants the terms “consolidated ebitda” and “consolidated interest expense” both of which include certain adjustments are defined in the facility agreements previously filed with the us securities and exchange commission 

in addition to the committed credit facilities discussed above certain of our subsidiaries maintain shortterm credit arrangements to meet their respective working capital needs these credit arrangements which amounted to approximately 33 billion  at december 31 2018  and 28 billion  at december 31 2017  are for the sole use of our subsidiaries borrowings under these arrangements amounted to 730 million  at december 31 2018  and 499 million  at december 31 2017  

commercial paper program –  we continue to have access to liquidity in the commercial paper market through programs in place in the us and in europe having an aggregate issuance capacity of 80 billion at december 31 2018  and december 31 2017  we had no commercial paper outstanding the average commercial paper balance outstanding during 2018  and 2017   was 34 billion  and 52 billion  respectively 

sale of accounts receivable  –  to mitigate credit risk and enhance cash and liquidity management we sell trade receivables to unaffiliated financial institutions these arrangements allow us to sell on an ongoing basis certain trade receivables without recourse the trade receivables sold are generally shortterm in nature and are removed from the consolidated balance sheets we sell trade receivables under two types of arrangements servicing and nonservicing 

 52 

our operating cash flows were positively impacted by the amount of the trade receivables sold and derecognized from the consolidated balance sheets which remained outstanding with the unaffiliated financial institutions the trade receivables sold that remained outstanding under these arrangements as of december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  were 10 billion  11 billion  and 07 billion  respectively the net proceeds received are included in cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows

on february 14 2017 we filed a shelf registration statement with the us securities and exchange commission under which we may from time to time sell debt securities andor warrants to purchase debt securities over a threeyear period 

during 2018  we had no public debt issuances 



the weightedaverage time to maturity of our longterm debt was 96 years at the end of 2018  and 94 years at the end of 2017  

 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements including special purpose entities other than guarantees and contractual obligations discussed below 

guarantees  –  at december 31 2018  we were contingently liable for 03 billion of guarantees of our own performance which were primarily related to excise taxes on the shipment of our products there is no liability in the consolidated financial statements associated with these guarantees at december 31 2018  our thirdparty guarantees were insignificant 

 53 

aggregate contractual obligations  –  the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2018  



1  amounts represent the expected cash payments at the face value of our longterm debt and capital lease obligations for further details see item 8 note 7 indebtedness  to our consolidated financial statements

3  amounts represent the minimum rental commitments under noncancelable operating leases 

4  purchase obligations for inventory and production costs such as raw materials indirect materials and supplies packaging comanufacturing arrangements storage and distribution are commitments for projected needs to be utilized in the normal course of business other purchase obligations include commitments for marketing advertising capital expenditures information technology and professional services other purchase obligations also include the expected future contributions to the foundation for a smokefree world for further details see business environment — other developments  arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction amounts represent the minimum commitments under noncancelable contracts any amounts reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as accounts payable and accrued liabilities are excluded from the table above 

5  other longterm liabilities consist primarily of transition tax as discussed in item 8 note 11 income taxes to our consolidated financial statements postretirement health care costs and accruals established for employment costs the following longterm liabilities included on the consolidated balance sheet are excluded from the table above accrued pension and postemployment costs tax contingencies insurance accruals and other accruals we are unable to estimate the timing of payments or contributions in the case of accrued pension costs for these items currently we anticipate making pension contributions of approximately 119 million  in 2019  based on current tax and benefit laws as discussed in item 8 note 13 benefit plans  to our consolidated financial statements 

Ÿ equity and dividends 

we discuss our stock awards as of december 31 2018  in item 8 note 9 stock plans to our consolidated financial statements 

during 2018  2017  and 2016  we did not repurchase any shares under a share repurchase program and we do not presently intend to repurchase shares of our common stock in 2019  

dividends paid in 2018  were 69 billion  during the second quarter of 2018 our board of directors approved a 65 increase in the quarterly dividend to 114 per common share as a result the present annualized dividend rate is 456 per common share 

market risk 

Ÿ counterparty risk    we predominantly work with financial institutions with strong short and longterm credit ratings as assigned by standard  poor’s and moody’s these banks are also part of a defined group of relationship banks noninvestment grade institutions are only used in certain emerging markets to the extent required by local business needs we have a conservative approach when it comes to choosing financial counterparties and financial instruments as such we do not invest or hold investments in any structured or equitylinked products the majority of our cash and cash equivalents is currently invested in demand deposits maturing within less than 30 days 

we continuously monitor and assess the credit worthiness of all our counterparties 

 54 

Ÿ derivative financial instruments   we operate in markets outside of the us with manufacturing and sales facilities in various locations throughout the world consequently we use certain financial instruments to manage our foreign currency and interest rate exposure we use derivative financial instruments principally to reduce our exposure to market risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates by creating offsetting exposures we are not a party to leveraged derivatives and by policy do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 

see item 8 note 15 financial instruments  item 8 note 16 fair value measurements  and item 8 note 19 balance sheet offsetting  to our consolidated financial statements for further details on our derivative financial instruments and the related collateral arrangements 

Ÿ value at risk    we use a value at risk computation to estimate the potential oneday loss in the fair value of our interestratesensitive financial instruments and to estimate the potential oneday loss in pretax earnings of our foreign currency pricesensitive derivative financial instruments this computation includes our debt shortterm investments and foreign currency forwards swaps and options anticipated transactions foreign currency trade payables and receivables and net investments in foreign subsidiaries which the foregoing instruments are intended to hedge were excluded from the computation 

the computation estimates were made assuming normal market conditions using a 95 confidence interval we use a “variancecovariance” model to determine the observed interrelationships between movements in interest rates and various currencies these interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate and forward currency rate movements over the preceding quarter for determining value at risk at december 31 2018  and 2017  and over each of the four preceding quarters for the calculation of average value at risk amounts during each year the values of foreign currency options do not change on a onetoone basis with the underlying currency and were valued accordingly in the computation 

the estimated potential oneday loss in fair value of our interestratesensitive instruments primarily debt under normal market conditions and the estimated potential oneday loss in pretax earnings from foreign currency instruments under normal market conditions as calculated in the value at risk model were as follows 



the value at risk computation is a risk analysis tool designed to statistically estimate the maximum probable daily loss from adverse movements in interest and foreign currency rates under normal market conditions the computation does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value or earnings to be incurred by us nor does it consider the effect of favorable changes in market rates we cannot predict 

 55 

actual future movements in such market rates and do not present these results to be indicative of future movements in market rates or to be representative of any actual impact that future changes in market rates may have on our future results of operations or financial position 

contingencies 

see item 3 and item 8 note 18 contingencies  to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of contingencies 

cautionary factors that may affect future results 

forwardlooking and cautionary statements 

we may from time to time make written or oral forwardlooking statements including statements contained in filings with the sec in reports to stockholders and in press releases and investor webcasts you can identify these forwardlooking statements by use of words such as strategy expects continues plans anticipates believes will estimates intends projects goals targets and other words of similar meaning you can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 

we cannot guarantee that any forwardlooking statement will be realized although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions our rrps constitute a new product category in its early stages that is less predictable than our mature cigarette business achievement of future results is subject to risks uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate actual results could vary materially from those anticipated estimated or projected investors should bear this in mind as they consider forwardlooking statements and whether to invest in or remain invested in our securities in connection with the “safe harbor” provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 we are identifying important factors that individually or in the aggregate could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements made by us any such statement is qualified by reference to the following cautionary statements we elaborate on these and other risks we face throughout this document particularly in item 1a risk factors and business environment  of this section you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors consequently you should not consider this discussion of potential risks or uncertainties to be complete we do not undertake to update any forwardlooking statement that we may make from time to time except in the normal course of our public disclosure obligations

a general development of business 

  

general 

  

philip morris international inc is a virginia holding company incorporated in 1987 our subsidiaries and affiliates and their licensees are engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes and other nicotinecontaining products in markets outside of the united states of america we are building our future on smokefree products that are a much better consumer choice than continuing to smoke cigarettes through multidisciplinary capabilities in product development stateoftheart facilities and scientific substantiation we aim to ensure that our smokefree products meet adult consumer preferences and rigorous regulatory requirements our vision is that these products ultimately replace cigarettes to the benefit of adult smokers society our company and our shareholders 

our cigarettes are sold in more than 180 markets and in many of these markets they hold the number one or number two market share position we have a wide range of premium midprice and lowprice brands our portfolio comprises both international and local brands and is led by marlboro  the world’s bestselling international cigarette which accounted for approximately 35  of our total 2017  cigarette shipment volume marlboro  is complemented in the premiumprice category by parliament  our other leading international cigarette brands are bond street chesterfield lm   lark and philip morris these   seven international cigarette brands contributed approximately 75  of our cigarette shipment volume in 2017  we also own a number of important local cigarette brands such as dji sam soe   sampoerna   a  and sampoerna   u in indonesia fortune and  jackpot  in the philippines belmont and  canadian classics  in canada and delicados  in mexico while there are a number of markets where local brands remain important international brands are expanding their share in numerous markets 

in addition to our leading cigarette brand portfolio we are engaged in the development and commercialization of smokefree alternatives to cigarettes reducedrisk products rrps is the term we use to refer to products that present are likely to present or have the potential to present less risk of harm to smokers who switch to these products versus continued smoking we have a range of rrps in various stages of development scientific assessment and commercialization because our rrps do not burn tobacco they produce an aerosol that contains far lower quantities of harmful and potentially harmful constituents than found in cigarette smoke 

our leading rrp brand iqos    is a precisely controlled device into which a specially designed heated tobacco unit is inserted and heated to generate an aerosol we market our heated tobacco units under the brand names heets   heets marlboro and heets from marlboro  defined collectively as heets  as well as marlboro   heatsticks and  parliament heatsticks  iqos  was first introduced in nagoya japan in 2014 to date iqos  is available for sale in key cities in 37 markets and nationwide in japan 

source of funds — dividends 

  

we are a legal entity separate and distinct from our direct and indirect subsidiaries accordingly our right and thus the right of our creditors and stockholders to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of any subsidiary is subject to the prior rights of creditors of such subsidiary except to the extent that claims of our company itself as a creditor may be recognized as a holding company our principal sources of funds including funds to make payment on our debt securities are from the receipt of dividends and repayment of debt from our subsidiaries our principal whollyowned and majorityowned subsidiaries currently are not limited by longterm debt or other agreements in their ability to pay cash dividends or to make other distributions with respect to their common stock 

b financial information about segments 

  

for all periods presented in this report we divided our markets into four geographic regions which constitute our segments for financial reporting purposes 

  



 1 

 

net revenues and operating companies income   together with a reconciliation to operating income attributable to each segment for each of the last three years are set forth in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10k item 8 in note 12 segment reporting  to the consolidated financial statements see item 7 of this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of our operating results by business segment 

  

the relative percentages of operating companies income attributable to each reportable segment were as follows 

  



 

 

we use the term net revenues to refer to our operating revenues from the sale of our products net of sales and promotion incentives our net revenues and operating income are affected by various factors including the volume of products we sell the price of our products changes in currency exchange rates and the mix of products we sell mix is a term used to refer to the proportionate value of premiumprice brands to midprice or lowprice brands in any given market product mix mix can also refer to the proportion of shipment volume in more profitable markets versus shipment volume in less profitable markets geographic mix we often collect excise taxes from our customers and then remit them to local governments and in those circumstances we include excise taxes in our net revenues and excise taxes on products our cost of sales consists principally of tobacco leaf nontobacco raw materials labor and manufacturing costs as well as the cost of the iqos  devices produced by thirdparty electronics manufacturing service providers 

our marketing administration and research costs include the costs of marketing and selling our products other costs generally not related to the manufacture of our products including general corporate expenses and costs incurred to develop new products the most significant components of our marketing administration and research costs are marketing and sales expenses and general and administrative expenses 

  

to provide a greater focus on both parts of our business  combustible and reducedrisk products  and to support our transformation toward a smokefree future effective january 1 2018 we began managing our business in six reportable segments as follows 

 

 2 

c narrative description of business 

  

our total shipments including cigarettes and heated tobacco units decreased  by 27  in 2017  to 7982 billion  units we estimate that international industry volumes including cigarettes and heated tobacco units were approximately 52 trillion  units in 2017  a 13   decrease  over 2016  excluding the people’s republic of china “prc” we estimate that the international cigarette and heated tobacco unit volume was 28 trillion  units in 2017  a 28   decrease  over 2016  we estimate that our reported share of the international market which is defined as worldwide cigarette and heated tobacco unit volume excluding the united states of america was approximately 152  in 2017  155  in 2016  and 156  in 2015  excluding the prc we estimate that our reported share of the international market was approximately 280  281  and 286  in 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively 

  

shipments of our principal cigarette brand marlboro  decreased  by 40  in 2017  and represented approximately 97  of the international cigarette market excluding the prc in 2017  96  in 2016  and 96  in 2015  

  

we have a market share of at least 15 and in a number of instances substantially more than 15 in approximately 100 markets including algeria argentina australia austria belgium brazil canada the czech republic egypt france germany hong kong indonesia israel italy japan korea kuwait mexico the netherlands norway the philippines poland portugal russia saudi arabia spain singapore switzerland turkey and ukraine 

  

heated tobacco units is the term we use to refer to heated tobacco consumables which include our heets   heets marlboro and heets from marlboro  defined collectively as heets  as well as marlboro   heatsticks and  parliament heatsticks total shipment volume of heated tobacco units reached 362 billion  units in 2017  up from 74 billion  units in 2016  

references to total international market defined as worldwide cigarette and heated tobacco unit volume excluding the united states total industry total market and market shares in this form 10k are our estimates for taxpaid products based on the latest available data from a number of internal and external sources 

distribution  sales 

our main types of distribution are tailored to the characteristics of each market and are often used simultaneously 

  

   

competition 

  

we are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business we compete primarily on the basis of product quality brand recognition brand loyalty taste rd innovation packaging customer service marketing advertising and retail price and increasingly adult smoker willingness to convert to our rrps our competitors include three large international tobacco companies and several regional and local tobacco companies and in some instances stateowned tobacco enterprises principally in algeria egypt the prc taiwan thailand and vietnam industry consolidation and privatizations of stateowned enterprises have led to an overall increase in competitive pressures some competitors have different profit and volume objectives and some international competitors are susceptible to changes in currency exchange rates in the combustible product category we predominantly sell american blend cigarette brands such as marlboro  lm   parliament philip morris  and chesterfield  which are the most popular across many of our markets in the rrp product category we predominantly sell iqos  devices and heated tobacco units we seek to compete in all profitable retail price categories although our brand portfolio is weighted towards the premiumprice category 

 3 

  procurement and raw materials 

  

we purchase tobacco leaf of various types grades and styles throughout the world mostly through independent tobacco suppliers we also contract directly with farmers in several countries including argentina brazil colombia ecuador italy kazakhstan pakistan the philippines and poland in 2017 direct sourcing from farmers represented approximately 22 of pmi’s global leaf requirements the largest supplies of tobacco leaf are sourced from argentina brazil china india indonesia mostly for domestic use in kretek products malawi mozambique philippines turkey and the united states 

we believe that there is an adequate supply of tobacco leaf in the world markets to satisfy our current and anticipated production requirements 

in addition to tobacco leaf we purchase a wide variety of direct materials from a total of approximately 450 suppliers in 2017 our top ten suppliers of direct materials combined represented approximately 50 of our total direct materials purchases the three most significant direct materials that we purchase are printed paper board used in packaging acetate tow used in filter making and fine paper used in the manufacturing of cigarettes and heated tobacco units in addition the adequate supply and procurement of cloves are of particular importance to our indonesian business 

the adequate supply chain for our rrp portfolio including the supply of electronic devices is important to our business we work with two electronics manufacturing service providers for the supply of our iqos  devices and a small number of other providers for other products in our rrp portfolio and related accessories although we work closely with these service providers on monitoring their production capability and financial health the commercialization of our rrps could be adversely affected if they are unable to meet their commitments the production of our rrp portfolio requires various metals and we believe that there is an adequate supply of such metals in the world markets to satisfy our current and anticipated production requirements however some components and materials necessary for the production of our rrps are obtained from single or limited sources and can be subject to industrywide shortages and price fluctuations our inability to secure an adequate supply of such components and materials could negatively impact the commercialization of our rrps 

our iqos  devices are subject to product warranties which are described in more detail in item 8 note 5  product warranty  to our consolidated financial statements we discuss our rrp products in more detail in item 7  business environment—reduced risk products

our product development is based on the elimination of combustion via tobacco heating and other innovative systems for aerosol generation which we believe is the most promising path to providing a better consumer choice for those who would otherwise continue to smoke we recognize that no single product will appeal to all adult smokers therefore we are developing a portfolio of products intended to appeal to a variety of distinct preferences four rrp platforms are in various stages of development and commercialization readiness we describe each of them in more detail in item 7 business environment—reducedrisk products

in the event of a dispute between us and pm usa under the intellectual property agreement we have agreed with pm usa to submit the dispute first to negotiation between our and pm usa’s senior executives and then to binding arbitration 

seasonality 

  

our business segments are not significantly affected by seasonality although in certain markets cigarette consumption trends rise during the summer months due to longer daylight time and tourism

risks related to our business and industry 

 this decline is due to multiple factors including increased taxes and pricing governmental actions the diminishing social acceptance of smoking continuing economic and geopolitical uncertainty and the continuing prevalence of illicit products these factors and their potential consequences are discussed more fully below and in item 7 business environment  

 tax regimes including excise taxes sales taxes and import duties can disproportionately affect the retail price of cigarettes versus other combustible tobacco products or disproportionately affect the relative retail price of our cigarette brands versus cigarette brands manufactured by certain of our competitors because our portfolio is weighted toward the premiumprice cigarette category tax regimes based on sales price can place us at a competitive disadvantage in certain markets as a result our volume and profitability may be adversely affected in these markets 

increases in cigarette taxes are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on our sales of cigarettes due to resulting lower consumption levels a shift in sales from manufactured cigarettes to other combustible tobacco products and from the premiumprice to the midprice or lowprice cigarette categories where we may be underrepresented from local sales to legal crossborder purchases of lower price products or to illicit products such as contraband counterfeit and illicit whites 

 governmental actions combined with the diminishing social acceptance of smoking and private actions to restrict smoking have resulted in reduced industry volume in many of our markets and we expect that such factors will continue to reduce consumption levels and will increase downtrading and the risk of counterfeiting contraband illicit whites and legal crossborder purchases significant regulatory developments will take place over the next few years in most of our markets driven principally by the world health organizations framework convention on tobacco control “fctc” the fctc is the first international public health treaty on tobacco and its objective is to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation the fctc has led to increased efforts by tobacco control advocates and public health organizations to promote increasingly restrictive regulatory measures on the marketing and sale of tobacco products to adult smokers regulatory initiatives that have been proposed introduced or enacted include 



 7 

 our operating income could be significantly affected by regulatory initiatives resulting in a significant decrease in demand for our brands in particular requirements that lead to a commoditization of tobacco products as well as any significant increase in the cost of complying with new regulatory requirements 

 

there is litigation related to tobacco products pending in certain jurisdictions damages claimed in some tobaccorelated litigation are significant and in certain cases in brazil canada and nigeria range into the billions of us dollars we anticipate that new cases will continue to be filed the fctc encourages litigation against tobacco product manufacturers it is possible that our consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation see item 8 note 18 contingencies “note 18 contingencies ” for a discussion of pending litigation 

 we compete primarily on the basis of product quality brand recognition brand loyalty taste rd innovation packaging customer service marketing advertising and retail price and increasingly adult smoker willingness to convert to our rrps we are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business the competitive environment and our competitive position can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions erosion of consumer confidence competitors introduction of lowerprice products or innovative products higher tobacco product taxes higher absolute prices and larger gaps between retail price categories and product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate tobacco products competitors include three large international tobacco companies and several regional and local tobacco companies and in some instances stateowned tobacco enterprises principally in algeria egypt the prc taiwan thailand and vietnam industry consolidation and privatizations of stateowned enterprises have led to an overall increase in competitive pressures some competitors have different profit and volume objectives and some international competitors are susceptible to changes in different currency exchange rates 

 some of the countries in which we operate face the threat of civil unrest and can be subject to regime changes in others nationalization terrorism conflict and the threat of war may have a significant impact on the business environment economic political regulatory or other developments or natural disasters could disrupt our supply chain manufacturing capabilities or distribution capabilities in addition such developments could lead to loss of property or equipment that are critical to our business in certain markets and difficulty in staffing and managing our operations which could reduce our volumes revenues and net earnings 

in certain markets we are dependent on governmental approvals of various actions such as price changes and failure to obtain such approvals could impair growth of our profitability 

in addition despite our high ethical standards and rigorous control and compliance procedures aimed at preventing and detecting unlawful conduct given the breadth and scope of our international operations we may not be able to detect all potential improper or unlawful conduct by our employees and partners 

 8 

 our business is subject to changes in adult consumer preferences which may be influenced by local economic conditions to be successful we must 

 in periods of economic uncertainty adult consumers may tend to purchase lowerprice brands and the volume of our premiumprice and midprice brands and our profitability could suffer accordingly such downtrading trends may be reinforced by regulation that limits branding communication and product differentiation 

 large quantities of counterfeit cigarettes are sold in the international market we believe that marlboro  is the most heavily counterfeited international cigarette brand although we cannot quantify the revenues we lose as a result of this activity in addition our revenues are reduced by contraband legal crossborder purchases “illicit whites” and nontaxpaid volume produced by local manufacturers 

 investigations include allegations of contraband shipments of cigarettes allegations of unlawful pricing activities within certain markets allegations of underpayment of customs duties andor excise taxes allegations of false and misleading usage of descriptors and allegations of unlawful advertising we cannot predict the outcome of those investigations or whether additional investigations may be commenced and it is possible that our business could be materially affected by an unfavorable outcome of pending or future investigations see note 18 contingencies—other litigation  and item 7 business environmentgovernmental investigations  for a description of certain governmental investigations to which we are subject 

 

our key strategic priorities are to develop and commercialize products that present less risk of harm to adult smokers who switch to those products versus continued smoking and to convince current adult smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke to switch to those rrps for our efforts to be successful we must develop rrps that such adult smokers find acceptable alternatives to smoking conduct rigorous scientific studies to substantiate that they reduce exposure to harmful and potentially harmful constituents in smoke and ultimately that these products present are likely to present or have the potential to present less risk of harm to adult smokers who switch to them versus continued smoking and effectively advocate for the development of sciencebased regulatory frameworks for the development and commercialization of rrps including communication of scientifically substantiated information to enable adult smokers to make better consumer choices we might not succeed in our efforts if we do not succeed but others do we may be at a competitive disadvantage furthermore we cannot predict whether regulators will permit the sale andor marketing of rrps with scientifically substantiated riskreduction claims such restrictions could limit the success of our rrps 

 

to date we have been largely successful in demonstrating to regulators that our rrps are not cigarettes and as such they are generally taxed either as a separate category or as other tobacco products which typically yields more favorable tax rates than cigarettes if we cease to be successful in these efforts rrp unit margins may be adversely affected 

 9 

 we conduct our business primarily in local currency and for purposes of financial reporting the local currency results are translated into us dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period during times of a strengthening us dollar our reported net revenues and operating income will be reduced because the local currency translates into fewer us dollars during periods of local economic crises foreign currencies may be devalued significantly against the us dollar reducing our margins actions to recover margins may result in lower volume and a weaker competitive position 

 

the tax cuts and jobs act that was signed into law in december 2017 constitutes a major change to the us tax system our estimated impact of the tax cuts and jobs act is based on management’s current interpretations and our analysis is ongoing our final tax liability may be materially different from current estimates due to developments such as implementing regulations and clarifications in future periods our effective tax rate and our ability to recover deferred tax assets could be subject to additional uncertainty as a result of such developments furthermore changes in the earnings mix or applicable foreign tax laws may result in significant variability in our effective tax rates because we are a us holding company our most significant source of funds is distributions from our nonus subsidiaries certain countries in which we operate have adopted or could institute currency exchange controls that limit or prohibit our local subsidiaries ability to convert local currency into us dollars or to make payments outside the country this could subject us to the risks of local currency devaluation and business disruption 

 our profit growth may suffer if we are unable to introduce new products or enter new markets successfully to raise prices or to improve the proportion of our sales of higher margin products and in higher margin geographies 

 one element of our growth strategy is to strengthen our brand portfolio and market positions through selective acquisitions and the development of strategic business relationships acquisition and strategic business development opportunities are limited and present risks of failing to achieve efficient and effective integration strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings there is no assurance that we will be able to acquire attractive businesses on favorable terms or that future acquisitions or strategic business developments will be accretive to earnings 

 as with other agricultural commodities the price of tobacco leaf and cloves can be influenced by imbalances in supply and demand and crop quality can be influenced by variations in weather patterns including those caused by climate change tobacco production in certain countries is subject to a variety of controls including government mandated prices and production control programs changes in the patterns of demand for agricultural products could cause farmers to produce less tobacco or cloves any significant change in tobacco leaf and clove prices quality and quantity could affect our profitability and our business 

 

the tobacco industry competes for talent with consumer products and other companies that enjoy greater societal acceptance as a result we may be unable to attract and retain the best global talent 

 10 

 we use information systems to help manage business processes collect and interpret business data and communicate internally and externally with employees suppliers customers and others some of these information systems are managed by thirdparty service providers we have backup systems and business continuity plans in place and we take care to protect our systems and data from unauthorized access nevertheless failure of our systems to function as intended or penetration of our systems by outside parties intent on extracting or corrupting information or otherwise disrupting business processes could place us at a competitive disadvantage result in a loss of revenue assets or personal or other sensitive data litigation and regulatory action cause damage to our reputation and that of our brands and result in significant remediation and other costs failure to protect personal data and respect the rights of data subjects could subject us to substantial fines under regulations such as the eu general data protection regulation 

 

in certain instances we contract with third parties to manufacture some of our products or product parts or to provide other services we may be unable to renew these agreements on satisfactory terms for numerous reasons including government regulations accordingly our costs may increase significantly if we must replace such third parties with our own resources

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend   

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this annual report on form 10k including the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in item 8 and the discussion of risks and cautionary factors that may affect future results in item 1a risk factors  



description of our company   

we are a leading international tobacco company engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes and other nicotinecontaining products in markets outside the united states of america we are building our future on smokefree products that are a much better consumer choice than continuing to smoke cigarettes through multidisciplinary capabilities in product development stateoftheart facilities and scientific substantiation we aim to ensure that our smokefree products meet adult consumer preferences and rigorous regulatory requirements our vision is that these products ultimately replace cigarettes to the benefit of adult smokers society our company and our shareholders 

our cigarettes are sold in more than 180 markets and in many of these markets they hold the number one or number two market share position we have a wide range of premium midprice and lowprice brands our   portfolio comprises both international and local brands in addition to the manufacture and sale of cigarettes we are engaged in the development and commercialization of reducedrisk products rrps rrps is the term we use to refer to products that present are likely to present or have the potential to present less risk of harm to smokers who switch to these products versus continued smoking we have a range of rrps in various stages of development scientific assessment and commercialization because our rrps do not burn tobacco they produce an aerosol that contains far lower quantities of harmful and potentially harmful constituents than found in cigarette smoke 

for all periods presented in this report we managed our business in four segments 

 

to provide a greater focus on both parts of our business  combustible and reducedrisk products  and to support our transformation toward a smokefree future effective january 1 2018 we are managing our business in six reportable segments as follows 

 

we use the term net revenues to refer to our operating revenues from the sale of our products net of sales and promotion incentives our net revenues and operating income are affected by various factors including the volume of products we sell the price of our products changes in currency exchange rates and the mix of products we sell mix is a term used to refer to the proportionate value of premiumprice brands to midprice or lowprice brands in any given market product mix mix can also refer to the proportion of shipment volume in more profitable markets versus shipment volume in less profitable markets geographic mix we often collect excise taxes from our customers and then remit them to governments and in those circumstances we include the excise taxes in our net revenues and in excise taxes on products our cost of sales consists principally of tobacco leaf nontobacco raw materials labor and manufacturing costs as well as the cost of the iqos  devices produced by thirdparty electronics manufacturing service providers 

our marketing administration and research costs include the costs of marketing and selling our products other costs generally not related to the manufacture of our products including general corporate expenses and costs incurred to develop new products the most 

 16 

significant components of our marketing administration and research costs are marketing and sales expenses and general and administrative expenses 

philip morris international inc is a legal entity separate and distinct from its direct and indirect subsidiaries accordingly our right and thus the right of our creditors and stockholders to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of any subsidiary is subject to the prior rights of creditors of such subsidiary except to the extent that claims of our company itself as a creditor may be recognized as a holding company our principal sources of funds including funds to make payment on our debt securities are from the receipt of dividends and repayment of debt from our subsidiaries our principal whollyowned and majorityowned subsidiaries currently are not limited by longterm debt or other agreements in their ability to pay cash dividends or to make other distributions with respect to their common stock 

executive summary 

the following executive summary provides significant highlights from the discussion and analysis that follows 

consolidated operating results 

 



net revenues include 38 billion  in 2017  and 739 million  in 2016  related to the sale of rrps mainly driven by japan these net revenue amounts include excise taxes billed to customers where we collect and remit the excise tax excluding excise taxes net revenues for rrps were 36 billion  in 2017  and 733 million  in 2016     in some jurisdictions including japan we are not responsible for collecting excise taxes 

 

 17 

income taxes  –  our effective income tax rate for 2017   increased  by 128  percentage points to 407  the 2017  tax items that decreased  our diluted eps by 084  per share in the table above were primarily due to the impact of the tax cuts and jobs act which was signed into law in december 2017 

the principal elements of the tax cuts and jobs act relevant to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2017 were 

• a reduction of the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 and 

 in connection with these elements of the tax cuts and jobs act we recognized a provisional expense of 16 billion which was included as a component of income tax expense as follows 

 while the impacts of the tax cuts and jobs act reduced net earnings by 16 billion there was no net impact on operating cash flows for the year as the changes in deferred taxes and income taxes payable offset the net earnings impact at december 31 2017 we recorded an income tax payable of 17 billion representing the transition tax of 22 billion partially offset by foreign tax credits related to foreign withholding taxes previously paid of 05 billion the income tax payable is due over an 8year period beginning in 2018 for further details see item 8 note 11 income taxes  to our consolidated financial statements 

the change in the effective tax rate that decreased  our diluted eps by 003  per share in the table above was primarily due to earnings mix by taxing jurisdiction 

currency  –  the unfavorable  currency impact during 2017  results from the fluctuations of the us dollar especially against the brazilian real egyptian pound euro japanese yen and turkish lira partially offset by the russian ruble this unfavorable  currency movement has impacted our profitability across our primary revenue markets and local currency cost bases 

interest  –  the favorable  impact of interest was due primarily to higher interest income partly offset by higher average debt levels 

operations  –  the increase  in diluted eps of 047  from our operations in the table above was due primarily to the following segments 

 partially offset by 

 

for further details see the consolidated operating results  and operating results by business segment  sections of the following discussion and analysis  

2018 forecasted results –  on february 8 2018 we announced our forecast for 2018 fullyear reported diluted eps to be in a range of 520 to 535 representing a projected increase of approximately 34 to 38 at prevailing exchange rates versus 388  in 2017 excluding a favorable currency impact at thenprevailing exchange rates of approximately 016 per share for the fullyear 2018 the forecast range represents a projected increase of approximately 7 to 10 versus adjusted diluted earnings per share of 472  in 2017 

 18 

this forecast assumes 

 

following the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act our 2018 fullyear diluted earnings per share forecast  based on the current interpretation of the legislation  assumes a fullyear effective tax rate of approximately 28 subject to future regulatory developments and earnings mix by taxing jurisdiction the difference between the 21 statutory rate under the new law and our effective rate reflects the fact that we operate in markets outside the united states and is driven by three main factors foreign tax rate differences nondeductibility of interest expense and a partial disallowance of foreign tax credits related to the application of the rules for global intangible lowtaxed income 

we calculated 2017 adjusted diluted eps as reported diluted eps of 388  plus the 084  per share charge related to tax items during 2017 we did not have an eps impact related to asset impairment and exit costs 

adjusted diluted eps is not a measure under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap we define adjusted diluted eps as reported diluted eps adjusted for asset impairment and exit costs tax items and unusual items we believe it is appropriate to disclose this measure as it represents core earnings improves comparability and helps investors analyze business performance and trends adjusted diluted eps should be considered neither in isolation nor as a substitute for reported diluted eps prepared in accordance with us gaap 

this 2018 guidance excludes the impact of any future acquisitions unanticipated asset impairment and exit cost charges future changes in currency exchange rates further developments related to the tax cuts and jobs act and any unusual events the factors described in item 1a risk factors represent continuing risks to these projections 

discussion and analysis 

critical accounting estimates 

item 8 note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in most instances we must use a particular accounting policy or method because it is the only one that is permitted under us gaap 

the preparation of financial statements requires that we use estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets liabilities net revenues and expenses as well as our disclosure of contingencies if actual amounts differ from previous estimates we include the revisions in our consolidated results of operations in the period during which we know the actual amounts historically aggregate differences if any between our estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 

the selection and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates have been discussed with our audit committee the following is a discussion of the more significant assumptions estimates accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition   we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery of product has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured for our company this means that revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss is transferred to our customers title transfers to our customers upon shipment or upon receipt at the customers location as determined by the sales terms for each transaction the company estimates the cost of sales returns based on historical experience and these estimates are immaterial estimated costs associated with warranty programs for iqos  devices are generally provided for in cost of sales in the period the related revenues are recognized based on a number of factors including historical experience product failure rates and warranty policies 

goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets valuation  we test goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events occur that would warrant such review during the second quarter of 2016 we changed the date of 

 19 

our annual goodwill impairment test from the first quarter to the second quarter the change was made to more closely align the impairment testing date with our longrange planning and forecasting process we had determined that this change in accounting principle was preferable under the circumstances and believe that the change in the annual impairment testing date did not delay accelerate or avoid an impairment charge while the company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment for both goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets to determine if it is more likely than not that an impairment exists the company elects to perform the quantitative assessment for our annual impairment analysis the impairment analysis involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit or nonamortizable intangible asset to the carrying value if the carrying value exceeds the fair value goodwill or a nonamortizable intangible asset is considered impaired to determine the fair value of goodwill we primarily use a discounted cash flow model supported by the market approach using earnings multiples of comparable global and local companies within the tobacco industry at december 31 2017  the carrying value of our goodwill was 77 billion  which is related to ten reporting units each of which consists of a group of markets with similar economic characteristics the estimated fair value of each of our ten reporting units exceeded the carrying value as of december 31 2017  to determine the fair value of nonamortizable intangible assets we primarily use a discounted cash flow model applying the relieffromroyalty method we concluded that the fair value of our nonamortizable intangible assets exceeded the carrying value   these discounted cash flow models include management assumptions relevant for forecasting operating cash flows which are subject to changes in business conditions such as volumes and prices costs to produce discount rates and estimated capital needs management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the fair values are estimated and we believe these assumptions are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use since the march 28 2008 spinoff from altria group inc we have not recorded a charge to earnings for an impairment of goodwill or nonamortizable intangible assets 

marketing and advertising costs   we incur certain costs to support our products through programs that include advertising marketing consumer engagement and trade promotions the costs of our advertising and marketing programs are expensed in accordance with us gaap recognition of the cost related to our consumer engagement and trade promotion programs contain uncertainties due to the judgment required in estimating the potential performance and compliance for each program for volumebased incentives provided to customers management continually assesses and estimates by customer the likelihood of the customers achieving the specified targets and records the reduction of revenue as the sales are made for other trade promotions management relies on estimated utilization rates that have been developed from historical experience changes in the assumptions used in estimating the cost of any individual marketing program would not result in a material change in our financial position results of operations or operating cash flows 

employee benefit plans  as discussed in item 8 note 13 benefit plans  to our consolidated financial statements we provide a range of benefits to our employees and retired employees including pensions postretirement health care and postemployment benefits primarily severance we record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by us gaap these calculations include various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates assumed rates of return on plan assets compensation increases mortality turnover rates and health care cost trend rates we review actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so as permitted by us gaap any effect of the modifications is generally amortized over future periods we believe that the assumptions utilized in calculating our obligations under these plans are reasonable based upon our historical experience and advice from our actuaries 

weightedaverage discount rate assumptions for pensions and postretirement plans are as follows 



we anticipate that assumption changes will decrease 2018 pretax pension and postretirement expense to approximately 164 million as compared with approximately 199 million in 2017 excluding amounts related to early retirement programs the anticipated decrease is primarily due to higher expected return on assets of 21 million coupled with lower amortization out of other comprehensive earnings for prior service cost of 12 million and unrecognized actuarial gainslosses of 10 million partially offset by other movements of 8 million 

weightedaverage expected rate of return and discount rate assumptions have a significant effect on the amount of expense reported for the employee benefit plans a fiftybasispoint decrease in our discount rate would increase our 2018 pension and postretirement expense by approximately 38 million and a fiftybasispoint increase in our discount rate would decrease our 2018 pension and postretirement expense by approximately 54 million similarly a fiftybasispoint decrease increase in the expected return on plan assets would increase decrease our 2018 pension expense by approximately 45 million see item 8 note 13 benefit plans  to our consolidated financial statements for a sensitivity discussion of the assumed health care cost trend rates 

 20 

income taxes   income tax provisions for jurisdictions outside the united states as well as state and local income tax provisions are determined on a separate company basis and the related assets and liabilities are recorded in our consolidated balance sheets 

the extent of our operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions the final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal state and international tax audits in accordance with the authoritative guidance for income taxes we evaluate potential tax exposures and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment an additional charge to expense would result if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 

the effective tax rates used for interim reporting are based on our fullyear geographic earnings mix projections changes in currency exchange rates or earnings mix by taxing jurisdiction could have an impact on the effective tax rates significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions 

for further details see item 8 note 11 income taxes  to our consolidated financial statements 

hedging  as discussed below in “market risk” we use derivative financial instruments principally to reduce exposures to market risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates by creating offsetting exposures for derivatives to which we have elected to apply hedge accounting gains and losses on these derivatives are initially deferred in accumulated other comprehensive losses on the consolidated balance sheet and recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings in the periods when the related hedged transactions are also recognized in operating results if we had elected not to use the hedge accounting provisions gains losses deferred in stockholders’ deficit equity would have been recorded in our net earnings for these derivatives 

contingencies  as   discussed in item 8 note 18 contingencies  to our consolidated financial statements legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened against us andor our subsidiaries andor our indemnitees in various jurisdictions we and our subsidiaries record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated the variability in pleadings in multiple jurisdictions together with the actual experience of management in litigating claims demonstrate that the monetary relief that may be specified in a lawsuit bears little relevance to the ultimate outcome much of the pending tobaccorelated litigation is in its early stages and litigation is subject to uncertainty at the present time while it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur after assessing the information available to it i management has not concluded that it is probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending tobaccorelated cases ii management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss for any of the pending tobaccorelated cases and iii accordingly no estimated loss has been accrued in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes in these cases if any legal defense costs are expensed as incurred

consolidated operating results 

our net revenues excise taxes on products and operating companies income by segment were as follows 





as discussed in item 8 note 12 segment reporting  to our consolidated financial statements we evaluate segment performance and allocate resources based on operating companies income which we define as operating income excluding general corporate expenses and amortization of intangibles plus equity incomeloss in unconsolidated subsidiaries net we believe it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze the business performance and trends of our various business segments

our shipment volume by segment for cigarettes and heated tobacco units was as follows 



heated tobacco units is the term we use to refer to heated tobacco consumables which include our heets   heets marlboro and heets from marlboro  defined collectively as heets  as well as marlboro   heatsticks and  parliament heatsticks 

our net revenues by product category which include excise taxes billed to customers were as follows

2017  compared with 2016   

the following discussion compares our consolidated operating results for the year ended december 31 2017  with the year ended december 31 2016  

estimated international cigarette and heated tobacco unit volume excluding china and the united states of 28 trillion  was down  by 28  

our total shipment volume decreased  by 27  principally due to 

 excluding the favorable net impact of estimated cigarette and heated tobacco unit inventory movements of approximately 33 billion units our total shipment volume decreased by 31  the favorable inventory movements were driven primarily by approximately 85 billion units net in japan reflecting the increasing demand for heatsticks  anticipated to further increase in the first quarter of 2018 following a planned lifting of the restriction on iqos device sales the establishment of appropriate distributor inventory levels of heated tobacco units given the current high dependence on a single manufacturing center and the transition from air freight to sea freight of heated tobacco units largely completed in the fourth quarter of 2017 these favorable inventory movements were partly offset by a reduction of combustible product inventory levels mainly in the european union notably italy and spain eema notably north africa russia and saudi arabia 

 24 

our cigarette shipment volume by brand and heated tobacco unit shipment volume are shown in the table below 



cigarette shipment volume of  marlboro   decreased  in the european union mainly due to greece italy and spain eema predominantly due to saudi arabia reflecting the impact of the new excise tax implemented in june 2017 that resulted in the doubling of the retail price of marlboro  from sar 12 to sar 24 per pack partly offset by north africa notably algeria and egypt and turkey asia mainly due to japan and korea principally reflecting outswitching to heated tobacco products partly offset by indonesia and the philippines and latin america  canada mainly due to argentina and brazil

cigarette shipment volume of the following brands increased chesterfield  notably driven by argentina brazil colombia saudi arabia turkey and venezuela partly offset by italy and russia and philip morris  mainly driven by russia and ukraine notably reflecting successful portfolio consolidation of local lowprice brands in others partly offset by argentina and italy 

our net revenues and excise taxes on products were as follows 



net revenues which include excise taxes billed to customers increased  by 31 billion  excluding excise taxes net revenues increased  by 21 billion  due to 

 

the unfavorable  currency was due primarily to the argentine peso egyptian pound japanese yen philippine peso and turkish lira partially offset by the russian ruble 

  

 25 

net revenues include 38 billion  in 2017  and 739 million  in 2016  related to the sale of rrps mainly driven by japan these net revenue amounts include excise taxes billed to customers excluding excise taxes net revenues for rrps were 36 billion  in 2017  and 733 million  in 2016     in some jurisdictions including japan we are not responsible for collecting excise taxes in 2017  approximately 09 billion of our 36 billion  in rrp net revenues excluding excise taxes were from iqos  devices and accessories 

excise taxes on products increased  by 11 billion  due to 

 our cost of sales marketing administration and research costs and operating income were as follows

marketing administration and research costs increased  by 320 million  due to 

 

operating income increased  by 688 million  due primarily to 

 

interest expense net of 914 million   increased  by 23 million  due primarily to unfavorably currency and higher average debt levels partly offset by higher interest income 

our effective tax rate increased  by 128  percentage points to 407  the 2017  effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by 16 billion due to the tax cuts and jobs act for further details see item 8 note 11 income taxes  to our consolidated financial statements we are continuing to evaluate the impact that the tax cuts and jobs act will have on our tax liability based upon our current interpretation of the tax cuts and jobs act we estimate that our 2018 effective tax rate will be approximately 28  subject to future regulatory developments and earnings mix by taxing jurisdiction 

we are regularly examined by tax authorities around the world and we are currently under examination in a number of jurisdictions it is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months certain tax examinations will close which could result in a change in unrecognized tax benefits along with related interest and penalties an estimate of any possible change cannot be made at this time 

net earnings attributable to pmi of 60 billion   decreased  by 932 million   134  this decrease  was due primarily to a higher effective tax rate as discussed above partly offset by higher operating income diluted and basic eps of 388   decreased  by 134  excluding

the following discussion compares our consolidated operating results for the year ended december 31 2016 with the year ended december 31 2015 

our cigarette shipment volume decreased by 41 or by 47 excluding net estimated inventory movements due to 

 

our cigarette market share increased in a number of markets including brazil canada colombia the czech republic france mexico the netherlands norway poland saudi arabia spain switzerland turkey and the united arab emirates

operating results by business segment 

business environment 

taxes legislation regulation and other matters regarding the manufacture marketing sale and use of tobacco products 

the tobacco industry and our business face a number of challenges that may adversely affect our business volume results of operations cash flows and financial position these challenges which are discussed below and in “ cautionary factors that may affect future results ” include 

 

regulatory restrictions  the tobacco industry operates in a highly regulated environment the wellknown risks of smoking have led regulators to impose significant restrictions and high excise taxes on cigarettes 

we support a comprehensive regulatory framework for tobacco products based on the principle of harm reduction including mandated health warnings minimum age laws restrictions on advertising and public place smoking restrictions we also support regulatory measures that help reduce illicit trade 

 29 

much of the regulation that shapes the business environment in which we operate is driven by the world health organizations “who” framework convention on tobacco control “fctc” which entered into force in 2005 the fctc is the first international public health treaty and has as its main objective to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation with the purpose of reducing tobacco use to date 180 countries and the european union are parties to the fctc the treaty requires parties to have in place various tobacco control measures and recommends others the fctc governing body the conference of the parties “cop” has also adopted nonbinding guidelines and policy recommendations related to certain articles of the fctc that go beyond the text of the treaty 

we have opposed certain measures and continue to engage in a dialogue with regulators with respect to those measures that we do not believe would protect public health and if implemented could disrupt competition severely limit our ability to market and sell our products to adult smokers or increase illicit trade certain measures are discussed in more detail below it is not possible to predict whether or to what extent measures recommended in the fctc guidelines will be implemented 

fiscal challenges  excessive and disruptive excise sales and other tax increases and discriminatory tax structures are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on our profitability due to lower consumption and consumer downtrading to nonpremium discount other lowprice or lowtaxed combustible tobacco products such as fine cut tobacco and illicit cigarettes in addition in certain jurisdictions some of our combustible products are subject to tax structures that discriminate against premiumprice products and manufactured cigarettes we believe that such tax policies undermine public health by encouraging consumers to turn to illicit trade and ultimately undercut government revenue objectives disrupt the competitive environment and encourage criminal activity other jurisdictions have imposed or are seeking to impose levies or other taxes specifically on tobacco companies such as taxes on revenues andor profits 

eu tobacco products directive  in april 2014 the eu adopted the text of a significantly revised eu tobacco products directive tpd which entered into force in may 2016 all 28 member states and norway have adopted laws transposing the tpd the tpd sets forth a comprehensive set of regulatory requirements for tobacco products including 

 

plain packaging and other packaging restrictions  plain packaging legislation bans the use of branding logos and colors on packaging other than the brand name and variant that may be printed only in specified locations and in a uniform font to date australia france georgia hungary ireland new zealand norway slovenia and the uk have adopted plain packaging laws which are in various degrees of implementation 

several countries have initiated world trade organization “wto” dispute settlement proceedings against australia related to australias plain packaging legislation the matter is still pending before the wto panel 

other countries are also considering adopting plain packaging legislation including but not limited to canada singapore south africa and turkey 

some countries have adopted or are considering adopting packaging restrictions that could have an impact similar to plain packaging examples of such restrictions include standardizing the shape and size of packages prohibiting certain colors or the use of certain descriptive phrases on packaging and requiring very large graphic health warnings that leave little space for branding 

restrictions and bans on the use of ingredients  the who and others in the public health community have recommended restrictions or total bans on the use of some or all ingredients in tobacco products including menthol broad restrictions and ingredient bans would require us to reformulate our american blend tobacco products and could reduce our ability to differentiate these products in the market in the long term menthol bans would eliminate the entire category of mentholated tobacco products the european union has banned flavored tobacco products subject to an exemption until may 2020 for menthol other countries may follow the eu’s approach for instance turkey has banned menthol as of may 2020 broader ingredient bans have been adopted by canada and brazil while the canadian ingredient ban initially exempted menthol amendments to the federal tobacco act banned menthol in cigarettes as of october 2017 in addition the canadian parliament is considering further amendments to the act that would extend the menthol ban to all tobacco products the majority of canadian provinces have also adopted or are in the process of adopting menthol bans the brazil ingredients 

 30 

ban which would prohibit the use of virtually all ingredients with flavoring or aromatic properties is not in force due to a legal challenge by a tobacco industry union of which our brazilian subsidiary is a member other lawsuits are also pending against the brazil ingredients ban it is not possible to predict the outcome of these legal proceedings 

  

bans on display of tobacco products at retail  in a number of our markets including but not limited to australia canada norway russia and singapore governments have banned the display of tobacco products at the point of sale other countries are also considering similar bans 

bans and restrictions on advertising marketing promotions and sponsorships  for many years the fctc has called for and countries have imposed partial or total bans on tobacco advertising marketing promotions and sponsorships including bans and restrictions on advertising on radio and television in print and on the internet the fctcs nonbinding guidelines recommend that governments prohibit all forms of communication with adult smokers 

restrictions on product design   some members of the public health community are calling for the further standardization of tobacco products by requiring for example that cigarettes have a certain minimum diameter which would amount to a ban on slim cigarettes or requiring the use of standardized filter and cigarette paper designs in addition at its meeting in november 2016 the cop adopted nonbinding guidelines recommending that countries regulate product design features that increase the attractiveness of tobacco products such as the diameter of cigarettes and the use of flavor capsules 

restrictions on public smoking  the pace and scope of public smoking restrictions have increased significantly in most of our markets many countries around the world have adopted or are likely to adopt regulations that restrict or ban smoking in public andor work places restaurants bars and nightclubs some public health groups have called for and some countries regional governments and municipalities have adopted or proposed bans on smoking in outdoor places as well as bans on smoking in cars typically when minors are present and private homes 

other regulatory issues  some regulators are considering or in some cases have adopted regulatory measures designed to reduce the supply of tobacco products these include regulations intended to reduce the number of retailers selling tobacco products by for example reducing the overall number of tobacco retail licenses available or banning the sale of tobacco products within arbitrary distances of certain public facilities 

in a limited number of markets most notably japan we are dependent on governmental approvals that may limit our pricing flexibility 

illicit trade  the illicit tobacco trade creates a cheap and unregulated supply of tobacco products undermines efforts to reduce smoking prevalence especially among youth damages legitimate businesses stimulates organized crime increases corruption and reduces government tax revenue illicit trade may account for as much as 10 of global cigarette consumption this includes counterfeit contraband and the growing problem of “illicit whites” which are cigarettes legally produced in one jurisdiction for the sole purpose of being exported and illegally sold in another jurisdiction where they have no legitimate market we estimate that illicit trade in the european union accounted for slightly less than 10 of total cigarette consumption in 2016 

a number of jurisdictions are considering actions to prevent illicit trade in november 2012 the fctc adopted the protocol to eliminate illicit trade in tobacco products the “protocol” which includes supply chain control measures such as licensing of manufacturers and distributors enforcement in free trade zones controls on duty free and internet sales and the implementation of tracking and tracing technologies to date 54 parties have signed the protocol and 35 parties including the european union have ratified it the protocol will come into force once the fortieth party ratifies it after which countries must implement its measures via national legislation we expect and welcome that other parties will ratify the protocol 

as discussed in the eu tobacco products directive  section above the eu regulations that mandate tracking and tracing of cigarettes and rollyourown products manufactured or destined for the eu will become effective on may 20 2019 the effective date for other tobaccocontaining products including some of our rrps such as the heated tobacco units used with iqos  is may 20 2024 

in 2009 our colombian subsidiaries entered into an investment and cooperation agreement with the national and regional governments of colombia to promote investment in and cooperation on anticontraband and anticounterfeit efforts the agreement provides 200 million in funding over a 20year period to address issues such as combating the illegal cigarette trade and increasing the quality and quantity of locallygrown tobacco 

in may 2016 pmi launched pmi impact a global initiative that supports thirdparty projects dedicated to fighting illegal trade and related crimes such as corruption organized criminal networks and money laundering the centerpiece of pmi impact is a council of external independent experts with impeccable credentials in the fields of law anticorruption and law enforcement the experts are 

 31 

responsible for evaluating and approving funding proposals for pmi impact grants pmi has pledged 100 million to fund projects within pmi impact over three funding rounds substantially all grants under the first funding round were awarded in 2017 the second funding round began in september 2017 

in november 2016 pmi signed a joint declaration of intent to prevent the maritime transportation of counterfeit goods together with eight other global brand owners and five of the world’s largest shipping companies this commitment was a result of a dialogue with the international chamber of commerce’s business action to stop counterfeiting and piracy the signatories aim to tackle the infiltration of shipping services by criminal networks that exploit vessels to transport counterfeit goods including “illicit whites” across the oceans 

reducedrisk products rrps   

our approach to rrps   we recognize that smoking cigarettes causes serious diseases and that the best way to avoid the harms of smoking is never to start or to quit nevertheless it is predicted that over the next decade the number of smokers will remain largely unchanged from the current estimate of 11 billion despite the considerable efforts to discourage smoking 

cigarettes burn tobacco which produces smoke as a result of the combustion process the smoker inhales various toxic substances in contrast rrps do not burn tobacco and produce an aerosol that contains significantly lower levels of harmful and potentially harmful constituents hphcs than found in cigarette smoke 

for smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke we believe that rrps offer a much better consumer choice accordingly our key strategic priorities are to develop and commercialize products that present less risk of harm to adult smokers who switch to those products versus continued smoking and to convince current adult smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke to switch to those products 

we recognize that this transformation from cigarettes to rrps will take time and that the speed of transformation will depend in part upon factors beyond our control such as the willingness of governments regulators and other policy groups to embrace rrps as a desired alternative to continued cigarette smoking we also recognize that our part in this transformation must be funded from our existing cigarette business for as long as a significant number of adult smokers continues to smoke it is critical that the industry be led by responsible and ethical manufacturers therefore during the transformation we intend to remain a leading international cigarette manufacturer 

we have a range of rrps in various stages of development scientific assessment and commercialization we conduct rigorous scientific assessments of our rrp platforms to substantiate that they reduce exposure to hphcs and ultimately that these products present are likely to present or have the potential to present less risk of harm to adult smokers who switch to them versus continued smoking we draw upon a team of expert scientists and engineers from a broad spectrum of scientific disciplines and our extensive learnings of adult consumer preferences to develop and assess our rrps our efforts are guided by the following key objectives 

 

our rrp platforms   our product development is based on the elimination of combustion via tobacco heating and other innovative systems for aerosol generation which we believe is the most promising path to providing a better consumer choice for those who would otherwise continue to smoke we recognize that no single product will appeal to all adult smokers therefore we are developing a portfolio of products intended to appeal to a variety of distinct adult consumer preferences 

four rrp platforms are in various stages of development and commercialization readiness 

  platform 1  uses a precisely controlled heating device that we are commercializing under the iqos  brand name into which a specially designed and proprietary tobacco unit is inserted and heated to generate an aerosol we have conducted a series of clinical studies for this platform the results of which were included in our submission to the us food and drug administration “fda” described below as anticipated the results of the first sixmonth term of the 66 month exposure response study were received at the 

 32 

end of 2017 and the related report is under preparation we expect to submit the final report for these results to the fda in may of 2018 we expect to receive the results of the second sixmonth term of the study for analysis in the second quarter of 2018 

  platform 2  uses a pressed carbon heat source which when ignited generates an aerosol by heating tobacco the results of our pharmacokinetic study that measured the nicotine pharmacokinetic profile and subjective effects and of our fiveday reduced exposure study with platform 2  indicate that this platform could be an acceptable substitute for adult smokers who seek an alternative to cigarettes furthermore the reduced exposure study showed a substantial reduction in relevant biomarkers of exposure to hphcs in those who switched to platform 2 compared to those who continued to smoke cigarettes over a fiveday period the sustainability of this reduction as well as changes in clinical risk markers were assessed in a 3month reduced exposure study as anticipated the results of this study were received at the end of 2017 and the related report is under preparation we expect the report to be finalized in the second quarter of 2018 subsequently in accordance with standard scientific practices we intend to share the conclusions in scientific forums and to submit them for inclusion in peerreviewed publications 

  platform 3  provides an aerosol of nicotine salt formed by the chemical reaction of nicotine with a weak organic acid we have explored two routes for this platform one with electronics and one without and have initiated a new nicotine pharmacokinetic study we expect to receive the results for analysis in the second quarter of 2018 

  platform 4  covers evapor products which are batterypowered devices that produce an aerosol by vaporizing a nicotinecontaining liquid solution our evapor products comprise devices using current generation technology and we are well advanced in the development and commercialization of our new evapor mesh technology that addresses certain challenges presented by some evapor products currently on the market our mesh products are designed to ensure the consistency and quality of the generated aerosol we have initiated a nicotine pharmacokinetic study for which we expect to receive the results for analysis in the second quarter of 2018 the results of this study are expected to contribute to further developments of platform 4  products 

commercialization of rrps   we are building a new product category and tailor our commercialization strategy to the characteristics of each specific market we focus our commercialization efforts on retail experience guided consumer trials and customer care as well as digital communication programs in order to accelerate switching to iqos  our initial market introductions typically entail oneonone consumer engagement and introductory device discounts these initial commercialization efforts require substantial investment 

in 2014 we introduced the iqos  system in pilot city launches in nagoya japan and in milan italy since then we have expanded our commercialization activities to include all of japan as well as multiple cities in italy to date iqos is available for sale in key cities in 37 markets and nationwide in japan 

on the basis of our experience in japan and italy we estimate that only a very small percentage of adult smokers who convert to iqos  switch back to cigarettes 

in the first quarter of 2016 we started the large scale commercial production of heated tobacco units during 2017 we experienced supply shortages resulting from strongerthananticipated demand primarily in japan currently we are no longer experiencing capacity limitations we are integrating the production of our heated tobacco units into a number of our existing manufacturing facilities and progressing with our plans to build manufacturing capacity for our other rrp platforms 

in 2017 we secured a second supplier of iqos  devices we are no longer experiencing supply constraints on the iqos  devices and based on demand forecasts we expect to be able to fully supply our current and planned launch markets with such devices 

the adequate supply chain for our rrp portfolio including the supply of electronic devices is important to our business we work with two electronics manufacturing service providers for the supply of our iqos  devices and a small number of other providers for other products in our rrp portfolio and related accessories although we work closely with these service providers on monitoring their production capability and financial health the commercialization of our rrps could be adversely affected if they are unable to meet their commitments the production of our rrp portfolio requires various metals and we believe that there is an adequate supply of such metals in the world markets to satisfy our current and anticipated production requirements however some components and materials necessary for the production of our rrps including those for the electronic devices are obtained from single or limited sources and can be subject to industrywide shortages and price fluctuations our inability to secure an adequate supply of such components and materials could negatively impact the commercialization of our rrps 

our iqos  devices are subject to standard product warranties generally for a period of 12 months from the date of purchase or such other periods as required by law we discuss product warranties in more detail in note 5 product warranty  the significance of warranty claims is dependent on a number of factors including warranty policies and product failure rates and may increase with the number of devices sold 

 33 

to further improve the consumer experience we introduced a new version of the iqos  device in the first quarter of 2017 and continue to develop product improvements 

we are also progressing with our commercialization efforts for the other platforms 

 

 

 

rrp regulation and taxation  rrps contain nicotine and are not riskfree we therefore support sciencebased regulation and taxation of rrps regulation and taxation should differentiate between cigarettes and products that present are likely to present or have the potential to present less risk of harm to adult smokers who switch to these products versus continued smoking regulation should provide minimum standards for rrps and specific rules for product assessment methodologies ingredients labelling and consumer communication and should ensure that the public is informed about the health risks of all combustible and noncombustible tobacco and nicotinecontaining products regulation as well as tobacco industry activities should reflect the fact that youth should not consume nicotine in any form 

some governments have banned or are seeking to ban or severely restrict emerging tobacco and nicotinecontaining products such as our rrps these regulations might foreclose or unreasonably restrict adult consumer access even to products that might be shown to be a better consumer choice than continuing to smoke we oppose such blanket bans and unreasonable restrictions of products that have the potential to present less risk of harm compared to continued smoking by contrast we support regulation that sets clear standards and propels innovation to benefit adult smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke 

in the united states an established regulatory framework for assessing “modified risk tobacco products” and “new tobacco products” exists under the jurisdiction of the fda we submitted to the fda a modified risk tobacco product application “mrtpa” for iqos  in december 2016 and a premarket tobacco product application “pmta” for iqos  in march 2017 in may 2017 the fda formally accepted and filed our mrtpa for substantive scientific review and in june 2017 the fda opened the period for the public to provide comments on our application in august 2017 the fda completed a preliminary review of our pmta and accepted our application for substantive review the fda referred our mrtpa to the tobacco product scientific advisory committee “tpsac” tpsac held a meeting on january 24 and january 25 2018 on our mrtpa the recommendations and votes of tpsac are not binding on the fda by regulation the fda’s decision on our mrtpa will take into account in addition to the views of tpsac scientific evidence as well as comments data and information submitted by interested persons 

separately on july 28 2017 the fda issued a policy announcement aiming to explore the potential of nicotine reduction in cigarettes in conjunction with less harmful products that deliver nicotine for adults who choose to use such products 

future fda actions may influence the regulatory approach of other governments 

in the eu all eu member states and norway have transposed the eu tobacco products directive including the provisions on novel tobacco products such as heated tobacco units and ecigarettes most of the eu member states require a notification submitted six months before the intended placing on the market of a novel tobacco product while some require premarket authorizations for the introduction of such products to date we have filed a comprehensive dossier summarizing our scientific assessment of iqos  in 22 member states 

on december 12 2017 at the request of the uk department of health and public health england the uk committee on toxicity published its assessment of the risk of heated tobacco products relative to cigarette smoking this assessment included analysis of scientific data for two heated tobacco products one of which was iqos  the assessment concluded that while still harmful to health compared with the known risks from cigarettes heated tobacco products are probably less harmful subsequently on february 6 2018 public health england published a report stating that the available evidence suggests that heated tobacco products may be considerably less harmful than cigarettes and more harmful than ecigarettes 

 34 

we make our scientific findings publicly available for scrutiny and peer review through several channels including our websites from time to time adult consumers competitors members of the scientific community and others inquire into our scientific methodologies challenge our scientific conclusions or request further study of certain aspects of our rrps and their health effects we are committed to a robust and open scientific debate but believe that such debate should be based on accurate and reliable scientific information we seek to provide accurate and reliable scientific information about our rrps nonetheless we may not be able to prevent thirdparty dissemination of false misleading or unsubstantiated information about these products 

to date we have been largely successful in demonstrating to regulators that our rrps are not cigarettes and as such they are generally taxed either as a separate category or as other tobacco products which typically yields more favorable tax rates than cigarettes although we believe that this is sensible from the public health perspective we cannot guarantee that regulators will continue this approach 

there can be no assurance that we will succeed in our efforts to replace cigarettes with rrps or that regulation will allow us to commercialize rrps in all markets to communicate scientifically substantiated riskreduction claims or to treat rrps differently from cigarettes 

our rrp business development initiatives   in december 2013 we established a strategic framework with altria group inc “altria” under which altria will make available its evapor products exclusively to us for commercialization outside the united states and we will make available two of our rrps exclusively to altria for commercialization in the united states in march 2015 we launched solaris  a platform 4 evapor product licensed from altria in spain in december 2015 we introduced solaris  in israel 

in july 2015 we extended the strategic framework with altria to include a joint research development and technology sharing agreement the additional agreement provides the framework under which pmi and altria will collaborate to develop the next generation of evapor products for commercialization in the united states by altria and in markets outside the united states by pmi the collaboration between pmi and altria in this endeavor is enabled by exclusive technology cross licenses and technical information sharing the agreements also provide for cooperation on the scientific assessment of and for the sharing of improvements to the existing generation of licensed products 

other developments  on september 12 2017 we announced our support of the foundation for a smokefree world we agreed to contribute 80 million per year over the next 12 years as specified in the agreement we made an initial contribution of 45 million in 2017 and the first annual contribution of 80 million in the beginning of 2018 the foundation is an independent body and is governed by its independent board of directors the foundation’s role as set out in its corporate charter includes funding research in the field of tobacco harm reduction encouraging measures that reduce the harm caused by smoking and assessing the effect of reduced cigarette consumption on the industry value chain 

governmental investigations 

from time to time we are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters we describe certain matters pending in thailand and south korea in item 8 note 18 contingencies  

in november 2010 a wto panel issued its decision in a dispute relating to facts that arose from august 2006 between the philippines and thailand concerning a series of thai customs and tax measures affecting cigarettes imported by pm thailand into thailand see item 8 note 18 contingencies for additional information the wto panel decision which was upheld by the wto appellate body concluded that thailand had no basis to find that pm thailands declared customs values and taxes paid were too low as alleged by the dsi in 2009 the decision also created obligations for thailand to revise its laws regulations or practices affecting the customs valuation and tax treatment of future cigarette imports thailand agreed in september 2011 to fully comply with the decision by october 2012 the philippines asserts that to date thailand has not fully complied with the wto panel decision the philippines has repeatedly expressed concerns with ongoing investigations by thailand of pm thailand including those that led to the criminal charges described in item 8 note 18 contingencies  and has commenced two formal proceedings at the wto to challenge criminal charges against pm thailand arguing that the criminal charges appear to be based on grounds not supported by wto customs valuation rules and inconsistent with several decisions already taken by thai customs and other thai governmental agencies 

acquisitions and other business arrangements 

we discuss our acquisitions and other business arrangements in item 8 note 6 acquisitions and other business arrangements  to our consolidated financial statements 

 35 

investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries 

we discuss our investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries in item 8 note 4 investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries  to our consolidated financial statements 

trade policy 

we are subject to various trade restrictions imposed by the united states of america and countries in which we do business “trade sanctions” including the trade and economic sanctions administered by the us department of the treasurys office of foreign assets control and the us department of state it is our policy to comply fully with these trade sanctions 

tobacco products are agricultural products under us law and are not technological or strategic in nature from time to time we make sales in countries subject to trade sanctions either where such sanctions do not apply to our business or pursuant to exemptions or licenses 

to our knowledge none of our commercial arrangements results in the governments of any country identified by the us government as a state sponsor of terrorism nor entities controlled by those governments receiving cash or acting as intermediaries in violation of us laws 

we do not sell products in iran sudan north korea and syria from time to time we explore opportunities to sell our products in one or more of these countries as permitted by law 

in january 2018 we commenced sales of cigarettes in cuba as permitted by law 

certain states within the us have enacted legislation permitting state pension funds to divest or abstain from future investment in stocks of companies that do business with certain countries that are sanctioned by the us we do not believe such legislation has had a material effect on the price of our shares

financial review 

Ÿ net cash provided by operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities of 89 billion  for the year ended december 31 2017  increased  by 08 billion  from the comparable 2016  period while the impacts of the tax cuts and jobs act reduced net earnings by 16 billion there was no net impact on operating cash flows for the year as the changes in deferred taxes and income taxes payable offset the net earnings impact excluding the impact of the tax cuts and jobs act as well as favorable currency movements of 04 billion the increase in cash flows provided by operating activities can be attributed to higher net earnings offset by working capital and other movements 

at december 31 2017 pmi recorded an income tax payable of 17 billion representing the transition tax of 22 billion partially offset by foreign tax credits related to foreign withholding taxes previously paid of 05 billion the income tax payable is due over an 8year period beginning in 2018 for further details see item 8 note 11 income taxes  to our consolidated financial statements 

net cash provided by operating activities of 81 billion for the year ended december 31 2016 increased by 212 million from the comparable 2015 period excluding unfavorable currency movements of 409 million the change was due primarily to net earnings growth and lower cash payments related to exit costs partly offset by higher working capital requirements and 2016 installment payments of security into a court trust pertaining to the létourneau and blais  cases as well as a 2016 payment to the south korean tax authorities see item 8 note 18 contingencies  for additional information 

excluding currency the unfavorable variance in working capital was due primarily to the following

Ÿ net cash used in investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities of 30 billion  for the year ended december 31 2017  increased  by 20 billion  from the comparable 2016  period this increase in net cash used of 20 billion  was due principally to cash collateral posted to secure derivatives designated as net investment hedges of euro assets following the strengthening of the euro versus the us dollar and higher capital expenditures for further details on our derivatives designated as net investment hedges see item 8 note 15 financial instruments  

net cash used in investing activities of 968 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  increased  by 260 million  from the comparable 2015  period due primarily to higher capital expenditures 

our capital expenditures were 15 billion  in 2017  12 billion  in 2016  and 10 billion  in 2015  the 2017  expenditures were primarily related to our ongoing investments in rrps to support capacity expansion notably for heated tobacco units we expect total capital expenditures in 2018  of approximately 17 billion including additional capital expenditures related to our ongoing investment in rrps to support capacity expansion to be funded by operating cash flows 

Ÿ net cash used in financing activities 

during 2017  net cash used in financing activities was 28 billion  compared with net cash used in financing activities of 54 billion  during 2016  and 47 billion  in 2015  

the 2017  change was due primarily to higher proceeds from longterm debt issuances primarily the 69 billion  proceeds in 2017  from our us dollar and euro debt issuances versus the 35 billion  proceeds in 2016  from our us dollar and euro debt issuances 

the 2016 change was due primarily to lower net proceeds received from the sale of subsidiary shares to noncontrolling interests partially offset by higher proceeds from longterm debt issuances for further details on the proceeds from the sale of subsidiary shares in 2015 see item 8 note 6 acquisitions and other business arrangements  to our consolidated financial statements 

dividends paid in 2017  2016  and 2015  were 65 billion  64 billion  and 63 billion  respectively 

Ÿ debt and liquidity 

we define cash and cash equivalents as shortterm highly liquid investments readily convertible to known amounts of cash that mature within a maximum of three months and have an insignificant risk of change in value due to interest rate or credit risk changes as a policy we do not hold any investments in structured or equitylinked products our cash and cash equivalents are predominantly held in demand deposits with institutions that have investmentgrade longterm credit rating as part of our cash management strategy and in order to manage counterparty exposure we also enter into reverse repurchase agreements such agreements are collateralized with government or corporate securities held by a custodial bank and at maturity cash is paid back to pmi and the collateral is returned to the bank while we entered into these agreements during the periods and had an average balance during 2017 and 2016 of 09 billion and 02 billion respectively we had a zero balance both at december 31 2017  and december 31 2016  

we utilize longterm and shortterm debt financing including a commercial paper program that is regularly used to finance ongoing liquidity requirements as part of our overall cash management strategy our ability to access the capital and credit markets as well as overall dynamics of these markets may impact borrowing costs we expect that the combination of our longterm and shortterm debt financing the commercial paper program and the committed credit facilities coupled with our operating cash flows will enable us to meet our liquidity requirements 

credit ratings  – the cost and terms of our financing arrangements as well as our access to commercial paper markets may be affected by applicable credit ratings at february 9 2018 our credit ratings and outlook by major credit rating agencies were as follows 



credit facilities  –   on january 29 2018 we entered into an agreement to extend the term of our 20 billion  364day revolving credit facility from february 6 2018 to february 5 2019 on august 29 2017 we entered into an agreement effective october 1 2017 to 

 63 

extend the term of our 35 billion  multiyear revolving credit facility for an additional year covering the period october 1 2021 to october 1 2022 

  

at february 9 2018 our committed credit facilities were as follows 



at february 9 2018 there were no borrowings under the committed credit facilities and the entire committed amounts were available for borrowing 

all banks participating in our committed credit facilities have an investmentgrade longterm credit rating from the credit rating agencies we continuously monitor the credit quality of our banking group and at this time we are not aware of any potential nonperforming credit provider 

each of these facilities requires us to maintain a ratio of consolidated earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “consolidated ebitda” to consolidated interest expense of not less than 35 to 10 on a rolling fourquarter basis at december 31 2017  our ratio calculated in accordance with the agreements was 106  to 10 these facilities do not include any credit rating triggers material adverse change clauses or any provisions that could require us to post collateral we expect to continue to meet our covenants the terms “consolidated ebitda” and “consolidated interest expense” both of which include certain adjustments are defined in the facility agreements previously filed with the us securities and exchange commission 

in addition to the committed credit facilities discussed above certain of our subsidiaries maintain shortterm credit arrangements to meet their respective working capital needs these credit arrangements which amounted to approximately 28 billion  at december 31 2017  and 29 billion  at december 31 2016  are for the sole use of our subsidiaries borrowings under these arrangements amounted to 499 million  at december 31 2017  and 643 million  at december 31 2016  

commercial paper program –  we continue to have access to liquidity in the commercial paper market through programs in place in the us and in europe having an aggregate issuance capacity of 80 billion at december 31 2017  and december 31 2016  we had no commercial paper outstanding the average commercial paper balance outstanding during 2017  and 2016   was 52 billion  and 42 billion  respectively 

sale of accounts receivable  –  to mitigate credit risk and enhance cash and liquidity management we sell trade receivables to unaffiliated financial institutions these arrangements allow us to sell on an ongoing basis certain trade receivables without recourse the trade receivables sold are generally shortterm in nature and are removed from the consolidated balance sheets we sell trade receivables under two types of arrangements servicing and nonservicing 

our operating cash flows were positively impacted by the amount of the trade receivables sold and derecognized from the consolidated balance sheets which remained outstanding with the unaffiliated financial institutions the trade receivables sold that remained outstanding under these arrangements as of december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  were 1092 million  729 million  and 888 million  respectively the net proceeds received are included in cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 

for further details see item 8 note 20 sale of accounts receivable  to our consolidated financial statements 

debt  –  our total debt was 343 billion  at december 31 2017  and 291 billion  at december 31 2016  our total debt is primarily fixed rate in nature for further details see item 8 note 7 indebtedness  the weightedaverage allin financing cost of our total debt was 26 in 2017  compared to 28 in 2016  see item 8 note 16 fair value measurements  to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our disclosures related to the fair value of debt the amount of debt that we can issue is subject to approval by our board of directors 

 64 

on february 14 2017 we filed a shelf registration statement with the us securities and exchange commission under which we may from time to time sell debt securities andor warrants to purchase debt securities over a threeyear period 

our debt issuances in 2017  were as follows 



a  interest on these notes is payable semiannually in arrears beginning in august 2017 

b  interest on these notes is payable quarterly in arrears beginning in may 2017 

c  interest on these notes is payable semiannually in arrears beginning in february 2018 

d interest on these notes is payable semiannually in arrears beginning may 2018 

e interest on these notes is payable semiannually in arrears beginning march 2018 

f interest on these notes is payable annually in arrears beginning november 2018 

the net proceeds from the sale of the securities listed in the table above were used for general corporate purposes 

the weightedaverage time to maturity of our longterm debt was 94 years at the end of 2017  and 106 years at the end of 2016  

 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements including special purpose entities other than guarantees and contractual obligations discussed below 

guarantees  –  at december 31 2017  we were contingently liable for 09 billion of guarantees of our own performance which were primarily related to excise taxes on the shipment of our products there is no liability in the consolidated financial statements associated with these guarantees at december 31 2017  our thirdparty guarantees were insignificant 

 65 

aggregate contractual obligations  –  the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2017  



1  amounts represent the expected cash payments of our longterm debt and capital lease obligations 

2  amounts represent the expected cash payments of our interest expense on our longterm debt including the current portion of longterm debt interest on our fixedrate debt is presented using the stated interest rate interest on our variable debt is estimated using the rate in effect at december 31 2017 amounts exclude the amortization of debt discounts the amortization of loan fees and fees for lines of credit that would be included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of earnings 

3  amounts represent the minimum rental commitments under noncancelable operating leases 

4  purchase obligations for inventory and production costs such as raw materials indirect materials and supplies packaging comanufacturing arrangements storage and distribution are commitments for projected needs to be utilized in the normal course of business other purchase obligations include commitments for marketing advertising capital expenditures information technology and professional services arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction amounts represent the minimum commitments under noncancelable contracts any amounts reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as accounts payable and accrued liabilities are excluded from the table above 

5  other longterm liabilities consist primarily of postretirement health care costs and accruals established for employment costs the following longterm liabilities included on the consolidated balance sheet are excluded from the table above accrued pension and postemployment costs tax contingencies insurance accruals and other accruals we are unable to estimate the timing of payments or contributions in the case of accrued pension costs for these items currently we anticipate making pension contributions of approximately 53 million  in 2018  based on current tax and benefit laws as discussed in item 8 note 13 benefit plans  to our consolidated financial statements 

Ÿ equity and dividends 

we discuss our stock awards as of december 31 2017  in item 8 note 9 stock plans to our consolidated financial statements 

during 2017  2016  and 2015  we did not repurchase any shares under a share repurchase program and we do not presently intend to repurchase shares of our common stock in 2018  

dividends paid in 2017  were 65 billion  during the third quarter of 2017 our board of directors approved a 29 increase in the quarterly dividend to 107 per common share as a result the present annualized dividend rate is 428 per common share 

market risk 

Ÿ counterparty risk    we predominantly work with financial institutions with strong short and longterm credit ratings as assigned by standard  poor’s and moody’s these banks are also part of a defined group of relationship banks noninvestment grade institutions are only used in certain emerging markets to the extent required by local business needs we have a conservative approach when it comes to choosing financial counterparties and financial instruments as such we do not invest or hold investments in any structured or equitylinked products the majority of our cash and cash equivalents is currently invested in demand deposits maturing within less than 30 days 

we continuously monitor and assess the credit worthiness of all our counterparties 

Ÿ derivative financial instruments   we operate in markets outside of the us with manufacturing and sales facilities in various locations throughout the world consequently we use certain financial instruments to manage our foreign currency and interest rate exposure we use derivative financial instruments principally to reduce our exposure to market risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign 

 66 

exchange rates by creating offsetting exposures we are not a party to leveraged derivatives and by policy do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 

see item 8 note 15 financial instruments  item 8 note 16 fair value measurements  and item 8 note 19 balance sheet offsetting  to our consolidated financial statements for further details on our derivative financial instruments and the related collateral arrangements 

Ÿ value at risk    we use a value at risk computation to estimate the potential oneday loss in the fair value of our interestratesensitive financial instruments and to estimate the potential oneday loss in pretax earnings of our foreign currency pricesensitive derivative financial instruments this computation includes our debt shortterm investments and foreign currency forwards swaps and options anticipated transactions foreign currency trade payables and receivables and net investments in foreign subsidiaries which the foregoing instruments are intended to hedge were excluded from the computation 

the computation estimates were made assuming normal market conditions using a 95 confidence interval we use a “variancecovariance” model to determine the observed interrelationships between movements in interest rates and various currencies these interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate and forward currency rate movements over the preceding quarter for determining value at risk at december 31 2017  and 2016  and over each of the four preceding quarters for the calculation of average value at risk amounts during each year the values of foreign currency options do not change on a onetoone basis with the underlying currency and were valued accordingly in the computation 

the estimated potential oneday loss in fair value of our interestratesensitive instruments primarily debt under normal market conditions and the estimated potential oneday loss in pretax earnings from foreign currency instruments under normal market conditions as calculated in the value at risk model were as follows 



the value at risk computation is a risk analysis tool designed to statistically estimate the maximum probable daily loss from adverse movements in interest and foreign currency rates under normal market conditions the computation does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value or earnings to be incurred by us nor does it consider the effect of favorable changes in market rates we cannot predict actual future movements in such market rates and do not present these results to be indicative of future movements in market rates or to be representative of any actual impact that future changes in market rates may have on our future results of operations or financial position 

 67 

contingencies 

see item 3 and item 8 note 18 contingencies  to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of contingencies 

cautionary factors that may affect future results 

forwardlooking and cautionary statements 

we may from time to time make written or oral forwardlooking statements including statements contained in filings with the sec in reports to stockholders and in press releases and investor webcasts you can identify these forwardlooking statements by use of words such as strategy expects continues plans anticipates believes will estimates intends projects goals targets and other words of similar meaning you can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 

we cannot guarantee that any forwardlooking statement will be realized although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions achievement of future results is subject to risks uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate actual results could vary materially from those anticipated estimated or projected investors should bear this in mind as they consider forwardlooking statements and whether to invest in or remain invested in our securities in connection with the “safe harbor” provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 we are identifying important factors that individually or in the aggregate could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements made by us any such statement is qualified by reference to the following cautionary statements we elaborate on these and other risks we face throughout this document particularly in item 1a risk factors and business environment  of this section you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors consequently you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties we do not undertake to update any forwardlooking statement that we may make from time to time except in the normal course of our public disclosure obligations

the relative percentages of operating companies income attributable to each reportable segment were as follows 

  



 

 

we use the term net revenues to refer to our operating revenues from the sale of our products net of sales and promotion incentives our net revenues and operating income are affected by various factors including the volume of products we sell the price of our products changes in currency exchange rates and the mix of products we sell mix is a term used to refer to the proportionate value of premiumprice brands to midprice or lowprice brands in any given market product mix mix can also refer to the proportion of shipment volume in more profitable markets versus shipment volume in less profitable markets geographic mix we often collect excise taxes from our customers and then remit them to local governments and in those circumstances we include excise taxes in our net revenues and excise taxes on products our cost of sales consists principally of tobacco leaf nontobacco raw materials labor and manufacturing costs 

our marketing administration and research costs include the costs of marketing and selling our products other costs generally not related to the manufacture of our products including general corporate expenses and costs incurred to develop new products the most significant components of our marketing administration and research costs are marketing and sales expenses and general and administrative expenses

consumer focused marketing  sales 

  

in 2016 we continued to deploy our new strategic framework that combines our marketing and sales expertise with our indepth knowledge of various sales territories this framework allows us not only to engage more effectively with our adult smokers but also to enhance the success of our direct and indirect trade partners the main benefits are 

  

 

the four main types of distribution that we use globally often simultaneously in a given market are 

  

   

in many markets we also directly supply key accounts including gas stations retail chains and supermarkets 

  

our distribution and sales systems are supported by sales forces that total approximately 19800 employees worldwide our sales forces are well trained and recognized by trade surveys for their professionalism 

our products are marketed and promoted through various media and channels including where permitted by law point of sale communications brand events accessrestricted websites and printed and direct communication to verified adult smokers our direct communication with verified adult smokers utilizes mail email and other electronic communication tools promotional activities include where permitted by law competitions invitations to events interactive programs consumer premiums and price promotions to support advertising and promotional activities in the markets we have a dedicated consumer engagement group that develops innovative engagement tools for adult smokers based on the latest technologies and adult smoker trends in addition we developed digital and nondigital engagement programs for retailers

competition 

  

we are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business we compete primarily on the basis of product quality brand recognition brand loyalty taste innovation packaging service marketing advertising and retail price our competitors include three large international tobacco companies and several regional and local tobacco companies and in some instances stateowned tobacco enterprises principally in algeria egypt the prc taiwan thailand and vietnam industry consolidation and privatizations of stateowned enterprises have led to an overall increase in competitive pressures some competitors have different profit and volume objectives and some international competitors are susceptible to changes in different currency exchange rates we predominantly sell american blend cigarette brands such as marlboro  lm   parliament  and chesterfield  which are the most popular across many of our markets we seek to compete in all profitable retail price categories although our brand portfolio is weighted towards the premiumprice category 

  procurement and raw materials 

  

we purchase tobacco leaf of various types grades and styles throughout the world mostly through independent tobacco suppliers we also contract directly with farmers in several countries including argentina brazil colombia ecuador italy kazakhstan pakistan the philippines and poland direct sourcing from farmers represents approximately 17 of pmi’s global leaf requirements the largest supplies of tobacco leaf are sourced from brazil indonesia mostly for domestic use in kretek products china malawi india the united states mozambique argentina philippines and tanzania 

we believe that there is an adequate supply of tobacco leaf in the world markets to satisfy our current and anticipated production requirements 

in addition to tobacco leaf we purchase a wide variety of direct materials from a total of approximately 450 suppliers our top ten suppliers of direct materials combined represent approximately 50 of our total direct materials purchases the three most significant direct materials that we purchase are printed paper board used in packaging acetate tow used in filter making and fine paper used in cigarette manufacturing in addition the adequate supply and procurement of cloves are of particular importance to our indonesian business

risks related to our business and industry 

 this decline is due to multiple factors including increased taxes and pricing governmental actions the diminishing social acceptance of smoking continuing economic and geopolitical uncertainty and the continuing prevalence of illicit products these factors and their potential consequences are discussed more fully below and in item 7 business environment  

 tax regimes including excise taxes sales taxes and import duties can disproportionately affect the retail price of cigarettes versus other tobacco products or disproportionately affect the relative retail price of our cigarette brands versus cigarette brands manufactured by certain of our competitors because our portfolio is weighted toward the premiumprice cigarette category tax regimes based on sales price can place us at a competitive disadvantage in certain markets as a result our volume and profitability may be adversely affected in these markets 

increases in cigarette taxes are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on our sales of cigarettes due to resulting lower consumption levels a shift in sales from manufactured cigarettes to other tobacco products and from the premiumprice to the midprice or lowprice cigarette categories where we may be underrepresented from local sales to legal crossborder purchases of lower price products or to illicit products such as contraband counterfeit and illicit whites 

 governmental actions combined with the diminishing social acceptance of smoking and private actions to restrict smoking have resulted in reduced industry volume in many of our markets and we expect that such factors will continue to reduce consumption levels and will increase downtrading and the risk of counterfeiting contraband illicit whites and legal crossborder purchases significant regulatory developments will take place over the next few years in most of our markets driven principally by the world health organizations framework convention on tobacco control “fctc” the fctc is the first international public health treaty on tobacco and its objective is to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation the fctc has led to increased efforts by tobacco control advocates and public health organizations to promote increasingly restrictive regulatory measures on the marketing and sale of tobacco products to adult smokers regulatory initiatives that have been proposed introduced or enacted include 

 our operating income could be significantly affected by regulatory initiatives resulting in a significant decrease in demand for our brands in particular requirements that lead to a commoditization of tobacco products as well as any significant increase in the cost of complying with new regulatory requirements 

 7 

 

there is litigation related to tobacco products pending in certain jurisdictions damages claimed in some tobaccorelated litigation are significant and in certain cases in brazil canada and nigeria range into the billions of us dollars we anticipate that new cases will continue to be filed the fctc encourages litigation against tobacco product manufacturers it is possible that our consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation see item 3 legal proceedings  and item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 19 contingencies  for a discussion of pending litigation 

 we compete primarily on the basis of product quality brand recognition brand loyalty taste innovation packaging service marketing advertising and price we are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business the competitive environment and our competitive position can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions erosion of consumer confidence competitors introduction of lowerprice products or innovative products higher tobacco product taxes higher absolute prices and larger gaps between retail price categories and product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate tobacco products competitors include three large international tobacco companies and several regional and local tobacco companies and in some instances stateowned tobacco enterprises principally in algeria the prc egypt taiwan thailand and vietnam industry consolidation and privatizations of stateowned enterprises have led to an overall increase in competitive pressures some competitors have different profit and volume objectives and some international competitors are susceptible to changes in different currency exchange rates 

 some of the countries in which we operate face the threat of civil unrest and can be subject to regime changes in others nationalization terrorism conflict and the threat of war may have a significant impact on the business environment economic political regulatory or other developments or natural disasters could disrupt our supply chain manufacturing capabilities or distribution capabilities in addition such developments could lead to loss of property or equipment that are critical to our business in certain markets and difficulty in staffing and managing our operations which could reduce our volumes revenues and net earnings 

in certain markets we are dependent on governmental approvals of various actions such as price changes and failure to obtain such approvals could impair growth in our profitability 

in addition despite our high ethical standards and rigorous control and compliance procedures aimed at preventing and detecting unlawful conduct given the breadth and scope of our international operations we may not be able to detect all potential improper or unlawful conduct by our employees and international partners 

 our tobacco business is subject to changes in consumer preferences which may be influenced by local economic conditions to be successful we must 

 in periods of economic uncertainty consumers may tend to purchase lowerprice brands and the volume of our premiumprice and midprice brands and our profitability could suffer accordingly such downtrading trends may be reinforced by regulation that limits branding communication and product differentiation 

 8 

 large quantities of counterfeit cigarettes are sold in the international market we believe that marlboro  is the most heavily counterfeited international cigarette brand although we cannot quantify the revenues we lose as a result of this activity in addition our revenues are reduced by contraband legal crossborder purchases and nontaxpaid volume produced by local manufacturers 

 investigations include allegations of contraband shipments of cigarettes allegations of unlawful pricing activities within certain markets allegations of underpayment of customs duties andor excise taxes allegations of false and misleading usage of descriptors and allegations of unlawful advertising we cannot predict the outcome of those investigations or whether additional investigations may be commenced and it is possible that our business could be materially affected by an unfavorable outcome of pending or future investigations see item 3 legal proceedingsother litigation  and item 7 business environmentgovernmental investigations  for a description of certain governmental investigations to which we are subject 

 

our key strategic priorities are to develop and commercialize products that present less risk of harm to adult smokers who switch to those products versus continued smoking and to convince current adult smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke to switch to those rrps for our efforts to be successful we must develop rrps that such adult smokers find acceptable alternatives to smoking conduct rigorous scientific studies to substantiate that they reduce exposure to harmful and potentially harmful constituents in smoke and ultimately that these products present are likely to present or have the potential to present less risk of harm to adult smokers who switch to them versus continued smoking and effectively advocate for the development of sciencebased regulatory frameworks for the development and commercialization of rrps including communication of scientifically substantiated information to enable adult consumers to make better health choices we might not succeed in our efforts if we do not succeed but others do we may be at a competitive disadvantage furthermore we cannot predict whether regulators will permit the sale andor marketing of rrps with healthrelated claims such restrictions could limit the success of our rrps 

 we conduct our business primarily in local currency and for purposes of financial reporting the local currency results are translated into us dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period during times of a strengthening us dollar our reported net revenues and operating income will be reduced because the local currency translates into fewer us dollars during periods of local economic crises foreign currencies may be devalued significantly against the us dollar reducing our margins actions to recover margins may result in lower volume and a weaker competitive position 

 because we are a us holding company our most significant source of funds is distributions from our nonus subsidiaries under current us tax law in general we do not pay us taxes on our foreign earnings until they are repatriated to the us as distributions from our nonus subsidiaries these distributions may result in a residual us tax cost it may be advantageous to us in certain circumstances to significantly increase the amount of such distributions which could result in a material increase in our overall effective tax rate under current us tax law furthermore our effective tax rate could be increased due to changes in the earnings mix or applicable tax laws in addition certain countries in which we operate have adopted or could institute currency exchange controls that limit or prohibit our local subsidiaries ability to convert local currency into us dollars or to make payments outside the country this could subject us to the risks of local currency devaluation and business disruption 

 our profit growth may suffer if we are unable to introduce new products or enter new markets successfully to raise prices or to improve the proportion of our sales of higher margin products and in higher margin geographies 

 9 

 one element of our growth strategy is to strengthen our brand portfolio and market positions through selective acquisitions and the development of strategic business relationships acquisition and strategic business development opportunities are limited and present risks of failing to achieve efficient and effective integration strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings there is no assurance that we will be able to acquire attractive businesses on favorable terms or that future acquisitions or strategic business developments will be accretive to earnings 

 as with other agricultural commodities the price of tobacco leaf and cloves can be influenced by imbalances in supply and demand and crop quality can be influenced by variations in weather patterns including those caused by climate change tobacco production in certain countries is subject to a variety of controls including government mandated prices and production control programs changes in the patterns of demand for agricultural products could cause farmers to plant less tobacco any significant change in tobacco leaf and clove prices quality and quantity could affect our profitability and our business 

 

the tobacco industry competes for talent with consumer products and other companies that enjoy greater societal acceptance as a result we may be unable to attract and retain the best global talent 

 we use information systems to help manage business processes collect and interpret business data and communicate internally and externally with employees suppliers customers and others some of these information systems are managed by thirdparty service providers we have backup systems and business continuity plans in place and we take care to protect our systems and data from unauthorized access nevertheless failure of our systems to function as intended or penetration of our systems by outside parties intent on extracting or corrupting information or otherwise disrupting business processes could place us at a competitive disadvantage result in a loss of revenue assets or personal or other sensitive data litigation and regulatory action cause damage to our reputation and that of our brands and result in significant remediation and other costs to us 

 

in certain instances we contract with third parties to manufacture some of our products or product parts or to provide other services we may be unable to renew these agreements on satisfactory terms for numerous reasons including government regulations accordingly our costs may increase significantly if we must replace such third parties with our own resources

legal proceedings 

tableend   

tobaccorelated litigation 

  

legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened against us andor our subsidiaries andor our indemnitees in various jurisdictions our indemnitees include distributors licensees and others that have been named as parties in certain cases and that we have agreed to defend as well as to pay costs and some or all of judgments if any that may be entered against them pursuant to the terms of the distribution agreement between altria group inc altria and pmi pmi will indemnify altria and philip morris usa inc pm usa a us tobacco subsidiary of altria for tobacco product claims based in substantial part on products manufactured by pmi or contract manufactured for pmi by pm usa and pm usa will indemnify pmi for tobacco product claims based in substantial part on products manufactured by pm usa excluding tobacco products contract manufactured for pmi 

it is possible that there could be adverse developments in pending cases against us and our subsidiaries an unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobaccorelated litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation 

damages claimed in some of the tobaccorelated litigation are significant and in certain cases in brazil canada and nigeria range into the billions of us dollars the variability in pleadings in multiple jurisdictions together with the actual experience of management in litigating claims demonstrate that the monetary relief that may be specified in a lawsuit bears little relevance to the ultimate outcome much of the tobaccorelated litigation is in its early stages and litigation is subject to uncertainty however as discussed below we have to date been largely successful in defending tobaccorelated litigation 

we and our subsidiaries record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated at the present time while it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur after assessing the information available to it i management has not concluded that it is probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending tobaccorelated cases ii management is unable to estimate the 

 11 

possible loss or range of loss for any of the pending tobaccorelated cases and iii accordingly no estimated loss has been accrued in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes in these cases if any legal defense costs are expensed as incurred 

it is possible that our consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation nevertheless although litigation is subject to uncertainty we and each of our subsidiaries named as a defendant believe and each has been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases that we have valid defenses to the litigation pending against us as well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts all such cases are and will continue to be vigorously defended however we and our subsidiaries may enter into settlement discussions in particular cases if we believe it is in our best interests to do so 

to date no tobaccorelated case has been finally resolved in favor of a plaintiff against us our subsidiaries or indemnitees 

the table below lists the number of tobaccorelated cases pending against us andor our subsidiaries or indemnitees as of february 10 2017 december 31 2015 and december 31 2014 

  



since 1995 when the first tobaccorelated litigation was filed against a pmi entity 456 smoking and health lights health care cost recovery and public civil actions in which we andor one of our subsidiaries andor indemnitees were a defendant have been terminated in our favor thirteen cases have had decisions in favor of plaintiffs nine of these cases have subsequently reached final resolution in our favor and four remain on appeal

pending claims related to tobacco products generally fall within the following categories 

smoking and health litigation  these cases primarily allege personal injury and are brought by individual plaintiffs or on behalf of a class or purported class of individual plaintiffs plaintiffs allegations of liability in these cases are based on various theories of recovery including negligence gross negligence strict liability fraud misrepresentation design defect failure to warn breach of express and implied warranties violations of deceptive trade practice laws and consumer protection statutes plaintiffs in these cases seek various forms of relief including compensatory and other damages and injunctive and equitable relief defenses raised in these cases include licit activity failure to state a claim lack of defect lack of proximate cause assumption of the risk contributory negligence and statute of limitations 

as of february 10 2017 there were a number of smoking and health cases pending against us our subsidiaries or indemnitees as follows 

 

in the first class action pending in brazil the smoker health defense association adesf v souza cruz sa and philip morris marketing sa nineteenth lower civil court of the central courts of the judiciary district of são paulo brazil  filed july 25 1995 our subsidiary and another member of the industry are defendants the plaintiff a consumer organization is seeking damages for all addicted smokers and former smokers and injunctive relief in 2004 the trial court found defendants liable without hearing evidence and awarded “moral damages” of r1000 approximately 321 per smoker per full year of smoking plus interest at the rate of 1 per month as of the date of the ruling the court did not award actual damages which were to be assessed in the second phase of the case the size of the class was not estimated defendants appealed to the são paulo court of appeals which annulled the ruling in november 2008 finding that the trial court had inappropriately ruled without hearing evidence and returned the case to the trial court for further proceedings in may 2011 the trial court dismissed the claim in february 2015 the appellate court unanimously dismissed plaintiffs appeal in september 2015 plaintiff appealed to the superior court of justice in addition the defendants filed a constitutional appeal to the federal supreme tribunal on the basis that plaintiff did not have standing to bring the lawsuit both appeals are still pending

 15 

pending the court further stated that these cases should be consolidated for the purposes of judgment in april 2010 the são paulo court of appeals reversed the seventh civil courts decision that consolidated the cases finding that they are based on different legal claims and are progressing at different stages of proceedings this case was returned to the seventh civil court of são paulo and our subsidiary filed its closing arguments in december 2010 in march 2012 the trial court dismissed the case on the merits in january 2014 the são paulo court of appeals rejected plaintiff’s appeal and affirmed the trial court decision in july 2014 plaintiff appealed to the superior court of justice

our products are sold in more than 180 markets and in many of these markets they hold the number one or number two market share position we have a wide range of premium midprice and lowprice brands our   portfolio comprises both international and local brands in addition to the manufacture and sale of cigarettes and other tobacco products we are engaged in the development and commercialization of reducedrisk products rrps rrps is the term we use to refer to products that present are likely to present or have the potential to present less risk of harm to smokers who switch to these products versus continued smoking we have a range of rrps in various stages of development scientific assessment and commercialization because our rrps do not burn tobacco they produce far lower quantities of harmful and potentially harmful compounds than found in cigarette smoke 

we use the term net revenues to refer to our operating revenues from the sale of our products net of sales and promotion incentives our net revenues and operating income are affected by various factors including the volume of products we sell the price of our products changes in currency exchange rates and the mix of products we sell mix is a term used to refer to the proportionate value of premiumprice brands to midprice or lowprice brands in any given market product mix mix can also refer to the proportion of shipment volume in more profitable markets versus shipment volume in less profitable markets geographic mix we often collect excise taxes from our customers and then remit them to governments and in those circumstances we include the excise taxes in our net revenues and in excise taxes on products our cost of sales consists principally of tobacco leaf nontobacco raw materials labor and manufacturing costs

marketing administration and research costs 

for further details see the consolidated operating results  and operating results by business segment  sections of the following discussion and analysis  

• 2017 forecasted results –  on february 2 2017 we announced our forecast for 2017 fullyear reported diluted eps to be in a range of 470 to 485 at prevailing exchange rates at that time versus 448  in 2016 excluding an unfavorable currency impact at thenprevailing exchange rates of approximately 018 per share for the fullyear 2017 the reported diluted earnings per share range represents an increase of approximately 9 to 12 versus adjusted diluted earnings per share of 448  in 2016 this forecast reflects net revenue growth excluding excise taxes in excess of our current annual growth target range of 46 excluding currency and acquisitions this forecast does not include any share repurchases in 2017 

our 2016  reported and adjusted diluted eps was 448  during 2016  we did not have an eps impact related to asset impairment and exit costs and discrete tax items 

adjusted diluted eps is not a measure under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap we define adjusted diluted eps as reported diluted eps adjusted for asset impairment and exit costs discrete tax items and unusual items we believe it is appropriate to disclose this measure as it represents core earnings improves comparability and helps investors analyze business performance and trends adjusted diluted eps should be considered neither in isolation nor as a substitute for reported diluted eps prepared in accordance with us gaap 

this 2017 guidance excludes the impact of any future acquisitions unanticipated asset impairment and exit cost charges future changes in currency exchange rates and any unusual events the factors described in item 1a risk factors represent continuing risks to this forecast 

discussion and analysis 

critical accounting estimates 

item 8 note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in most instances we must use a particular accounting policy or method because it is the only one that is permitted under us gaap 

the preparation of financial statements requires that we use estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets liabilities net revenues and expenses as well as our disclosure of contingencies if actual amounts differ from previous estimates we include the revisions in our consolidated results of operations in the period during which we know the actual amounts historically aggregate differences if any between our estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 

the selection and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates have been discussed with our audit committee the following is a discussion of the more significant assumptions estimates accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

• revenue recognition   we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery of product has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured for our company this means that revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss is transferred to our customers title transfers to our customers upon shipment or upon receipt at the customers location as determined by the sales terms for each transaction the company estimates the cost of sales returns based on historical experience and these estimates are immaterial 

• goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets valuation  we test goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events occur that would warrant such review during the second quarter of 2016 we changed the date of our annual goodwill impairment test from the first quarter to the second quarter the change was made to more closely align the impairment testing date with our longrange planning and forecasting process we have determined that this change in accounting principle is preferable under the circumstances and believe that the change in the annual impairment testing date did not delay accelerate or avoid an impairment charge while the company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment for both goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets to determine if it is more likely than not that an impairment exists the company elects to perform the quantitative assessment for our annual impairment analysis the impairment analysis involves comparing the fair value of each reporting 

 28 

unit or nonamortizable intangible asset to the carrying value if the carrying value exceeds the fair value goodwill or a nonamortizable intangible asset is considered impaired to determine the fair value of goodwill we primarily use a discounted cash flow model supported by the market approach using earnings multiples of comparable global and local companies within the tobacco industry at december 31 2016  the carrying value of our goodwill was 73 billion  which is related to ten reporting units each of which consists of a group of markets with similar economic characteristics the estimated fair value of each of our ten reporting units exceeded the carrying value as of december 31 2016  to determine the fair value of nonamortizable intangible assets we primarily use a discounted cash flow model applying the relieffromroyalty method we concluded that the fair value of our nonamortizable intangible assets exceeded the carrying value   these discounted cash flow models include management assumptions relevant for forecasting operating cash flows which are subject to changes in business conditions such as volumes and prices costs to produce discount rates and estimated capital needs management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the fair values are estimated and we believe these assumptions are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use since the march 28 2008 spinoff from altria we have not recorded a charge to earnings for an impairment of goodwill or nonamortizable intangible assets 

• marketing and advertising costs   we incur certain costs to support our products through programs that include advertising marketing consumer engagement and trade promotions the costs of our advertising and marketing programs are expensed in accordance with us gaap recognition of the cost related to our consumer engagement and trade promotion programs contain uncertainties due to the judgment required in estimating the potential performance and compliance for each program for volumebased incentives provided to customers management continually assesses and estimates by customer the likelihood of the customers achieving the specified targets and records the reduction of revenue as the sales are made for other trade promotions management relies on estimated utilization rates that have been developed from historical experience changes in the assumptions used in estimating the cost of any individual marketing program would not result in a material change in our financial position results of operations or operating cash flows we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to estimate our marketing programs during the past three years 

• employee benefit plans  as discussed in item 8 note 13 benefit plans  to our consolidated financial statements we provide a range of benefits to our employees and retired employees including pensions postretirement health care and postemployment benefits primarily severance we record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by us gaap these calculations include various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates assumed rates of return on plan assets compensation increases mortality turnover rates and health care cost trend rates we review actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so as permitted by us gaap any effect of the modifications is generally amortized over future periods we believe that the assumptions utilized in calculating our obligations under these plans are reasonable based upon our historical experience and advice from our actuaries 

weightedaverage discount rate assumptions for pensions and postretirement plans are as follows 



we anticipate that assumption changes will decrease 2017 pretax us and nonus pension and postretirement expense to approximately 199 million as compared with approximately 215 million in 2016 excluding amounts related to early retirement programs the anticipated decrease is primarily due to lower interest cost partially offset by lower expected return on assets 

weightedaverage expected rate of return and discount rate assumptions have a significant effect on the amount of expense reported for the employee benefit plans a fiftybasispoint decrease in our discount rate would increase our 2017 pension and postretirement expense by approximately 43 million and a fiftybasispoint increase in our discount rate would decrease our 2017 pension and postretirement expense by approximately 40 million similarly a fiftybasispoint decrease increase in the expected return on plan assets would increase decrease our 2017 pension expense by approximately 33 million see item 8 note 13 benefit plans  to our consolidated financial statements for a sensitivity discussion of the assumed health care cost trend rates 

beginning january 1 2017 we changed the method used to calculate the service and interest cost components for the net periodic pension benefit costs specifically service costs will be determined based on durationspecific spot rates applied to service cost cash flows and interest costs will be determined by applying duration specific spot rates to the yearbyyear projected benefit the change will not have a material impact to our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows and will be accounted for prospectively as a change in accounting estimate 

• income taxes   income tax provisions for jurisdictions outside the united states as well as state and local income tax provisions are determined on a separate company basis and the related assets and liabilities are recorded in our consolidated balance sheets

the extent of our operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions the final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal state and international tax audits in accordance with the authoritative guidance for income taxes we evaluate potential tax exposures and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment an additional charge to expense would result if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 

the effective tax rates used for interim reporting are based on our fullyear geographic earnings mix projections and cash repatriation plans changes in currency exchange rates earnings mix by taxing jurisdiction or in cash repatriation plans could have an impact on the effective tax rates which we monitor each quarter significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions 

for further details see item 8 note 11 income taxes  to our consolidated financial statements 

• hedging  as discussed below in “market risk” we use derivative financial instruments principally to reduce exposures to market risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates by creating offsetting exposures for derivatives to which we have elected to apply hedge accounting gains and losses on these derivatives are initially deferred in accumulated other comprehensive losses on the consolidated balance sheet and recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings in the periods when the related hedged transactions are also recognized in operating results if we had elected not to use the hedge accounting provisions gains losses deferred in stockholders’ deficit equity would have been recorded in our net earnings for these derivatives 

• contingencies  as   discussed in item 8 note 19 contingencies  to our consolidated financial statements legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened against us andor our subsidiaries andor our indemnitees in various jurisdictions we and our subsidiaries record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated the variability in pleadings in multiple jurisdictions together with the actual experience of management in litigating claims demonstrate that the monetary relief that may be specified in a lawsuit bears little relevance to the ultimate outcome much of the tobaccorelated litigation is in its early stages and litigation is subject to uncertainty at the present time while it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur after assessing the information available to it i management has not concluded that it is probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending tobaccorelated cases ii management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss for any of the pending tobaccorelated cases and iii accordingly no estimated loss has been accrued in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes in these cases if any legal defense costs are expensed as incurred

the following discussion compares our consolidated operating results for the year ended december 31 2016  with the year ended december 31 2015  

our cigarette shipment volume decreased  by 41  or by 47  excluding net estimated inventory movements due to 

 

our cigarette market share increased in a number of markets including brazil canada colombia the czech republic france kuwait mexico the netherlands norway poland saudi arabia spain switzerland turkey and the united arab emirates

our cigarette shipment volume by brand is shown in the table below 



cigarette shipment volume of marlboro   decreased  driven by algeria argentina egypt and vietnam as well as inswitching from that brand to  iqos  consumables partly offset by korea mexico the philippines saudi arabia and spain 

cigarette shipment volume of lm   decreased  notably in russia thailand and turkey partly offset by algeria kazakhstan and ukraine cigarette shipment volume of parliament   increased  mainly driven by korea turkey and ukraine partly offset by japan and russia cigarette shipment volume of bond street   increased  mainly driven by ukraine partly offset by kazakhstan cigarette shipment volume of chesterfield   increased  mainly driven by argentina the czech republic reflecting the morphing of red  white  turkey and the united kingdom partly offset by russia cigarette shipment volume of philip morris   increased  driven mainly by italy and russia partly offset by argentina cigarette shipment volume of lark   decreased  principally due to japan and turkey cigarette shipment volume of others decreased  mainly due to local largely lowmargin brands in pakistan the philippines russia and ukraine 

our other tobacco products otp primarily include tobacco for rollyourown and makeyourown cigarettes pipe tobacco cigars and cigarillos and do not include reducedrisk products total shipment volume of otp in cigarette equivalent units decreased  by 45  to 326 billion  units 

total shipment volume for cigarettes and otp in cigarette equivalent units decreased  by 41  

total shipment volume of iqos  consumables reached 74 billion  units up from 396 million  units in 2015  

our net revenues and excise taxes on products were as follows 



net revenues which include excise taxes billed to customers increased  by 10 billion  excluding excise taxes net revenues decreased  by 109 million  due to 

 

 33 

the unfavorable currency was due primarily to the argentine peso canadian dollar egyptian pound euro kazakh tenge mexican peso philippine peso russian ruble and turkish lira partially offset by the japanese yen 

  

net revenues include 739 million  in 2016  related to sale of rrps mainly driven by japan this amount includes excise taxes billed to customers excluding excise taxes net revenues for rrps were 733 million  in 2016     in some jurisdictions including japan we are not responsible for collecting excise taxes approximately 22 of our 733 million in 2016 rrp net revenues excluding excise taxes were from iqos  devices 

net revenues related to rrps represent the sale of heatnotburn consumables including iqos  consumables iqos  devices and related accessories and other nicotinecontaining products primarily evapor products net of sales and promotion incentives 

net revenues include 18 billion  in 2016  and 2015  related to sales of otp these net revenue amounts include excise taxes billed to customers excluding excises taxes net revenues for otp were 644 million  in 2016  and 673 million  in 2015  

excise taxes on products increased  by 12 billion  due to 

 

governments have consistently increased excise taxes in most of the markets in which we operate as discussed in business environment  we expect excise taxes to continue to increase 

our cost of sales marketing administration and research costs and operating income were as follows

operating income increased  by 192 million  due primarily to 

 

 34 

interest expense net of 891 million   decreased  by 117 million  due primarily to lower effective interest rates on debt and higher interest income 

our effective tax rate decreased  by 01  percentage point to 279  the 2015 effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by changes to repatriation assertions on certain foreign subsidiary historical earnings 58 million partially offset by a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits of 41 million following the conclusion of the irs examinations of altrias consolidated tax returns for the years 2007 and 2008 and pmis consolidated tax returns for the years 2009 through 2011 prior to march 28 2008 pmi was a wholly owned subsidiary of altria changes in currency exchange rates earnings mix by taxing jurisdiction or in our cash repatriation plans could have an impact on the effective tax rate which we monitor each quarter significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions based upon tax regulations in existence at december 31 2016  and our cash repatriation plans we estimate that our 2017 effective tax rate will be approximately 28  

we are regularly examined by tax authorities around the world and we are currently under examination in a number of jurisdictions it is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months certain tax examinations will close which could result in a change in unrecognized tax benefits along with related interest and penalties an estimate of any possible charge cannot be made at this time 

net earnings attributable to pmi of 70 billion   increased  by 94 million   14  this increase  was due primarily to higher operating income as discussed above and lower interest expense net diluted and basic eps of 448   increased  by 14  excluding an unfavorable currency impact of 046  diluted eps increased by 118  

2015  compared with 2014

operating results by business segment 

business environment 

taxes legislation regulation and other matters regarding the manufacture marketing sale and use of tobacco products 

the tobacco industry and our business face a number of challenges that may adversely affect our business volume results of operations cash flows and financial position these challenges which are discussed below and in “ cautionary factors that may affect future results ” include 

 

regulatory restrictions  the tobacco industry operates in a highly regulated environment the wellknown risks of smoking have led regulators to impose significant restrictions and high excise taxes on cigarettes 

we support a comprehensive regulatory framework for tobacco products based on the principle of harm reduction including mandated health warnings minimum age laws restrictions on advertising and public place smoking restrictions we also support regulatory measures that help reduce illicit trade 

much of the regulation that shapes the business environment in which we operate is driven by the world health organizations “who” framework convention on tobacco control “fctc” which entered into force in 2005 the fctc is the first international public health treaty and has as its main objective to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation with the purpose of reducing tobacco use to date 179 countries and the european union are parties to the fctc the treaty requires parties to have in place various tobacco control measures and recommends others the fctc governing body the conference of the parties “cop” has also adopted nonbinding guidelines and policy recommendations related to certain articles of the fctc that go beyond the text of the treaty 

we have opposed certain measures and continue to engage in a dialogue with regulators with respect to those measures that we do not believe would protect public health and if implemented could disrupt competition severely limit our ability to market and sell our products to adult smokers or increase illicit trade certain measures are discussed in more detail below it is not possible to predict whether or to what extent measures recommended in the fctc guidelines will be implemented 

 38 

fiscal challenges  excessive and disruptive excise sales and other tax increases and discriminatory tax structures are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on our profitability due to lower consumption and consumer downtrading to nonpremium discount other lowprice or lowtaxed tobacco products such as fine cut tobacco and illicit products in addition in certain jurisdictions our combustible products mainly cigarettes are subject to tax structures that discriminate against premiumprice products and manufactured cigarettes we believe that such tax policies undermine public health by encouraging consumers to turn to the illicit trade for cheaper tobacco products and ultimately undercut government revenue objectives disrupt the competitive environment and encourage criminal activity other jurisdictions have imposed or are seeking to impose levies or other taxes specifically on tobacco companies such as taxes on revenues andor profits 

eu tobacco products directive  in april 2014 the eu adopted the text of a significantly revised eu tobacco products directive tpd which entered into force in may 2016 to date 23 member states and norway have adopted laws transposing the tpd while the remaining ones are concluding the national transposition the tpd sets forth a comprehensive set of regulatory requirements for tobacco products including 

 

plain packaging and other packaging restrictions  plain packaging legislation bans the use of branding logos and colors on packaging other than the brand name and variant that may be printed only in specified locations and in a uniform font to date australia france hungary ireland new zealand norway and the uk have adopted plain packaging legislation in australia plain packaging has been implemented since december 2012 in france plain packaging has been fully implemented since january 2017 and in the uk full compliance is required as of may 2017 in hungary full compliance is required immediately for new product launches and no later than may 2019 for other products no implementation date has yet been set in new zealand norway or ireland 

several countries have initiated world trade organization wto dispute settlement proceedings against australia related to australias plain packaging legislation the matter is still pending before the wto panel in may 2015 three of our subsidiaries filed papers in the english high court seeking judicial review of the uk’s plain packaging legislation in may 2016 the court issued a judgment rejecting our claims as well as those from other tobacco companies we chose not to appeal the decision in december 2016 the conseil d’etat in france upheld the decree that implements france’s plain packaging legislation 

other countries are also considering adopting plain packaging legislation including but not limited to canada turkey and singapore 

some countries have adopted or are considering adopting packaging restrictions that could have an impact similar to plain packaging examples of such restrictions include standardizing the shape and size of packages prohibiting certain colors or the use of certain descriptive phrases on packaging and requiring very large graphic health warnings that leave little space for branding 

restrictions and bans on the use of ingredients  the who and others in the public health community have recommended restrictions or total bans on the use of some or all ingredients in tobacco products including menthol broad restrictions and ingredient bans would require us to reformulate our american blend tobacco products and could reduce our ability to differentiate these products in the market in the long term menthol bans would eliminate the entire category of mentholated tobacco products the european union has banned flavored tobacco products subject to an exemption until may 2020 for menthol other countries may follow the eu’s approach for instance turkey has banned menthol as of may 2020 more sweeping ingredient bans have been adopted by canada and brazil while the canadian ingredient ban currently exempts menthol at the national level the majority of canadian provinces have adopted or are in the process of adopting menthol bans the canadian federal government also recently published draft regulations that would prohibit menthol in cigarettes the brazil ingredients ban which would prohibit the use of virtually all ingredients with flavoring or aromatic properties is not in force due to a legal challenge by a tobacco industry union of which our brazilian subsidiary is a member other lawsuits are also pending against the brazil ingredients ban it is not possible to predict the outcome of these legal proceedings 

 39 

bans on display of tobacco products at retail  in a number of our markets including but not limited to australia canada norway russia and singapore governments have banned the display of tobacco products at the point of sale other countries are also considering similar bans 

bans and restrictions on advertising marketing promotions and sponsorships  for many years the fctc has called for and countries have imposed partial or total bans on tobacco advertising marketing promotions and sponsorships including bans and restrictions on advertising on radio and television in print and on the internet the fctc guidelines recommend that governments prohibit all forms of communication with adult smokers 

restrictions on product design   some members of the public health community are calling for the further standardization of tobacco products by requiring for example that cigarettes have a certain minimum diameter which would amount to a ban on slim cigarettes or requiring the use of standardized filter and cigarette paper designs in addition at its meeting in november 2016 the cop adopted nonbinding guidelines recommending that countries regulate product design features that increase the attractiveness of tobacco products such as the diameter of cigarettes and the use of flavor capsules reduced cigarette ignition propensity “rcip” standards previously recommended by the fctc guidelines have been adopted in several of our markets eg australia canada south africa south korea and the eu and are being considered in others 

restrictions on public smoking  the pace and scope of public smoking restrictions have increased significantly in most of our markets many countries around the world have adopted or are likely to adopt regulations that restrict or ban smoking in public andor work places restaurants bars and nightclubs some public health groups have called for and some countries regional governments and municipalities have adopted or proposed bans on smoking in outdoor places as well as bans on smoking in cars typically when minors are present and private homes 

other regulatory issues  some regulators are considering or in some cases have adopted regulatory measures designed to reduce the supply of tobacco products these include regulations intended to reduce the number of retailers selling tobacco by for example reducing the overall number of tobacco retail licenses available or banning the sale of tobacco within arbitrary distances of certain public facilities 

in a limited number of markets most notably japan we are dependent on governmental approvals that may limit our pricing flexibility 

illicit trade  the illicit tobacco trade creates a cheap and unregulated supply of tobacco products undermines efforts to reduce smoking especially among youth damages legitimate businesses stimulates organized crime increases corruption and reduces government tax revenue illicit trade may account for as much as 10 of global cigarette consumption this includes counterfeit contraband and the growing problem of “illicit whites” which are cigarettes legally produced in one jurisdiction for the sole purpose of being exported and illegally sold in another jurisdiction where they have no legitimate market we estimate that illicit trade in the european union accounted for slightly less than 10 of total cigarette consumption in 2016 

a number of jurisdictions are considering actions to prevent illicit trade in november 2012 the fctc adopted the protocol to eliminate illicit trade in tobacco products the “protocol” which includes supply chain control measures such as licensing of manufacturers and distributors enforcement in free trade zones controls on duty free and internet sales and the implementation of tracking and tracing technologies to date 54 countries have signed the protocol and 24 countries and the european union have ratified it the protocol will come into force once the fortieth country ratifies it after which countries must implement its measures via national legislation we expect and welcome that other countries will ratify the protocol 

we and our subsidiaries have entered into cooperation agreements with governments and authorities to support their antiillicit trade efforts in 2004 we entered into a cooperation agreement with the eu and its member states that provided for cooperation with european law enforcement agencies on anticontraband and on anticounterfeit efforts under the terms of this agreement we made financial contributions of approximately 75 million per year to support these efforts the eu commission decided not to renew the agreement which expired in july 2016 

in 2009 our colombian subsidiaries entered into an investment and cooperation agreement with the national and regional governments of colombia to promote investment in and cooperation on anticontraband and anticounterfeit efforts the agreement provides 200 million in funding over a 20year period to address issues such as combating the illegal cigarette trade and increasing the quality and quantity of locally grown tobacco 

in may 2016 pmi launched pmi impact a new global initiative that supports thirdparty projects dedicated to fighting illegal trade and related crimes such as corruption organized criminal networks and money laundering the centerpiece of pmi impact is a council of external independent experts with impeccable credentials in the fields of law anticorruption and law enforcement the experts are 

 40 

responsible for evaluating and approving funding proposals for pmi impact grants pmi has pledged 100 million to fund projects within pmi impact during a threeyear period we expect that the first round of grants will be awarded in the second quarter of 2017 

in november 2016 pmi signed a joint declaration of intent to prevent the maritime transportation of counterfeit goods together with eight other global brand owners and five of the world’s largest shipping companies this commitment was a result of a dialogue with the international chamber of commerce’s business action to stop counterfeiting and piracy the signatories aim to tackle the infiltration of shipping services by criminal networks that exploit vessels to transport counterfeit goods including “illicit whites” across the oceans 

reducedrisk products   

our approach to rrps   we recognize that smoking cigarettes causes serious diseases and that the best way to avoid the harms of smoking is never to start or to quit nevertheless it is predicted that over the next decade the number of smokers will remain largely unchanged from the current estimate of 11 billion despite the considerable efforts to discourage smoking 

cigarettes burn tobacco which produces smoke as a result of the combustion process the smoker inhales various toxic substances in contrast reducedrisk products do not burn tobacco and produce significantly lower levels of harmful or potentially harmful compounds than found in smoke 

for smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke we believe that rrps offer a much better choice accordingly our key strategic priorities are to develop and commercialize products that present less risk of harm to adult smokers who switch to those products versus continued smoking and to convince current adult smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke to switch to those reducedrisk products 

we recognize that this transformation from cigarettes to rrps will take time and that the speed of transformation will depend in part upon factors beyond our control such as the willingness of governments regulators and other policy groups to embrace rrps as a desired solution to the smoking problem we also recognize that the transformation must be funded from our existing cigarette business for so long as a significant number continues to smoke it is critical that the industry be led by responsible and ethical manufacturers therefore during the transformation we intend to remain the leading international cigarette manufacturer 

we have a range of rrps in various stages of development scientific assessment and commercialization we conduct rigorous scientific assessment of our rrp platforms to establish that they reduce exposure to harmful and potentially harmful constituents in smoke and ultimately that these products present are likely to present or have the potential to present less risk of harm to adult smokers who switch to them versus continued smoking we draw upon a team of expert scientists and engineers from a broad spectrum of scientific disciplines and our extensive learnings of consumer preferences to develop and assess our rrps our efforts are guided by the following key objectives 

 

our rrp platforms   our product development is based on the elimination of combustion via tobacco heating and other innovative systems for aerosol generation which we believe is the most promising path to providing a better choice for those who would otherwise continue to smoke we recognize that no single product will appeal to all adult smokers therefore we are developing a portfolio of products intended to appeal to a variety of distinct tastes 

four rrp platforms are in various stages of development and commercialization readiness 

  platform 1  uses a precisely controlled heating device that we are commercializing under the iqos  brand name into which a specially designed and proprietary consumable tobacco product “ iqos  consumables” is inserted and heated to generate an aerosol eight clinical studies have been completed including two with the duration of three months the study results show a substantial reduction in relevant biomarkers of exposure to harmful or potentially harmful constituents “hphcs” in those adult smokers who switched to iqos  compared to those who continued to smoke cigarettes for the duration of the study the reductions measured in those 

 41 

who switched to iqos  approached those that were observed in study participants who quit smoking for the duration of the study while these reduced exposure clinical studies were primarily designed to focus on biomarkers of exposure in our threemonth studies we also measured six clinical risk markers these clinical risk markers are associated with disease mechanisms known to be affected by smoking and to reverse upon cessation the results are generally consistent with the expected direction of change and indicate that switching completely to iqos  led to an overall improvement of clinical risk markers affected by smoking after only three months we also initiated a 66 month exposure response study in december 2014 and expect the results regarding the first sixmonth term in the third quarter of 2017 we have developed a new version of  iqos  to further improve the consumer experience and plan to introduce this new version in the second quarter of 2017 

  platform 2  uses a pressed carbon heat source which when ignited generates an aerosol by heating tobacco a pharmacokinetic study and a fiveday reducedexposure study with platform 2  have now been completed in the pharmacokinetic study we observed that the nicotine pharmacokinetic profile and the subjective user satisfaction are comparable to smoking cigarettes indicating that this platform could be an acceptable substitute for adult smokers who want to continue to use tobacco products but seek an alternative to cigarettes the results of the reduced exposure study show a substantial reduction in relevant biomarkers of exposure to hphcs in those who switched to platform 2 compared to those who continued to smoke cigarettes over a fiveday period the clinical phase of a threemonth reducedexposure study has also been completed we expect the results to be reported in 2017 

  platform 3  creates an aerosol of nicotine salt formed by the chemical reaction of nicotine with a weak organic acid we are exploring two routes for this platform one with electronics and one without we have begun preclinical and clinical testing of this platform including a pharmacokinetic study in new zealand for the electronic version the study assessed this products nicotine pharmacokinetic profile in comparison to a nicotine inhalator the study showed that nicotine absorption with this product reached peak levels six times faster than with the inhalator in line with the pharmacokinetic profile of a cigarette suggesting a significantly higher potential for acceptance by smokers we have also completed the clinical phase of a pharmacodynamics study in the us and expect final results for this study in the first half of 2017 we expect to commence a safety and efficacy study in the first half of 2017 

  platform 4  covers evapor products which are batterypowered devices that produce an aerosol by vaporizing a liquid nicotine solution our evapor products comprise devices using current generation technology and we are well advanced in the development and commercialization of our next generation of evapor technology mesh  which addresses certain challenges presented by some evapor products currently on the market our mesh products are designed to ensure the consistency and quality of the generated aerosol we have commenced nonclinical studies and our planned clinical assessment includes a pharmacokinetic study scheduled to start in 2017 and a reducedexposure study that we expect to start in 2018 

we are also developing other potential product platforms 

commercialization of rrps   in 2014 we introduced the iqos  system in pilot city launches in nagoya japan and in milan italy since then we have expanded our commercialization activities to include all of japan as well as multiple cities in italy we also launched iqos  in various cities in switzerland russia romania ukraine portugal germany new zealand canada and other markets by the end of december 2016 iqos was available for sale nationwide in japan and in key cities in 20 markets and approximately 14 million adult smokers had converted to   it we expect to expand iqos nationally   in many of these markets in 2017 as iqos  consumables capacity increases we are also targeting launches of iqos  in key cities in an additional ten to fifteen markets by the end of 2017 as capacity permits 

on the basis of our experience in japan and italy we estimate that only a very small percentage of adult smokers who fully convert to iqos  switch back to cigarettes 

in the first quarter of 2016 we started broad commercial production of  iqos  consumables to date we have experienced supply shortages resulting from strongerthananticipated demand primarily in japan and expect capacity limitations to ease as 2017 unfolds our 2016 yearend installed capacity was approximately 15 billion iqos  consumables and we expect that our 2017 yearend installed iqos  consumables capacity will reach approximately 50 billion units this installed capacity is expected to allow us to produce approximately 32 billion units in 2017 up from 7 billion in 2016 we estimate that as of 2018 we can increase installed annual capacity as needed by approximately four billion units per month with a lead time of 12 months 

as a result of the supply shortages of iqos  consumables in june 2016 we began to limit the sale of our iqos  devices in japan while we currently have sufficient capacity with respect to iqos devices we plan to expand our supplier base our iqos  devices are subject to product warranties for a period of 12 months from the date of purchase or such other periods as required by law warranty claims for these devices have not had a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows in any of the periods presented although they may become more significant as the number of units sold increases 

 42 

we currently market our evapor products in several markets including the united kingdom spain and israel in november 2016 we began the city test of mesh  our platform 4 product in birmingham united kingdom we also expect to conduct city tests of our platform 2 and platform 3 products in 2017 

rrp regulation and taxation  rrps contain nicotine and are not riskfree we therefore support sciencebased regulation and taxation of rrps regulation and taxation should differentiate between cigarettes and products that present are likely to present or have the potential to present less risk of harm to adult smokers who switch to these products versus continued smoking regulation should provide minimum standards for rrps and specific rules for among other things ingredients labelling and consumer communication and should ensure that the public is informed about the health risks of all tobacco and nicotinecontaining products regulation as well as tobacco industry activities should reflect the fact that youth should not consume nicotine in any form 

some governments have banned or are seeking to ban or severely restrict emerging tobacco and nicotinecontaining products such as our rrps these regulations might foreclose or unreasonably restrict consumer access even to products that might be shown to be a better health choice than continuing to smoke we oppose such blanket bans and unreasonable restrictions of products that have the potential to present less risk of harm compared to continued smoking by contrast we support regulation that sets clear standards and propels innovation to benefit adult smokers 

in the united states an established regulatory framework for assessing “modified risk tobacco products” and “new tobacco products” exists under the jurisdiction of the food and drug administration “fda” future fda actions may influence the regulatory approach of other interested governments in december 2016 we submitted a modified risk tobacco product application for platform 1 to the fda we plan to submit a premarket tobacco application in the first quarter of 2017 for platform 1 

in the eu a majority of member states have transposed the eu tobacco products directive including the provisions on novel tobacco products such as iqos  consumables and ecigarettes most of the eu member states require a notification submitted six months before the intended placing on the market of a novel tobacco product while some require premarket authorizations for the introduction of such products to date pursuant to these requirements we have filed a comprehensive dossier summarizing our scientific assessment of platform 1 in 14 member states 

there can be no assurance that we will succeed in our efforts to replace cigarettes with rrps or that regulation will allow us to commercialize rrps in all markets or treat rrps differently from combustible tobacco products such as cigarettes 

our rrp business development initiatives   in december 2013 we established a strategic framework with altria group inc “altria” under which altria will make available its evapor products exclusively to us for commercialization outside the united states and we will make available two of our rrps exclusively to altria for commercialization in the united states in march 2015 we launched solaris  a platform 4 evapor product licensed from altria in spain in december 2015 we introduced solaris  in israel 

in july 2015 we extended the strategic framework with altria to include a joint research development and technology sharing agreement the additional agreement provides the framework under which pmi and altria will collaborate to develop the next generation of evapor products for commercialization in the united states by altria and in markets outside the united states by pmi the collaboration between pmi and altria in this endeavor is enabled by exclusive technology cross licenses and technical information sharing the agreements also provide for cooperation on the scientific assessment of and for the sharing of improvements to the existing generation of licensed products 

in june 2014 we acquired 100 of nicocigs limited a leading ukbased evapor company whose principal brand is nicolites  this acquisition provided pmi with immediate access to and a significant presence in the uk evapor market 

governmental investigations 

from time to time we are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters we describe certain matters pending in thailand and south korea in item 3 legal proceedingsother litigation  

in november 2010 a wto panel issued its decision in a dispute relating to facts that arose from august 2006 between the philippines and thailand concerning a series of thai customs and tax measures affecting cigarettes imported by pm thailand into thailand from the philippines see item 3 legal proceedingsother litigation for additional information the wto panel decision which was upheld by the wto appellate body concluded that thailand had no basis to find that pm thailands declared customs values and taxes paid were too low as alleged by the dsi in 2009 the decision also created obligations for thailand to revise its laws regulations or practices affecting the customs valuation and tax treatment of future cigarette imports thailand agreed in september 2011 to fully comply with the decision by october 2012 the philippines contends that to date thailand has not fully complied and commenced formal proceedings 

 43 

at the wto to address the outstanding issues the philippines has repeatedly expressed concerns with ongoing investigations by thailand of pm thailand including those that led to the criminal charges described in item 3 legal proceedingsother litigation  noting that these investigations appear to be based on grounds not supported by wto customs valuation rules and inconsistent with several decisions already taken by thai customs and other thai governmental agencies

trade policy 

we are subject to various trade restrictions imposed by the united states of america and countries in which we do business “trade sanctions” including the trade and economic sanctions administered by the us department of the treasurys office of foreign assets control and the us department of state it is our policy to comply fully with these trade sanctions 

tobacco products are agricultural products under us law and are not technological or strategic in nature from time to time we make sales in countries subject to trade sanctions either where such sanctions do not apply to our business or pursuant to exemptions or licenses 

to our knowledge none of our commercial arrangements results in the governments of any country identified by the us government as a state sponsor of terrorism nor entities controlled by those governments receiving cash or acting as intermediaries in violation of us laws 

we do not sell products in iran sudan north korea cuba and syria we may from time to time explore opportunities to sell our products in one or more of these countries as permitted by law 

certain states within the us have enacted legislation permitting state pension funds to divest or abstain from future investment in stocks of companies that do business with certain countries that are sanctioned by the us we do not believe such legislation has had a material effect on the price of our shares

financial review 

Ÿ net cash provided by operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities of 81 billion  for the year ended december 31 2016  increased  by 212 million  from the comparable 2015  period excluding unfavorable currency movements of 409 million the change was due primarily to net earnings growth and lower cash payments related to exit costs partly offset by higher working capital requirements and 2016 installment payments of security into a court trust pertaining to the létourneau and blais  cases as well as a 2016 payment to the south korean tax authorities see item 8 note 19 contingencies  for additional information 

excluding currency the unfavorable variance in working capital was due primarily to the following 

 

net cash provided by operating activities of 79 billion  for the year ended december 31 2015  increased by 126 million  from the comparable 2014  period the change was due primarily to net earnings growth excluding unfavorable currency of 19 billion and working capital initiatives 

excluding currency the favorable variance in working capital was due primarily to the following 

 

 71 

Ÿ net cash used in investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities of 968 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  increased  by 260 million  from the comparable 2015  period due primarily to higher capital expenditures 

net cash used in investing activities of 708 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  decreased  by 288 million  from the comparable 2014  period due primarily to lower capital expenditures and purchases of businesses in 2014 

in june 2014 we acquired 100 of nicocigs limited a leading ukbased evapor company for the final purchase price of 103 million net of cash acquired for further details see item 8 note 6 acquisitions and other business arrangements  to our consolidated financial statements 

our capital expenditures were 12 billion  in 2016  10 billion  in 2015  and 12 billion  in 2014  the 2016  expenditures were primarily related to investments in rrps productivityenhancing programs and equipment for new products we expect total capital expenditures in 2017  of approximately 15 billion including additional capital expenditures related to our ongoing investment in rrps to support capacity expansion notably for iqos  consumables to be funded by operating cash flows 

Ÿ net cash used in financing activities 

during 2016  net cash used in financing activities was 54 billion  compared with net cash used in financing activities of 47 billion  during 2015  and 68 billion  in 2014  

the 2016  change was due primarily to lower net proceeds received from the sale of subsidiary shares to noncontrolling interests partially offset by higher proceeds from longterm debt issuances 

the 2015  change was due primarily to the cash used in 2014  to repurchase our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program as well as the 2015  net proceeds received from the sale of subsidiary shares to noncontrolling interests partially offset by lower net cash proceeds in 2015  from longterm debt 

on january 30 2014 the indonesian stock exchange “idx” adopted a regulation requiring all listed public companies to have at least a 75 public shareholding by january 30 2016 in order to comply with this requirement our subsidiary pt hm sampoerna tbk “sampoerna” of which we held a 9818 interest conducted a rights issue in connection with the rights issue pt philip morris indonesia “pmid” a fully consolidated subsidiary of pmi sold 264209711 of the rights to thirdparty investors delivery of the rights sold took place on october 26 2015 the total net proceeds from the rights issue were 15 billion at prevailing exchange rates on the closing date for further details see item 8 note 6 acquisitions and other business arrangements  to our consolidated financial statements 

during 2014  we used a total of 132 billion to repurchase our common stock pay dividends and repay debt these uses were partially offset by proceeds from our debt offerings and shortterm borrowings in 2014  of 66 billion 

dividends paid in 2016  2015  and 2014  were 64 billion  63 billion  and 60 billion  respectively 

Ÿ debt and liquidity 

we define cash and cash equivalents as shortterm highly liquid investments readily convertible to known amounts of cash that mature within a maximum of three months and have an insignificant risk of change in value due to interest rate or credit risk changes as a policy we do not hold any investments in structured or equitylinked products our cash and cash equivalents are predominantly held in demand deposits with institutions that have investmentgrade longterm credit rating 

 72 

credit ratings  – the cost and terms of our financing arrangements as well as our access to commercial paper markets may be affected by applicable credit ratings on march 21 2016 standard  poors affirmed our longterm credit rating at a and shortterm at a1 but revised our outlook to negative from stable on august 1 2016 fitch affirmed our longterm credit rating at a and shortterm at f1 as well as our negative outlook we do not expect the standard  poors and fitch negative outlooks to impact our borrowing costs on august 10 2016 moodys affirmed our longterm credit rating at a2 and shortterm at p1 as well as our stable outlook at february 13 2017 our credit ratings and outlook by major credit rating agencies were as follows 



credit facilities  –   on january 27 2016 we entered into an agreement to extend the term of our existing 25 billion multiyear revolving credit facility from february 28 2020 to february 28 2021 on january 27 2017 we entered into an agreement to extend the term of our 20 billion 364day revolving credit facility from february 7 2017 to february 6 2018 

  

at february 13 2017 our committed credit facilities were as follows 



1  on august 30 2016 we entered into an agreement effective october 1 2016 to extend the term of our multiyear revolving credit facility for an additional year covering the period october 1 2020 to october 1 2021 in the amount of 335 billion 

  

at february 13 2017 there were no borrowings under the committed credit facilities and the entire committed amounts were available for borrowing 

all banks participating in our committed credit facilities have an investmentgrade longterm credit rating from the credit rating agencies we continuously monitor the credit quality of our banking group and at this time we are not aware of any potential nonperforming credit provider 

each of these facilities requires us to maintain a ratio of consolidated earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “consolidated ebitda” to consolidated interest expense of not less than 35 to 10 on a rolling fourquarter basis at december 31 2016  our ratio calculated in accordance with the agreements was 106  to 10 these facilities do not include any credit rating triggers material adverse change clauses or any provisions that could require us to post collateral we expect to continue to meet our covenants the terms “consolidated ebitda” and “consolidated interest expense” both of which include certain adjustments are defined in the facility agreements previously filed with the us securities and exchange commission 

in addition to the committed credit facilities discussed above certain of our subsidiaries maintain shortterm credit arrangements to meet their respective working capital needs these credit arrangements which amounted to approximately 29 billion  at december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  are for the sole use of our subsidiaries borrowings under these arrangements amounted to 643 million  at december 31 2016  and 825 million  at december 31 2015  

commercial paper program –  we have commercial paper programs in place in the us and in europe our commercial paper programs in place in the us and in europe currently have an aggregate issuance capacity of 80 billion at december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  we had no commercial paper outstanding 

 73 

we expect that the existence of the commercial paper program and the committed credit facilities coupled with our operating cash flows will enable us to meet our liquidity requirements 

sale of accounts receivable  –  to mitigate credit risk and enhance cash and liquidity management we sell trade receivables to unaffiliated financial institutions these arrangements allow us to sell on an ongoing basis certain trade receivables without recourse the trade receivables sold are generally shortterm in nature and are removed from the consolidated balance sheets we sell trade receivables under two types of arrangements servicing and nonservicing 

pmi’s operating cash flows were positively impacted by the amount of the trade receivables sold and derecognized from the consolidated balance sheets which remained outstanding with the unaffiliated financial institutions the trade receivables sold that remained outstanding under these arrangements as of december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  were 729 million  888 million  and 120 million  respectively the net proceeds received are included in cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 

for further details see item 8 note 21 sale of accounts receivable  to our consolidated financial statements 

debt  –  our total debt was 291 billion  at december 31 2016  and 285 billion  at december 31 2015  our total debt is primarily fixed rate in nature for further details see item 8 note 7 indebtedness  the weightedaverage allin financing cost of our total debt was 28 in 2016  compared to 30 in 2015  see item 8 note 16 fair value measurements  to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our disclosures related to the fair value of debt the amount of debt that we can issue is subject to approval by our board of directors 

on february 21 2014 we filed a shelf registration statement with the us securities and exchange commission under which we may from time to time sell debt securities andor warrants to purchase debt securities over a threeyear period during february 2017 we plan to file a new shelf registration statement with the us securities and exchange commission 

our debt issuances in 2016  were as follows 



a  interest on these notes is payable semiannually in arrears beginning in august 2016 

b  interest on these notes is payable semiannually in arrears beginning in november 2016 

c  interest on these notes is payable annually in arrears beginning in may 2017 

d  these notes are a further issuance of the 425 notes issued by pmi in november 2014 

the net proceeds from the sale of the securities listed in the table above were used for general corporate purposes 

the weightedaverage time to maturity of our longterm debt was 106 years at the end of 2016  and 105 years at the end of 2015  

 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements including special purpose entities other than guarantees and contractual obligations discussed below 

guarantees  –  at december 31 2016  we were contingently liable for 08 billion of guarantees of our own performance which were primarily related to excise taxes on the shipment of our products there is no liability in the consolidated financial statements associated with these guarantees at december 31 2016  our thirdparty guarantees were insignificant 

 74 

aggregate contractual obligations  –  the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2016  



1  amounts represent the expected cash payments of our longterm debt and capital lease obligations 

2  amounts represent the expected cash payments of our interest expense on our longterm debt including the current portion of longterm debt interest on our fixedrate debt is presented using the stated interest rate amounts exclude the amortization of debt discounts the amortization of loan fees and fees for lines of credit that would be included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of earnings 

3  amounts represent the minimum rental commitments under noncancelable operating leases 

4  purchase obligations for inventory and production costs such as raw materials indirect materials and supplies packaging comanufacturing arrangements storage and distribution are commitments for projected needs to be utilized in the normal course of business other purchase obligations include commitments for marketing advertising capital expenditures information technology and professional services arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction amounts represent the minimum commitments under noncancelable contracts any amounts reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as accounts payable and accrued liabilities are excluded from the table above 

5  other longterm liabilities consist primarily of postretirement health care costs and accruals established for employment costs the following longterm liabilities included on the consolidated balance sheet are excluded from the table above accrued pension and postemployment costs tax contingencies insurance accruals and other accruals we are unable to estimate the timing of payments or contributions in the case of accrued pension costs for these items currently we anticipate making pension contributions of approximately 70 million in 2017 based on current tax and benefit laws as discussed in item 8 note 13 benefit plans  to our consolidated financial statements 

Ÿ equity and dividends 

we discuss our stock awards as of december 31 2016 in item 8 note 9 stock plans to our consolidated financial statements 

on august 1 2012 we began repurchasing shares under a threeyear 180 billion  share repurchase program that was authorized by our board of directors in june 2012 from august 1 2012 through december 31 2014 we repurchased 1446 million  shares of our common stock at a cost of 127 billion  under this repurchase program our authorized threeyear share repurchase program of 180 billion  expired in august 2015  during 2016  and 2015  we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock and we do not presently intend to repurchase shares of our common stock in 2017 

dividends paid in 2016  were 64 billion  during the third quarter of 2016  our board of directors approved a 20 increase in the quarterly dividend to 104 per common share as a result the present annualized dividend rate is 416 per common share 

market risk 

Ÿ counterparty risk    we predominantly work with financial institutions with strong short and longterm credit ratings as assigned by standard  poor’s and moody’s these banks are also part of a defined group of relationship banks noninvestment grade institutions are only used in certain emerging markets to the extent required by local business needs we have a conservative approach when it comes to choosing financial counterparties and financial instruments as such we do not invest or hold investments in any structured or equitylinked products the majority of our cash and cash equivalents is currently invested in demand deposits maturing within less than 30 days 

we continuously monitor and assess the credit worthiness of all our counterparties 

 75 

Ÿ derivative financial instruments   we operate in markets outside of the us with manufacturing and sales facilities in various locations throughout the world consequently we use certain financial instruments to manage our foreign currency and interest rate exposure we use derivative financial instruments principally to reduce our exposure to market risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates by creating offsetting exposures we are not a party to leveraged derivatives and by policy do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 

see item 8 note 15 financial instruments  item 8 note 16 fair value measurements  and item 8 note 20 balance sheet offsetting  to our consolidated financial statements for further details on our derivative financial instruments and the related collateral arrangements 

Ÿ value at risk    we use a value at risk computation to estimate the potential oneday loss in the fair value of our interestratesensitive financial instruments and to estimate the potential oneday loss in pretax earnings of our foreign currency pricesensitive derivative financial instruments this computation includes our debt shortterm investments and foreign currency forwards swaps and options anticipated transactions foreign currency trade payables and receivables and net investments in foreign subsidiaries which the foregoing instruments are intended to hedge were excluded from the computation 

the computation estimates were made assuming normal market conditions using a 95 confidence interval we use a “variancecovariance” model to determine the observed interrelationships between movements in interest rates and various currencies these interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate and forward currency rate movements over the preceding quarter for determining value at risk at december 31 2016  and 2015  and over each of the four preceding quarters for the calculation of average value at risk amounts during each year the values of foreign currency options do not change on a onetoone basis with the underlying currency and were valued accordingly in the computation 

the estimated potential oneday loss in fair value of our interestratesensitive instruments primarily debt under normal market conditions and the estimated potential oneday loss in pretax earnings from foreign currency instruments under normal market conditions as calculated in the value at risk model were as follows 



the value at risk computation is a risk analysis tool designed to statistically estimate the maximum probable daily loss from adverse movements in interest and foreign currency rates under normal market conditions the computation does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value or earnings to be incurred by us nor does it consider the effect of favorable changes in market rates we cannot predict 

 76 

actual future movements in such market rates and do not present these results to be indicative of future movements in market rates or to be representative of any actual impact that future changes in market rates may have on our future results of operations or financial position

we are a legal entity separate and distinct from our direct and indirect subsidiaries accordingly our right and thus the right of our creditors and stockholders to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of any subsidiary is subject to the prior rights of creditors of such subsidiary except to the extent that claims of our company itself as a creditor may be recognized as a holding company our principal sources of funds including funds to make payment on our debt securities are from the receipt of dividends and repayment of debt from our subsidiaries our principal wholly owned and majorityowned subsidiaries currently are not limited by longterm debt or other agreements in their ability to pay cash dividends or to make other distributions with respect to their common stock 

b financial information about segments 

  

we divide our markets into four geographic regions which constitute our segments for financial reporting purposes 

  

 

in the fourth quarter of 2015 to further align with the member state composition of the european union pmi transferred the management of its operations in bulgaria croatia romania and slovenia from its eema region to its european union region resulting in the reclassification of prior year amounts between the two segments the changes did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows in any of the periods presented 

net revenues and operating companies income   together with a reconciliation to operating income attributable to each segment for each of the last three years are set forth in note 12 segment reporting  to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  of this annual report on form 10k item 7 for a discussion of our operating results by business segment 

  

 2 

the relative percentages of operating companies income attributable to each reportable segment were as follows 

  



 

 

we use the term net revenues to refer to our operating revenues from the sale of our products net of sales and promotion incentives our net revenues and operating income are affected by various factors including the volume of products we sell the price of our products changes in currency exchange rates and the mix of products we sell mix is a term used to refer to the proportionate value of premiumprice brands to midprice or lowprice brands in any given market product mix mix can also refer to the proportion of shipment volume in more profitable markets versus shipment volume in less profitable markets geographic mix we often collect excise taxes from our customers and then remit them to local governments and in those circumstances we include excise taxes in our net revenues and excise taxes on products our cost of sales consists principally of tobacco leaf nontobacco raw materials labor and manufacturing costs 

  

our marketing administration and research costs include the costs of marketing and selling our products other costs generally not related to the manufacture of our products including general corporate expenses and costs incurred to develop new products the most significant components of our marketing administration and research costs are marketing and sales expenses and general and administrative expenses 

  

c narrative description of business 

  

our subsidiaries and affiliates and their licensees are engaged in the manufacture market and sale of cigarettes other tobacco products and other nicotinecontaining products in markets outside the united states of america 

  

our total cigarette shipments decreased  by 10  in 2015  to 8473 billion  units we estimate that international cigarette market shipments were approximately 54 trillion units in 2015  a 26 decrease over 2014  we estimate that our reported share of the international cigarette market which is defined as worldwide cigarette volume excluding the united states of america was approximately 156 in 2015  155 in 2014  and 157 in 2013  excluding the people’s republic of china “prc” we estimate that our reported share of the international cigarette market was approximately 287 285 and 283 in 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively 

  

shipments of our principal cigarette brand marlboro  increased  by 09  in 2015  and represented approximately 96 of the international cigarette market excluding the prc in 2015  94 in 2014  and 93 in 2013  

  

we have a cigarette market share of at least 15 and in a number of instances substantially more than 15 in 103 markets including algeria argentina australia austria belgium brazil canada colombia the czech republic egypt finland france germany greece hungary indonesia italy japan kazakhstan korea mexico the netherlands the philippines poland portugal romania russia saudi arabia serbia singapore spain sweden switzerland thailand turkey and ukraine

consumer focused marketing  sales 

  

in 2015 we continued to deploy our new strategic framework that combines our marketing and sales expertise with our indepth knowledge of various sales territories this framework allows us not only to engage more effectively with our adult smokers but also to enhance the success of our direct and indirect trade partners the main benefits are 

  

 

the four main types of distribution that we use globally often simultaneously in a given market are 

  

   

in many markets we also directly supply key accounts including gas stations retail chains and supermarkets 

  

our distribution and sales systems are supported by sales forces that total approximately 19900 employees worldwide our sales forces are well trained and recognized by trade surveys for their professionalism 

our products are marketed and promoted through various media and channels including where permitted by law point of sale communications brand events accessrestricted websites and printed and direct communication to verified adult smokers our direct communication with verified adult smokers utilizes mail email and other electronic communication tools promotional activities include where permitted by law competitions invitations to the events interactive programs consumer premiums and price promotions to support advertising and promotional activities in the markets we have a dedicated consumer engagement group that develops innovative engagement tools for adult smokers based on the latest technologies and adult smoker trends 

competition 

  

we are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business we compete primarily on the basis of product quality brand recognition brand loyalty taste innovation packaging service marketing advertising and retail price our competitors include three large international tobacco companies and several regional and local tobacco companies and in some instances stateowned tobacco enterprises principally in algeria egypt the prc taiwan thailand and vietnam industry consolidation and privatizations of stateowned enterprises have led to an overall increase in competitive pressures some competitors have different profit and volume objectives and some international competitors are susceptible to changes in different currency exchange rates we compete predominantly with american blend cigarette brands such as marlboro  lm   parliament  and chesterfield  which are the most popular across many of our markets we seek to compete in all profitable retail price categories although our brand portfolio is weighted towards the premiumprice category 

  

procurement and raw materials 

  

we purchase tobacco leaf of various types grades and styles throughout the world the majority through independent tobacco suppliers we also contract directly with farmers in several countries including argentina brazil colombia the dominican republic ecuador italy kazakhstan mexico pakistan the philippines and poland direct sourcing from farmers represents approximately 29 of pmi’s global leaf requirements the largest supplies of tobacco leaf are sourced from brazil the united states china malawi indonesia mostly for domestic use in kretek products argentina mozambique india tanzania philippines and turkey 

we believe that there is an adequate supply of tobacco leaf in the world markets to satisfy our current and anticipated production requirements 

 4 

in addition to tobacco leaf we purchase a wide variety of direct materials from a total of approximately 420 suppliers our top ten suppliers of direct materials combined represent approximately 57 of our total direct materials purchases the three most significant direct materials that we purchase are printed paper board used in packaging acetate tow used in filter making and fine paper used in cigarette manufacturing in addition the adequate supply and procurement of cloves are of particular importance to our indonesian business

research and development 

  

reducedrisk products   one of our strategic priorities is to develop assess and commercialize a portfolio of innovative products with the potential to reduce individual risk and population harm in comparison to smoking cigarettes we refer to these as reducedrisk products or rrps the use of this term applies to tobaccocontaining products and other nicotinecontaining products that have the potential to reduce individual risk and population harm in comparison to smoking cigarettes our rrps are in various stages of development and we already launched iqos  in japan switzerland and in various pilot cities including milan moscow lisbon and bucharest and solaris  an evapor product licensed from altria in spain and israel we are conducting extensive and rigorous scientific studies to determine whether we can support claims for such products of reduced exposure to harmful and potentially harmful constituents in smoke and ultimately claims of reduced disease risk when compared to smoking cigarettes before making any such claims we will need to rigorously evaluate the full set of data from the relevant scientific studies to determine whether they substantiate reduced risk any such claims may also be subject to government review and approval as is the case in the us today 

we draw upon a team of worldclass scientists from a broad spectrum of scientific disciplines whose efforts are guided by the following three key objectives 

 

 

 

in addition to iqos  we are developing three rrp platforms that are in various stages of commercialization readiness we are commercializing an evapor product under the nicolites and  vivid  brand names in the uk are also developing other potential platforms and are working on developing the next generation of evapor technology 

 5 

further information about our rrps is set forth in item 7 business environment  taxes legislation regulation and other matters regarding the manufacture marketing sale and use of tobacco products  reducedrisk products 

cigarette products   we conduct research to support and reinforce our cigarette product business we seek to be at the forefront of innovation for product enhancements and launches of innovative new products we have also increased support for the cigarette business because compliance with applicable laws and regulations is requiring additional capacity for analysis and testing 

other   finally working through biotechnology partners we conduct research and development activities on technology platforms that can potentially lead to the development of alternative uses of tobacco such as for the production of therapeutic molecules 

the research and development expense for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  is set forth in item 8 note 14 additional information  to the consolidated financial statements

risks related to our business and industry 

Ÿ consumption of taxpaid cigarettes continues to decline in many of our markets 

this decline is due to multiple factors including increased taxes and pricing governmental actions the diminishing social acceptance of smoking continuing economic and geopolitical uncertainty and the continuing prevalence of illicit products these factors and their potential consequences are discussed more fully below and in item 7 business environment  

Ÿ cigarettes are subject to substantial taxes significant increases in cigaretterelated taxes have been proposed or enacted and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted in numerous jurisdictions these tax increases may disproportionately affect our profitability and make us less competitive versus certain of our competitors 

tax regimes including excise taxes sales taxes and import duties can disproportionately affect the retail price of cigarettes versus other tobacco products or disproportionately affect the relative retail price of our cigarette brands versus cigarette brands manufactured by certain of our competitors because our portfolio is weighted toward the premiumprice cigarette category tax regimes based on sales price can place us at a competitive disadvantage in certain markets as a result our volume and profitability may be adversely affected in these markets 

increases in cigarette taxes are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on our sales of cigarettes due to resulting lower consumption levels a shift in sales from manufactured cigarettes to other tobacco products and from the premiumprice to the midprice or lowprice cigarette categories where we may be underrepresented from local sales to legal crossborder purchases of lower price products or to illicit products such as contraband counterfeit and illicit whites 

Ÿ our business faces significant governmental action aimed at increasing regulatory requirements with the goal of reducing or preventing the use of tobacco products 

governmental actions combined with the diminishing social acceptance of smoking and private actions to restrict smoking have resulted in reduced industry volume in many of our markets and we expect that such factors will continue to reduce consumption levels and will increase downtrading and the risk of counterfeiting contraband illicit whites and legal crossborder purchases significant regulatory developments will take place over the next few years in most of our markets driven principally by the world health organizations framework convention on tobacco control “fctc” the fctc is the first international public health treaty on tobacco and its objective is to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation the fctc has led to increased efforts by tobacco control advocates and public health organizations to reduce the palatability and attractiveness of tobacco products to adult smokers regulatory initiatives that have been proposed introduced or enacted include 

 our operating income could be significantly affected by regulatory initiatives resulting in a significant decrease in demand for our brands in particular requirements that lead to a commoditization of tobacco products as well as any significant increase in the cost of complying with new regulatory requirements 

 8 

Ÿ litigation related to tobacco use and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke could substantially reduce our profitability and could severely impair our liquidity 

there is litigation related to tobacco products pending in certain jurisdictions damages claimed in some tobaccorelated litigation are significant and in certain cases in brazil canada and nigeria range into the billions of us dollars we anticipate that new cases will continue to be filed the fctc encourages litigation against tobacco product manufacturers it is possible that our consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation see item 3 legal proceedings  item 3 and item 8 note 21 contingencies  for a discussion of pending litigation 

Ÿ we face intense competition and our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations 

we compete primarily on the basis of product quality brand recognition brand loyalty taste innovation packaging service marketing advertising and price we are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business the competitive environment and our competitive position can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions erosion of consumer confidence competitors introduction of lowerprice products or innovative products higher tobacco product taxes higher absolute prices and larger gaps between retail price categories and product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate tobacco products competitors include three large international tobacco companies and several regional and local tobacco companies and in some instances stateowned tobacco enterprises principally in algeria the prc egypt taiwan thailand and vietnam industry consolidation and privatizations of stateowned enterprises have led to an overall increase in competitive pressures some competitors have different profit and volume objectives and some international competitors are susceptible to changes in different currency exchange rates 

Ÿ because we have operations in numerous countries our results may be influenced by economic regulatory and political developments natural disasters or conflicts 

some of the countries in which we operate face the threat of civil unrest and can be subject to regime changes in others nationalization terrorism conflict and the threat of war may have a significant impact on the business environment economic political regulatory or other developments or natural disasters could disrupt our supply chain manufacturing capabilities or distribution capabilities in addition such developments could lead to loss of property or equipment that are critical to our business in certain markets and difficulty in staffing and managing our operations which could reduce our volumes revenues and net earnings 

there is an increasing number of conflicts including in the middle east and ukraine political uncertainty including potential effects from economic sanctions by the us or other governments could lead to significant disruptions to our business 

in certain markets we are dependent on governmental approvals of various actions such as price changes and failure to obtain such approvals could impair growth in our profitability 

in addition despite our high ethical standards and rigorous control and compliance procedures aimed at preventing and detecting unlawful conduct given the breadth and scope of our international operations we may not be able to detect all potential improper or unlawful conduct by our employees and international partners 

Ÿ we may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences or to respond to consumer behavior influenced by economic downturns 

our tobacco business is subject to changes in consumer preferences which may be influenced by local economic conditions to be successful we must 

 in periods of economic uncertainty consumers may tend to purchase lowerprice brands and the volume of our premiumprice and midprice brands and our profitability could suffer accordingly such downtrading trends may be reinforced by regulation that limits branding communication and product differentiation 

 9 

Ÿ we lose revenues as a result of counterfeiting contraband crossborder purchases and nontaxpaid volume produced by local manufacturers 

large quantities of counterfeit cigarettes are sold in the international market we believe that marlboro  is the most heavily counterfeited international cigarette brand although we cannot quantify the revenues we lose as a result of this activity in addition our revenues are reduced by contraband legal crossborder purchases and nontaxpaid volume produced by local manufacturers 

Ÿ from time to time we are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters 

investigations include allegations of contraband shipments of cigarettes allegations of unlawful pricing activities within certain markets allegations of underpayment of customs duties andor excise taxes allegations of false and misleading usage of descriptors and allegations of unlawful advertising we cannot predict the outcome of those investigations or whether additional investigations may be commenced and it is possible that our business could be materially affected by an unfavorable outcome of pending or future investigations see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsoperating results by business segmentbusiness environmentgovernmental investigations  for a description of certain governmental investigations to which we are subject 

Ÿ we may be unsuccessful in our attempts to introduce reducedrisk products and regulators may not permit reduced exposure or risk claims or the commercialization of these products 

we continue to seek ways to develop commercially viable new product technologies with the potential to reduce exposure to harmful constituents in smoke and individual risk and population harm all in comparison to smoking cigarettes our goal is to develop products whose potential to reduce exposure individual risk and population harm can be substantiated by rigorous scientific studies and that provide adult smokers the taste sensory experience nicotine delivery profile and ritual characteristics that are similar to those currently provided by cigarettes we may not succeed in these efforts if we do not succeed but others do we may be at a competitive disadvantage furthermore we cannot predict whether regulators will permit the marketing of tobacco products or other nicotinecontaining products with claims of reduced exposure or risk as compared with cigarettes a prohibition on any such claims could significantly undermine the commercial viability of these products 

Ÿ our reported results could be adversely affected by unfavorable currency exchange rates and currency devaluations could impair our competitiveness 

we conduct our business primarily in local currency and for purposes of financial reporting the local currency results are translated into us dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period during times of a strengthening us dollar our reported net revenues and operating income will be reduced because the local currency translates into fewer us dollars during periods of local economic crises foreign currencies may be devalued significantly against the us dollar reducing our margins actions to recover margins may result in lower volume and a weaker competitive position 

Ÿ the repatriation of our foreign earnings changes in the earnings mix and changes in us tax laws may increase our effective tax rate our ability to receive payments from foreign subsidiaries or to repatriate royalties and dividends could be restricted by local country currency exchange controls 

because we are a us holding company our most significant source of funds is distributions from our nonus subsidiaries under current us tax law in general we do not pay us taxes on our foreign earnings until they are repatriated to the us as distributions from our nonus subsidiaries these distributions may result in a residual us tax cost it may be advantageous to us in certain circumstances to significantly increase the amount of such distributions which could result in a material increase in our overall effective tax rate additionally the obama administration has indicated that it favors changes in us tax law that would fundamentally change how our earnings are taxed in the us if enacted and depending upon its precise terms such legislation could increase our overall effective tax rate certain countries in which we operate have adopted or could institute currency exchange controls that limit or prohibit our local subsidiaries ability to convert local currency into us dollars or to make payments outside the country this could subject us to the risk of local currency devaluation 

Ÿ our ability to grow profitability may be limited by our inability to introduce new products enter new markets or improve our margins through higher pricing and improvements in our brand and geographic mix 

our profit growth may suffer if we are unable to introduce new products or enter new markets successfully to raise prices or to improve the proportion of our sales of higher margin products and in higher margin geographies 

 10 

Ÿ we may be unable to expand our brand portfolio through successful acquisitions or the development of strategic business relationships 

one element of our growth strategy is to strengthen our brand portfolio and market positions through selective acquisitions and the development of strategic business relationships acquisition and strategic business development opportunities are limited and present risks of failing to achieve efficient and effective integration strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings there is no assurance that we will be able to acquire attractive businesses on favorable terms or that future acquisitions or strategic business developments will be accretive to earnings 

Ÿ government mandated prices production control programs shifts in crops driven by economic conditions and the impact of climate change may increase the cost or reduce the quality of the tobacco and other agricultural products used to manufacture our products 

as with other agricultural commodities the price of tobacco leaf and cloves can be influenced by imbalances in supply and demand and crop quality can be influenced by variations in weather patterns including those caused by climate change tobacco production in certain countries is subject to a variety of controls including government mandated prices and production control programs changes in the patterns of demand for agricultural products could cause farmers to plant less tobacco any significant change in tobacco leaf and clove prices quality and quantity could affect our profitability and our business 

Ÿ our ability to implement our strategy of attracting and retaining the best global talent may be impaired by the decreasing social acceptance of cigarette smoking 

the tobacco industry competes for talent with consumer products and other companies that enjoy greater societal acceptance as a result we may be unable to attract and retain the best global talent 

Ÿ the failure of our information systems to function as intended or their penetration by outside parties with the intent to corrupt them could result in business disruption litigation and regulatory action and loss of revenue assets or personal or other sensitive data 

we use information systems to help manage business processes collect and interpret business data and communicate internally and externally with employees suppliers customers and others some of these information systems are managed by thirdparty service providers we have backup systems and business continuity plans in place and we take care to protect our systems and data from unauthorized access nevertheless failure of our systems to function as intended or penetration of our systems by outside parties intent on extracting or corrupting information or otherwise disrupting business processes could result in loss of revenue assets or personal or other sensitive data litigation and regulatory action cause damage to our reputation and that of our brands and result in significant remediation and other costs to us 

Ÿ we may be required to replace thirdparty contract manufacturers or service providers with our own resources 

in certain instances we contract with third parties to manufacture some of our products or product parts or to provide other services we may be unable to renew these agreements on satisfactory terms for numerous reasons including government regulations accordingly our costs may increase significantly if we must replace such third parties with our own resources

at december 31 2015  we operated and owned 48  manufacturing facilities and maintained contract manufacturing relationships with 22 thirdparty manufacturers across 21 markets in addition we work with 38 thirdparty operators in indonesia who manufacture our handrolled cigarettes 

  

pmiowned manufacturing facilities 

  



  

in 2015  24 of our facilities each manufactured over 10 billion cigarettes of which ten facilities each produced over 30 billion units our largest factories are in st petersburg and krasnodar russia marikina and batangas philippines berlin germany izmir turkey krakow poland sukorejo and karawang indonesia merlo argentina klaipeda lithuania bucharest romania and kutna hora czech republic our smallest factories are mostly in latin america and asia where due to tariff and other constraints we have established small manufacturing units in individual markets we will continue to optimize our manufacturing base taking into consideration the evolution of trade blocks 

  

the plants and properties owned or leased and operated by our subsidiaries are maintained in good condition and are believed to be suitable and adequate for our present needs 

in 2012 we announced that we are working on all aspects that will lead to the commercialization of rrps in the 2016 to 2017 period on january 10 2014 we announced an investment of up to €500 million to develop our first manufacturing facility in the european union and an associated pilot plant near bologna italy to produce rrps on october 10 2014 the pilot plant officially opened for production once fully operational in 2016 the factory and pilot plant combined annual production capacity is expected to reach up to 30 billion units  heatsticks

tobaccorelated litigation 

  

legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened against us andor our subsidiaries andor our indemnitees in various jurisdictions our indemnitees include distributors licensees and others that have been named as parties in certain cases and that we have agreed to defend as well as to pay costs and some or all of judgments if any that may be entered against them pursuant to the terms of the distribution agreement between altria and pmi pmi will indemnify altria and philip morris usa inc pm usa a us tobacco subsidiary of altria for tobacco product claims based in substantial part on products manufactured by pmi or contract manufactured for pmi by pm usa and pm usa will indemnify pmi for tobacco product claims based in substantial part on products manufactured by pm usa excluding tobacco products contract manufactured for pmi 

it is possible that there could be adverse developments in pending cases against us and our subsidiaries an unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobaccorelated litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation 

damages claimed in some of the tobaccorelated litigation are significant and in certain cases in brazil canada and nigeria range into the billions of us dollars the variability in pleadings in multiple jurisdictions together with the actual experience of management in litigating claims demonstrate that the monetary relief that may be specified in a lawsuit bears little relevance to the ultimate outcome much of the tobaccorelated litigation is in its early stages and litigation is subject to uncertainty however as discussed below we have to date been largely successful in defending tobaccorelated litigation 

we and our subsidiaries record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated at the present time while it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur after assessing the information available to it i management has not concluded that it is probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending tobaccorelated cases ii management is unable to estimate the 

 12 

possible loss or range of loss for any of the pending tobaccorelated cases and iii accordingly no estimated loss has been accrued in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes in these cases if any legal defense costs are expensed as incurred 

it is possible that our consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation nevertheless although litigation is subject to uncertainty we and each of our subsidiaries named as a defendant believe and each has been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases that we have valid defenses to the litigation pending against us as well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts all such cases are and will continue to be vigorously defended however we and our subsidiaries may enter into settlement discussions in particular cases if we believe it is in our best interests to do so

we use the term net revenues to refer to our operating revenues from the sale of our products net of sales and promotion incentives our net revenues and operating income are affected by various factors including the volume of products we sell the price of our products changes in currency exchange rates and the mix of products we sell mix is a term used to refer to the proportionate value of premiumprice brands to midprice or lowprice brands in any given market product mix mix can also refer to the proportion of shipment volume in more profitable markets versus shipment volume in less profitable markets geographic mix we often collect excise taxes from our customers and then remit them to governments and in those circumstances we include the excise taxes in our net revenues and in excise taxes on products our cost of sales consists principally of tobacco leaf nontobacco raw materials labor and manufacturing costs 

our marketing administration and research costs include the costs of marketing and selling our products other costs generally not related to the manufacture of our products including general corporate expenses and costs incurred to develop new products the most significant components of our marketing administration and research costs are marketing and sales expenses and general and administrative expenses

executive summary 

the following executive summary provides significant highlights from the discussion and analysis that follows 

 

see the discussion of events affecting the comparability of statement of earnings amounts in the consolidated operating results section of the following discussion and analysis 

 

on april 4 2014 we announced the initiation by our affiliate philip morris holland bv pmh of consultations with employee representatives on a proposal to discontinue cigarette production at its factory located in bergen op zoom the netherlands pmh reached an agreement with the trade unions and their members on a social plan and ceased cigarette production on september 1 2014 during 2014 we recorded pretax asset impairment and exit costs of 489 million for further details see the asset impairment and exit costs section of the following discussion and analysis

for further details see the consolidated operating results  and operating results by business segment  sections of the following discussion and analysis  

• 2016 forecasted results –  on february 4 2016 we announced our forecast for 2016 fullyear reported diluted eps to be in a range of 425 to 435 at prevailing exchange rates at that time versus 442  in 2015 excluding an unfavorable currency impact at thenprevailing rates of approximately 060 per share for the fullyear 2016 the reported diluted earnings per share range represents an increase of approximately 10 to 12 versus adjusted diluted earnings per share of 442  in 2015 this forecast does not include any share repurchases in 2016 the company will revisit the potential for repurchases as the year unfolds depending on the currency environment we estimate 2016 international cigarette volume excluding the peoples republic of china and the us to decline by approximately 2025 in line with the estimated decline of 24 in 2015 

we calculated 2015 adjusted diluted eps as reported diluted eps of 442  plus the 003  per share charge related to asset impairment and exit costs less the 003  per share benefit related to discrete tax items 

adjusted diluted eps is not a measure under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap we define adjusted diluted eps as reported diluted eps adjusted for asset impairment and exit costs discrete tax items and unusual items we believe it is appropriate to disclose this measure as it represents core earnings improves comparability and helps investors analyze business performance and trends adjusted diluted eps should be considered neither in isolation nor as a substitute for reported diluted eps prepared in accordance with us gaap 

this 2016 guidance excludes the impact of future acquisitions unanticipated asset impairment and exit cost charges future changes in currency exchange rates and any unusual events the factors described in item 1a risk factors represent continuing risks to this forecast 

discussion and analysis 

critical accounting estimates 

item 8 note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in most instances we must use a particular accounting policy or method because it is the only one that is permitted under us gaap 

the preparation of financial statements requires that we use estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets liabilities net revenues and expenses as well as our disclosure of contingencies if actual amounts differ from previous estimates we include the revisions in our consolidated results of operations in the period during which we know the actual amounts historically aggregate differences if any between our estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 

 28 

the selection and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates have been discussed with our audit committee the following is a discussion of the more significant assumptions estimates accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

• revenue recognition   we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery of product has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured for our company this means that revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss is transferred to our customers title transfers to our customers upon shipment or upon receipt at the customers location as determined by the sales terms for each transaction the company estimates the cost of sales returns based on historical experience and these estimates are normally immaterial 

• goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets valuation  we test goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events occur that would warrant such review we perform our annual impairment analysis in the first quarter of each year while the company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment for both goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets to determine if it is more likely than not that an impairment exists the company elects to perform the quantitative assessment for our annual impairment analysis the impairment analysis involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit or nonamortizable intangible asset to the carrying value if the carrying value exceeds the fair value goodwill or a nonamortizable intangible asset is considered impaired to determine the fair value of goodwill we primarily use a discounted cash flow model supported by the market approach using earnings multiples of comparable global and local companies within the tobacco industry at december 31 2015  the carrying value of our goodwill was 74 billion which is related to ten reporting units each of which is comprised of a group of markets with similar economic characteristics the estimated fair value of our ten reporting units exceeded the carrying value as of december 31 2015  to determine the fair value of nonamortizable intangible assets we primarily use a discounted cash flow model applying the relieffromroyalty method we concluded that the fair value of our nonamortizable intangible assets exceeded the carrying value and any reasonable movement in the assumptions would not result in an impairment   these discounted cash flow models include management assumptions relevant for forecasting operating cash flows which are subject to changes in business conditions such as volumes and prices costs to produce discount rates and estimated capital needs management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the fair values are estimated and we believe these assumptions are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use since the march 28 2008 spinoff from altria we have not recorded a charge to earnings for an impairment of goodwill or nonamortizable intangible assets 

• marketing and advertising costs   we incur certain costs to support our products through programs which include advertising marketing consumer engagement and trade promotions the costs of our advertising and marketing programs are expensed in accordance with us gaap recognition of the cost related to our consumer engagement and trade promotion programs contain uncertainties due to the judgment required in estimating the potential performance and compliance for each program for volumebased incentives provided to customers management continually assesses and estimates by customer the likelihood of the customer achieving the specified targets and records the reduction of revenue as the sales are made for other trade promotions management relies on estimated utilization rates that have been developed from historical experience changes in the assumptions used in estimating the cost of any individual marketing program would not result in a material change in our financial position results of operations or operating cash flows we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to estimate our marketing programs during the past three years 

• employee benefit plans  as discussed in item 8 note 13 benefit plans  to our consolidated financial statements we provide a range of benefits to our employees and retired employees including pensions postretirement health care and postemployment benefits primarily severance we record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by us gaap these calculations include various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates assumed rates of return on plan assets compensation increases mortality turnover rates and health care cost trend rates we review actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so as permitted by us gaap any effect of the modifications is generally amortized over future periods we believe that the assumptions utilized in calculating our obligations under these plans are reasonable based upon our historical experience and advice from our actuaries 

weightedaverage discount rate assumptions for pensions and postretirement plans are as follows 



we anticipate that assumption changes coupled with decreased amortization of deferred losses will decrease 2016 pretax us and nonus pension and postretirement expense to approximately 209 million as compared with approximately 240 million in 2015 excluding 

 29 

amounts related to early retirement programs the anticipated decrease is primarily due to lower amortization of deferred losses in the netherlands due to a change in the amortization period 

weightedaverage expected rate of return and discount rate assumptions have a significant effect on the amount of expense reported for the employee benefit plans a fiftybasispoint decrease in our discount rate would increase our 2016 pension and postretirement expense by approximately 52 million and a fiftybasispoint increase in our discount rate would decrease our 2016 pension and postretirement expense by approximately 44 million similarly a fiftybasispoint decrease increase in the expected return on plan assets would increase decrease our 2016 pension expense by approximately 30 million see item 8 note 13 benefit plans  to our consolidated financial statements for a sensitivity discussion of the assumed health care cost trend rates 

• income taxes   income tax provisions for jurisdictions outside the united states as well as state and local income tax provisions are determined on a separate company basis and the related assets and liabilities are recorded in our consolidated balance sheets 

the extent of our operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions the final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal state and international tax audits in accordance with the authoritative guidance for income taxes we evaluate potential tax exposures and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment an additional charge to expense would result if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 

the effective tax rates used for interim reporting are based on our fullyear geographic earnings mix projections and cash repatriation plans changes in currency exchange rates earnings mix by taxing jurisdiction or in cash repatriation plans could have an impact on the effective tax rates which we monitor each quarter significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions 

prior to the spinoff of pmi by altria we were a wholly owned subsidiary of altria we participated in a taxsharing agreement with altria for us tax liabilities and our accounts were included with those of altria for purposes of its us federal income tax return under the terms of the agreement taxes were computed on a separate company basis to the extent that we generated foreign tax credits capital losses and other credits that could not be utilized on a separate company basis but were utilized in altria’s consolidated us federal income tax return we would recognize the resulting benefit in the calculation of our provision for income taxes we made payments to or were reimbursed by altria for the tax effects resulting from our inclusion in altria’s consolidated united states federal income tax return on the date of the spinoff of pmi by altria we entered into a tax sharing agreement with altria the tax sharing agreement generally governs altria’s and our respective rights responsibilities and obligations for predistribution periods and for potential taxes on the spinoff of pmi by altria with respect to any potential tax resulting from the spinoff of pmi by altria responsibility for the tax will be allocated to the party that acted or failed to act in a manner that resulted in the tax beginning march 31 2008 we were no longer a member of the altria consolidated tax return group and we filed our own us federal consolidated income tax return in the third quarter of 2015 the irs examination of altrias consolidated tax returns for the years 20072008 was concluded with no tax adjustments to pmi 

for further details see item 8 note 11 income taxes  to our consolidated financial statements 

• hedging  as discussed below in “market risk” we use derivative financial instruments principally to reduce exposures to market risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates by creating offsetting exposures for derivatives to which we have elected to apply hedge accounting gains and losses on these derivatives are initially deferred in accumulated other comprehensive losses on the consolidated balance sheet and recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings in the periods when the related hedged transactions are also recognized in operating results if we had elected not to use the hedge accounting provisions gains losses deferred in stockholders’ deficit equity would have been recorded in our net earnings for these derivatives 

• contingencies  as   discussed in item 8 note 21 contingencies  to our consolidated financial statements legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened against us andor our subsidiaries andor our indemnitees in various jurisdictions we and our subsidiaries record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated the variability in pleadings in multiple jurisdictions together with the actual experience of management in litigating claims demonstrate that the monetary relief that may be specified in a lawsuit bears little relevance to the ultimate outcome much of the tobaccorelated litigation is in its early stages and litigation is subject to uncertainty at the present time while it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur after assessing the 

 30 

information available to it i management has not concluded that it is probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending tobaccorelated cases ii management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss for any of the pending tobaccorelated cases and iii accordingly no estimated loss has been accrued in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes in these cases if any legal defense costs are expensed as incurred 

consolidated operating results 

our cigarette volume net revenues excise taxes on products and operating companies income by segment were as follows 





 31 

as discussed in item 8 note 12 segment reporting  to our consolidated financial statements we evaluate segment performance and allocate resources based on operating companies income which we define as operating income excluding general corporate expenses and amortization of intangibles plus equity incomeloss in unconsolidated subsidiaries net we believe it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze the business performance and trends of our various business segments 

references to total international cigarette market total cigarette market total market and market shares throughout this discussion and analysis  reflect our best estimates of taxpaid volumes based on a number of internal and external sources 

the following events that occurred during 2015  2014  and 2013  affected the comparability of our statement of earnings amounts 

•  asset impairment and exit costs –  for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  pretax asset impairment and exit costs by segment were as follows 



for further details see item 8 note 5  asset impairment and exit costs to our consolidated financial statements 

•  acquisitions and other business arrangements –   for further details see item 8 note 6  acquisitions and other business arrangements  to our consolidated financial statements 

2015  compared with 2014   

the following discussion compares our consolidated operating results for the year ended december 31 2015  with the year ended december 31 2014  

our cigarette shipment volume was down  by 10  excluding acquisitions reflected declines in 

 partially offset by growth in 

 

total cigarette volume in the european union was essentially flat with declines in greece italy and the united kingdom largely offset by growth in france germany and spain 

 32 

for the year ended december 31   2015  estimated inventory movements were favorable driven principally by a favorable comparison in japan as a result of the 2014 correction of distributor inventory movements partly related to the vat increase of april 2014 excluding these estimated inventory movements our total cigarette shipment volume decreased by 16  excluding acquisitions 

  

our cigarette market share increased in a number of key markets including argentina austria belgium egypt france germany indonesia korea the netherlands the philippines poland russia saudi arabia spain and switzerland 

our cigarette shipment volume by brand is shown in the table below 



the increase in cigarette shipment volume of  marlboro reflected growth in the european union notably france germany and spain partly offset by italy and the united kingdom eema notably saudi arabia and turkey partly offset by north africa and ukraine and asia notably the philippines and vietnam partly offset by japan and korea cigarette shipment volume of marlboro  decreased in latin america  canada mainly due to argentina brazil and mexico partly offset by colombia 

the increase in cigarette shipment volume of lm  was predominantly driven by growth in eema notably egypt turkey and ukraine partly offset by russia the decrease in cigarette shipment volume of parliament  was primarily due to kazakhstan korea russia and ukraine partly offset by japan and turkey cigarette shipment volume of bond street  was essentially flat with growth notably driven by australia russia and serbia largely offset by declines in the european union kazakhstan and ukraine the decrease in cigarette shipment volume of chesterfield  was due to eema mainly russia turkey and ukraine partly offset by the european union mainly the czech republic italy and poland and by latin america  canada mainly mexico the increase in cigarette shipment volume of philip morris  primarily reflects the morphing of diana  in italy the increase in cigarette shipment volume of lark  was principally driven by japan partly offset by korea 

our other tobacco products otp primarily include tobacco for rollyourown and makeyourown cigarettes pipe tobacco cigars and cigarillos total shipment volume of otp in cigarette equivalent units increased by 10  

total shipment volume for cigarettes and otp in cigarette equivalent units decreased by 10  excluding acquisitions 

our net revenues and excise taxes on products were as follows 



 33 

net revenues which include excise taxes billed to customers decreased  by 62 billion   77  excluding excise taxes net revenues decreased  by 30 billion   100  to 268 billion  this decrease  was due primarily to 

 currency movements decreased net revenues by 135 billion  and net revenues excluding excise taxes on products by 47 billion  the 47 billion  decrease was due primarily to the argentine peso australian dollar canadian dollar euro indonesian rupiah japanese yen mexican peso russian ruble turkish lira and the ukrainian hryvnia 

net revenues include 18 billion  in 2015  and 20 billion  in 2014  related to sales of otp these net revenue amounts include excise taxes billed to customers excluding excises taxes net revenues for otp were 673 million  in 2015  and 753 million  in 2014  

excise taxes on products decreased  by 32 billion   64  due primarily to 

 

governments have consistently increased excise taxes in most of the markets in which we operate as discussed in business environment  we expect excise taxes to continue to increase 

our cost of sales marketing administration and research costs and operating income were as follows 



cost of sales decreased  by 11 billion   103  due primarily to 

 

marketing administration and research costs decreased  by 345 million   49  due primarily to 

 

operating income decreased  by 11 billion   92  this decrease  was due primarily to 

  34 

 

on february 5 2015 we announced that our productivity and cost savings initiatives would include but were not limited to the continued enhancement of production processes the harmonization of tobacco blends the streamlining of product specifications and number of brand variants supply chain improvements and overall spending efficiency across the company we anticipated that these initiatives combined with savings associated with the manufacturing footprint restructuring implemented in 2014 notably in australia and the netherlands should result in a total company costbase increase excluding rrps and currency of approximately 1 in 2015 we decided to deploy additional investments some of which will not recur in 2016 to support the strong momentum of our cigarette brand portfolio and accelerate the geographic expansion of iqos  this resulted in a constant currency total costbase increase of 36 excluding rrps or 53 including rrps 

in 2016 we expect our total cost base including rrps to increase by approximately 1 excluding currency reflecting productivity and costsavings programs coupled with moderating prices for key inputs such as tobacco leaf clove and nontobacco materials 

our effective tax rate decreased  by 11  percentage points to 280  the 2015  effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by changes to repatriation assertions on certain foreign subsidiary historical earnings 58 million partially offset by a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits of 41 million following the conclusion of the irs examinations of altrias consolidated tax returns for the years 2007 and 2008 and pmis consolidated tax returns for the years 2009 through 2011 prior to march 28 2008 pmi was a wholly owned subsidiary of altria the 2014 effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by the asset impairment and exit costs related to the factory closures   the effective tax rate is based on our fullyear earnings mix by taxing jurisdiction and cash repatriation plans changes in our cash repatriation plans could have an impact on the effective tax rate which we monitor each quarter significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions based upon tax regulations in existence at december 31 2015  and our cash repatriation plans we estimate that our 2016 effective tax rate will be approximately 28 

we are regularly examined by tax authorities around the world and we are currently under examination in a number of jurisdictions it is reasonably possible that within the next twelve months certain tax examinations will close which could result in a change in unrecognized tax benefits along with related interest and penalties an estimate of any possible charge cannot be made at this time 

net earnings attributable to pmi of 69 billion   decreased  by 620 million   83  this decrease  was due primarily to lower operating income as discussed above partially offset by a lower effective tax rate diluted and basic eps of 442   decreased  by 71  excluding an unfavorable currency impact of 120  diluted eps increased by 181  

2014  compared with 2013 

the following discussion compares our consolidated operating results for the year ended december 31 2014 with the year ended december 31 2013 

our cigarette shipment volume of 8560 billion units decreased by 28 excluding acquisitions or 243 billion units the decline in our cigarette shipment volume was due primarily to 

 

 

 the overall declines were partially offset by 

 

our market share increased or was flat in a number of key markets including algeria argentina austria canada france germany italy korea the netherlands poland russia saudi arabia spain switzerland and the united kingdom 

 35 

our cigarette shipment volume by brand is shown in the table below 



the decrease in cigarette shipment volume of marlboro  reflected declines in the european union notably france italy and poland partly offset by the czech republic and spain eema notably in egypt russia and ukraine partly offset by algeria and saudi arabia asia due almost entirely to japan partly offset by the philippines and latin america  canada due predominantly to mexico the overall decline was partially offset by the positive impact of market share growth in the european union and eema regions market share of marlboro  in asia and latin america  canada was essentially flat 

the decrease in cigarette shipment volume of lm  was due primarily to eema notably saudi arabia and turkey partially offset by slightly increased or essentially flat shipments in the three other regions the increase in cigarette shipment volume of parliament  was driven by growth in all regions and notably in turkey the decrease in cigarette shipment volume of bond street  was due predominantly to kazakhstan serbia and ukraine partially offset by australia and russia the increase in cigarette shipment volume of chesterfield  was driven by growth in all regions and notably in italy poland and turkey partly offset by russia and ukraine the decrease in cigarette shipment volume of philip morris  was due almost entirely to japan principally reflecting the morphing to lark  partly offset by growth in the three other regions the decrease in cigarette shipment volume of lark  was due predominantly to turkey partly offset by japan including the impact of the morphing of philip morris  

total shipment volume of otp in cigarette equivalent units increased by 34 to 338 billion cigarette equivalent units mainly due to growth in the fine cut category notably in belgium the czech republic hungary and poland partially offset by france and germany 

total shipment volume for cigarettes and otp in cigarette equivalent units was down by 25 

our net revenues and excise taxes on products were as follows 



net revenues which include excise taxes billed to customers increased by 77 million 01 excluding excise taxes net revenues decreased by 1450 million 46 to 298 billion this decrease was due to 

 

 36 

currency movements decreased net revenues by 53 billion and net revenues excluding excise taxes on products by 21 billion due primarily to the argentine peso indonesian rupiah japanese yen russian ruble turkish lira and the ukrainian hryvnia partially offset by the euro 

net revenues include 20 billion in 2014 and 19 billion in 2013 related to sales of otp these net revenue amounts include excise taxes billed to customers excluding excises taxes net revenues for otp were 753 million in 2014 and 739 million in 2013 

excise taxes on products increased by 15 billion 31 due primarily to 

• higher excise taxes resulting from changes in retail prices and tax rates 55 billion partly offset by 

• favorable currency 33 billion and 

• volumemix 755 million 

our cost of sales marketing administration and research costs and operating income were as follows 



cost of sales increased by 26 million 02 due to 

 

marketing administration and research costs increased by 111 million 16 due to 

 

operating income decreased by 18 billion 134 this decrease was due primarily to 

 

interest expense net of 11 billion increased by 79 million due primarily to higher average debt levels partially offset by lower average interest rates on debt 

 37 

our effective tax rate decreased by 02 percentage points to 291 the 2014 effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by the asset impairment and exit costs related to the factory closures the 2013 effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by the additional expense associated with the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 17 million and the enactment of tax law changes in mexico 14 million 

equity incomeloss in unconsolidated subsidiaries net of 105 million increased by 127 million due primarily to higher earnings from our investments in north africa and russia which are reflected in the eema segment 

net earnings attributable to pmi of 75 billion decreased by 11 billion 126 this decrease was due primarily to an unfavorable currency impact on operating income and higher interest expense net diluted and basic eps of 476 decreased by 95 excluding an unfavorable currency impact of 080 diluted eps increased by 57 

operating results by business segment 

business environment 

taxes legislation regulation and other matters regarding the manufacture marketing sale and use of tobacco products 

the tobacco industry and our business face a number of challenges that may adversely affect our business volume results of operations cash flows and financial position these challenges which are discussed below and in item 1a risk factors  include 

 

Ÿ fctc   the world health organizations who framework convention on tobacco control fctc an international public health treaty with the objective of reducing tobacco use drives much of the regulation that shapes the business environment in which we operate the treaty to which 179 countries and the european union are parties requires parties to have in place various tobacco control measures and recommends others 

we support many of the regulatory policies required by the fctc including measures that strictly prohibit the sale of tobacco products to minors limit public smoking require health warnings on tobacco packaging and regulate product content to prevent increased adverse health effects of smoking we advocate measures that establish a regulatory framework for reducedrisk products we also support the use of tax and price policies to achieve public health objectives as long as such policies are not discriminatory or excessive and do not result in increased illicit trade 

however the fctc governing body the conference of the parties cop has adopted nonbinding guidelines and policy recommendations related to certain articles of the fctc some of which we strongly oppose including extreme measures such as pointofsale display bans plain packaging bans on all forms of communications with adult smokers ingredient restrictions or bans based on the concepts of palatability or attractiveness and excessive taxation among other things these measures would limit our ability to differentiate our products and disrupt competition are not based on sound evidence of a public health benefit are likely to lead to adverse consequences such as increased illicit trade and in some cases result in the expropriation of our trademarks and violate international treaties 

it is not possible to predict whether or to what extent measures recommended in the fctc guidelines will be implemented in some instances where these extreme measures have been adopted by national governments we have commenced legal proceedings challenging them 

Ÿ   excise sales and other taxes   excessive and disruptive tax increases and discriminatory tax structures are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on our profitability due to lower consumption and consumer downtrading from premium to nonpremium discount other lowprice or lowtaxed tobacco products such as fine cut tobacco and illicit products in addition in certain jurisdictions 

 38 

our products are subject to tax structures that discriminate against premiumprice products and manufactured cigarettes we believe that such tax structures undermine public health by encouraging consumers to turn to the illicit trade for cheaper tobacco products and ultimately undercut government revenue objectives disrupt the competitive environment and encourage criminal activity other jurisdictions have imposed or are seeking to impose levies or other taxes on tobacco companies we oppose such extreme and discriminatory tax measures 

Ÿ   eu tobacco products directive  in april 2014 the eu adopted the text of a significantly revised eu tobacco products directive that among other things provides for 

  

   

the revised directive entered into force in may 2014 member states are required to implement the directive by may 2016 

in june 2014 two of our subsidiaries filed papers in the english high court seeking judicial review of whether the directive complies with existing eu treaties in november 2014 the english high court referred the case to the court of justice of the european union “cjeu” and requested that the cjeu issue a judgment by may 2016 in july 2014 the government of poland filed a complaint with the cjeu challenging the validity of various provisions in the directive that ban menthol cigarettes the cjeu conducted hearings in both proceedings in september and october 2015 in december 2015 the advocate general of the cjeu issued opinions in both proceedings advising that the directive complies with eu law these opinions are not binding on the cjeu which is expected to issue its judgment by may 2016 it is not possible to predict the outcome of these legal proceedings 

Ÿ   plain packaging plain packaging regulation bans the use of branding logos and colors on packaging of tobacco products other than the brand name and variant which may be printed only in specified locations and in a uniform font similarly the brand name and variant may be printed on individual cigarettes only in specified locations and in a uniform font or not at all 

to date only australia has implemented plain packaging 

france ireland and the uk have adopted plain packaging legislation with implementation scheduled to begin no later than may 2016 and full compliance at retail required as of november 2016 in france and as of may 2017 in ireland and the uk in ireland implementation is subject to a ministerial commencement order which has yet to be issued 

in may 2015 three of our subsidiaries filed papers in the english high court seeking judicial review of the uk’s plain packaging legislation the english high court held a hearing in december 2015 and indicated that it would issue its judgment in february or march 2016 it is not possible to predict the outcome of these legal proceedings 

in other countries including hungary new zealand and norway proposals to implement plain packaging are in various stages of the legislative process additionally several countries including canada finland singapore and turkey are considering plain packaging but no legislative proposals have been published it is not possible to predict whether any of these countries will implement plain packaging 

australia’s plain packaging legislation triggered three legal challenges first major tobacco manufacturers including our australian subsidiary challenged the legislation’s constitutionality in the high court of australia although the high court found the legislation constitutional a majority of the justices concluded that plain packaging deprives tobacco manufacturers of their property raising serious questions about the legality of similar proposals in other jurisdictions second our hong kong subsidiary initiated arbitration proceedings against the australian government pursuant to the hong kongaustralia bilateral investment treaty and was seeking substantial compensation for the deprivation of its investments in australia in december 2015 the tribunal hearing the case declined jurisdiction 

 39 

to hear the merits of our subsidiarys claim the tribunals decision which is final does not address the legality or effectiveness of australias plain packaging legislation third several countries have initiated world trade organization wto dispute settlement proceedings against australia it is not possible to predict the outcome of these legal proceedings 

we oppose plain packaging because it expropriates our valuable intellectual property by taking away our trademarks and moves the industry much closer to a commodity business where there is no distinction among brands and therefore the ability to compete for adult smoker market share is greatly reduced several studies including industrycommissioned studies as well as data released by australian state governments show that there is no sound basis to conclude that the implementation of plain packaging in australia has had any impact on smoking prevalence among adults or youth data from australia also appear to confirm that since the implementation of plain packaging downtrading to lower price and lower margin brands has accelerated and illicit trade has increased 

in the event any particular jurisdiction adopts plain packaging regulation we will consider all available options including litigation to ensure the protection of our intellectual property 

Ÿ   restrictions and bans on the use of ingredients currently the who and others in the public health community recommend restrictions or total bans on the use of some or all ingredients in tobacco products including menthol some regulators have considered and rejected such proposals while others have proposed and in a few cases adopted restrictions or bans in particular as mentioned above the european union has banned characterizing flavors in tobacco products subject to an exemption until may 2020 for menthol other countries may follow the eus approach for instance turkey has banned menthol as of may 2020 more sweeping ingredient bans have been adopted by canada and brazil 

while the canadian ingredient ban exempts menthol on the national level some canadian provinces have adopted or are in the process of adopting menthol bans 

the brazil ingredients ban which as originally drafted would prohibit the use of virtually all ingredients with flavoring or aromatic properties is not in force due to a legal challenge by a tobacco industry union of which our brazilian subsidiary is a member it is not possible to predict the outcome of this legal proceeding 

broad restrictions and ingredient bans would require us to reformulate our american blend tobacco products and could reduce our ability to differentiate these products in the market in the long term menthol bans would eliminate the entire category of mentholated tobacco products we oppose broad bans or sweeping restrictions on the use of ingredients as they are often based on the subjective and scientifically unsupported notion that ingredients make tobacco products more “attractive” or “palatable” and therefore could encourage tobacco consumption and also because prohibiting entire categories of cigarettes such as menthol is likely to lead to a massive increase in illicit trade 

many countries have enacted or proposed legislation or regulations that require cigarette manufacturers to disclose to governments and to the public the ingredients used in the manufacture of tobacco products and in certain cases to provide toxicological information about those ingredients we have made and will continue to make full disclosures where adequate assurances of trade secret protection are provided 

Ÿ   bans on display of tobacco products at retail  in a few of our markets governments have banned or propose to ban the display of tobacco products at the point of retail sale other countries have rejected display ban proposals we oppose display bans because they restrict competition by favoring established brands and encourage illicit trade while not reducing smoking or otherwise benefiting public health in some markets our subsidiaries and in some cases individual retailers have commenced legal proceedings to overturn display bans 

Ÿ   health warning requirements in most countries governments require large and often graphic health warnings covering at least 30 of the front and back of cigarette packs the size mandated by the fctc a growing number of countries require warnings covering 50 of the front and back of the pack and a small number of countries require larger warnings such as australia 75 front and 90 back mexico 30 front and 100 back uruguay 80 front and back and canada 75 front and back 

in march 2013 the ministry of public health in thailand issued a regulation mandating health warnings covering 85 of the front and back of cigarette packs while a lower court suspended this requirement pending the outcome of legal challenges by two of our affiliates thailand’s supreme administrative court subsequently overturned this order and allowed the regulation to be implemented during the pendency of our affiliates’ claims the legal challenges by our affiliates are still pending it is not possible to predict the outcome of these proceedings 

 40 

we support health warning requirements designed to inform consumers of the risks of smoking where health warnings are not required we place them on packaging voluntarily in the official language or languages of the country we defer to governments on the content of warnings except for content that vilifies tobacco companies or does not fairly represent the actual effects of smoking however we oppose excessively large health warnings ie larger than 50 the data show that disproportionately increasing the size of health warnings does not effectively reduce tobacco consumption yet such health warnings impede our ability to compete in the market by leaving insufficient space for our distinctive trademarks and pack designs 

Ÿ   other packaging restrictions  some governments have passed or are seeking to pass restrictions on packaging and labeling including standardizing the shape format and layout of packaging as well as imposing broad restrictions on how the space left for branding and product descriptions can be used examples include prohibitions on 1 the use of colors that are alleged to suggest that one brand is less harmful than others 2 specific descriptive phrases deemed to be misleading including for example “premium” “full flavor” “international” “gold” “silver” and “menthol” and 3 in one country all but one variant per brand we oppose broad packaging restrictions because they unnecessarily limit brand and product differentiation are anticompetitive prevent us from providing consumers with information about our products unduly restrict our intellectual property rights and violate international trade agreements in some instances we have commenced litigation challenging such regulations it is not possible to predict the outcome of these proceedings 

Ÿ   bans and restrictions on advertising marketing promotions and sponsorships for many years the fctc has called for and countries have imposed partial or total bans on tobacco advertising marketing promotions and sponsorships including bans and restrictions on advertising on radio and television in print and on the internet the fctc also requires disclosure of expenditures on advertising promotion and sponsorship where such activities are not prohibited the fctc guidelines recommend that governments adopt extreme and sweeping prohibitions including all forms of communication to adult smokers where restrictions on advertising prevent us from communicating directly and effectively with adult smokers they impede our ability to compete in the market for this reason and because we believe that the available evidence does not show that marketing restrictions effectively reduce smoking we oppose complete bans on advertising and communication that do not allow manufacturers to communicate directly and effectively with adult smokers 

Ÿ   restrictions on product design antitobacco organizations and some regulators are calling for the further standardization of tobacco products by requiring for example that cigarettes have a certain minimum diameter which amounts to a ban on slim cigarettes or requiring the use of standardized filter and cigarette paper designs we oppose such restrictions because they limit our ability to differentiate our products and because we believe that there is no correlation let alone a causal link between product design variations and smoking rates nor is there any scientific evidence that these restrictions would improve public health 

reduced cigarette ignition propensity rcip standards recommended by the fctc guidelines have been adopted in several of our markets eg australia canada south africa south korea and the eu and are being considered in several others while the available evidence namely from two provinces in canada the state of new york and sweden so far suggests that the implementation of rcip standards did not result in the predicted reduction of smokingrelated fires rcip standards do increase production costs 

Ÿ   restrictions on public smoking the pace and scope of public smoking restrictions have increased significantly in most of our markets many countries around the world have adopted or are likely to adopt regulations that restrict or ban smoking in public andor work places restaurants bars and nightclubs some public health groups have called for and some countries regional governments and municipalities have adopted or proposed bans on smoking in outdoor places as well as bans on smoking in cars typically when minors are present and private homes the fctc requires parties to adopt restrictions on public smoking and the guidelines call for broad bans in all indoor public places but limit their recommendations on privateplace smoking such as in cars and homes to increased education on the risk of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke 

while we believe outright bans are appropriate in many public places such as schools playgrounds youth facilities and many indoor public places governments can and should seek a balance between the desire to protect nonsmokers from environmental tobacco smoke and allowing adults who choose to smoke to do so owners of restaurants bars cafes and other entertainment establishments should have the flexibility to permit restrict or prohibit smoking and workplaces should be permitted to provide designated smoking rooms for adult smokers finally we oppose bans on smoking outdoors beyond places and facilities for children and in private places 

• restrictions on the sale of innovative tobacco products  some governments have passed or are seeking to pass regulations that ban the sale of ecigarettes or “emerging” tobacco products including novel tobacco or nicotine products such as smokeless tobacco  where no combustion takes place and no smoke is produced  dissolvable tobacco products or nicotine and nicotine delivery systems ie evapor products these regulations might foreclose consumer access even to products that might be shown to present significantly less risk of harm than existing products we oppose such blanket bans of products that may have the potential to reduce the harm of smoking by contrast we support regulation that sets strict standards and propels innovation to benefit consumer and public health 

 41 

Ÿ   other regulatory issues   some regulators are considering or in some cases have adopted regulatory measures designed to reduce the supply of tobacco products these include regulations intended to reduce the number of retailers selling tobacco by for example reducing the overall number of tobacco retail licenses available or banning the sale of tobacco within arbitrary distances of certain public facilities we oppose such measures because they stimulate illicit trade and could arbitrarily deprive business owners and their employees of their livelihood with no indication that such restrictions would improve public health 

regulators in some countries have also called for the exclusion of tobacco from certain basic provisions of trade and investment agreements the transpacific partnership agreement “tpp” includes a provision that denies investors as defined in the tpp access to the investor state dispute settlement mechanism to challenge tobacco control measures none of the 12 parties to this agreement has yet ratified it if this carveout enters into force we believe it would constitute unfair discrimination against a legal industry be at odds with fundamental principles of international investment protection and constitute a dangerous precedent for many other sectors 

in a limited number of markets most notably argentina and japan we are dependent on governmental approvals that may limit our pricing flexibility 

Ÿ   illicit trade the   illicit tobacco trade creates a cheap and unregulated supply of tobacco products undermines efforts to reduce smoking especially among youth damages legitimate businesses stimulates organized crime increases corruption and reduces government tax revenue illicit trade may account for as much as 10 of global cigarette consumption this includes counterfeit contraband and the growing problem of illicit whites which are cigarettes legally produced in one jurisdiction for the sole purpose of being exported and illegally sold in another jurisdiction where they have no legitimate market we estimate that illicit trade in the european union accounted for more than 10 of total cigarette consumption in 2015 

a number of jurisdictions are considering regulatory measures and government action to prevent illicit trade in november 2012 the fctc adopted the protocol to eliminate illicit trade in tobacco products the “protocol” which includes supply chain control measures such as licensing of manufacturers and distributors enforcement in free trade zones controls on duty free and internet sales and the implementation of tracking and tracing technologies to date 54 countries have signed the protocol and 13 countries have ratified it the protocol will come into force once the fortieth country ratifies it after which countries must implement its measures via national legislation it is not possible to predict whether other countries will sign or ratify the protocol 

additionally we and our subsidiaries have entered into cooperation agreements with governments and authorities to support their antiillicit trade efforts for example in 2004 we entered into a 12year cooperation agreement with the eu and its member states that provides for cooperation with european law enforcement agencies on anticontraband and on anticounterfeit efforts under the terms of this agreement we make financial contributions of approximately 75 million per year recorded as an expense in cost of sales when product is shipped to support these efforts we are also required to pay the excise taxes vat and customs duties on qualifying seizures of up to 450 million genuine pmi products in the eu in a given year and five times the applicable taxes and duties if seizures exceed this threshold in a given year to date our payments for product seizures have been immaterial 

in 2009 our colombian subsidiaries entered into an investment and cooperation agreement with the national and regional governments of colombia to promote investment in and cooperation on anticontraband and anticounterfeit efforts the agreement provides 200 million in funding over a 20year period to address issues such as combating the illegal cigarette trade and increasing the quality and quantity of locally grown tobacco 

Ÿ   reducedrisk products   we use the term reducedrisk products “rrps” to refer to products with the potential to reduce individual risk and population harm in comparison to smoking cigarettes our rrps are in various stages of development and commercialization and we are conducting extensive and rigorous scientific studies to determine whether we can support claims for such products of reduced exposure to harmful and potentially harmful constituents in smoke and ultimately claims of reduced disease risk when compared to smoking cigarettes before making any such claims we will rigorously evaluate the full set of data from the relevant scientific studies to determine whether they substantiate reduced exposure or risk any such claims may also be subject to government review and approval as is the case in the united states today we draw upon a team of worldclass scientists and engineers from a broad spectrum of scientific disciplines and our efforts are guided by the following three key objectives 

 

 

 42 

 

our product development is based on the elimination of combustion via tobacco heating and other innovative systems for aerosol generation which we believe is the most promising path to reduce risk 

our approach to individual risk assessment is to use cessation as the benchmark because the shortterm and longterm effects of smoking cessation on risk reduction are well known 

four rrp platforms are in various stages of development and commercialization readiness 

 

 

 

 

we are also developing other potential product platforms 

we are proceeding with the commercialization of rrps in january 2014 we announced an investment of up to €500 million over three years in our first manufacturing facility in the european union and an associated pilot plant near bologna italy to produce our rrps the factory is designed to produce up to 30 billion units and is expected to become operational by the end of the first quarter of 2016 it will initially manufacture platform 1 tobacco sticks  heatsticks   

in the united states of america an established regulatory framework for assessing “modified risk tobacco products” exists under the jurisdiction of the food and drug administration “fda” we expect that future fda actions are likely to influence the regulatory approach of other interested governments our assessment approach and the studies conducted to date reflect the rigorous evidentiary package contemplated in the fda’s draft guidance for modified risk tobacco product applications 2012 we have shared our approach and studies with the fda’s center for tobacco products in parallel we are engaging with regulators in several eu member states as well as in a number of other countries we plan to submit a modified risk tobacco product application for platform 1 late in 2016 

as we work to develop evidence to substantiate the risk reduction potential of our products we will review our ability to make claims of reduced exposure or risk based on applicable laws and regulations and as we are already doing engage with regulators and share the evidence with them we are also engaging with the scientific community sharing our assessment approach and the results we have generated there can be no assurance that we will succeed in our efforts or that regulators will permit the marketing of our rrps with substantiated claims of reduced formation exposure individual risk or population harm 

in 2014 we introduced the iqos system in pilot city launches in nagoya japan and in milan italy we commenced national expansion in japan in september 2015 we launched iqos  in switzerland in august 2015 and   started pilot city launches in moscow lisbon and 

 43 

bucharest in november 2015 we also started our gradual expansion in italy beginning with rome and turin to date the product has not been marketed with claims of reduced risk 

in december 2013 we established a strategic framework with altria under which altria will make available its evapor products exclusively to us for commercialization outside the united states of america and we will make available two of our rrps exclusively to altria for commercialization in the united states of america in march 2015 we launched solaris  a platform 4 evapor product licensed from altria in spain in december 2015 we introduced solaris in israel  

in july 2015 we extended the strategic framework with altria to include a joint research development and technology sharing agreement the additional agreement provides the framework under which pmi and altria will collaborate to develop the next generation of evapor products for commercialization in the united states of america by altria and in markets outside the united states of america by pmi the collaboration between pmi and altria in this endeavor is enabled by exclusive technology cross licenses and technical information sharing the agreements also provide for cooperation on the scientific assessment of and for the sharing of improvements to the existing generation of licensed products 

in june 2014 we acquired 100 of nicocigs limited a leading ukbased evapor company whose principal brand is nicolites  this acquisition provided pmi with immediate access to and a significant presence in the uk evapor market 

Ÿ other legislation regulation or governmental action  in argentina the national commission for the defense of competition issued a resolution in may 2010 in which it found that our affiliates establishment in 1997 of a system of exclusive zonified distributors “ezds” in buenos aires city and region was anticompetitive despite having issued two prior decisions in 1997 and 2000 in which it had found the establishment of the ezd system was not anticompetitive in february 2016 the commission closed the investigation without finding any fault on the part of our affiliate this decision might be appealed 

in germany in october 2013 the administrative district office munich acting under the policy supervision of the bavarian ministry of health and environment sent our german affiliate an order alleging that certain components of its marlboro  advertising campaign do not comply with the applicable tobacco advertising law and requiring our affiliate to stop this particular campaign throughout germany our affiliate filed a challenge in the munich administrative court which was granted in part and denied in part at an appeals hearing in april 2014 before the bavarian higher administrative court the parties agreed that our affiliate could continue the campaign with certain limitations on image visuals and text slogans for the duration of the court proceedings in april 2015 the administrative district office munich issued a revised order which again required our affiliate to stop using core elements of this particular campaign within one to three months from the effective date of the order our affiliate again challenged the order in the munich administrative court and in october 2015 the first instance court nullified the order the administrative district office munich can appeal this decision 

it is not possible to predict what if any additional legislation regulation or other governmental action will be enacted or implemented relating to the manufacturing advertising sale or use of tobacco products or the tobacco industry generally it is possible however that legislation regulation or other governmental action could be enacted or implemented that might materially affect our business volume results of operations cash flows and financial position 

governmental investigations 

from time to time we are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters the department of special investigations “dsi” of the government of thailand has been conducting an investigation into alleged underpayment by philip morris thailand limited pm thailand of customs duties and excise taxes of approximately 18 billion relating to imports from indonesia covering the period 20002003 pm thailand has been cooperating with the thai authorities and believes that its declared import prices are in compliance with the customs valuation agreement of the wto and thai law 

additionally in november 2010 a wto panel issued its decision in a dispute relating to facts that arose from august 2006 between the philippines and thailand concerning a series of thai customs and tax measures affecting cigarettes imported by pm thailand into thailand from the philippines see item 3 legal proceedings other litigation  for additional information the wto panel decision which was upheld by the wto appellate body concluded that thailand had no basis to find that pm thailands declared customs values and taxes paid were too low as alleged by the dsi in 2009 the decision also created obligations for thailand to revise its laws regulations or practices affecting the customs valuation and tax treatment of future cigarette imports thailand agreed in september 2011 to fully comply with the decision by october 2012 the philippines contends that to date thailand has not fully complied and is pursuing bilateral discussions with thailand to address the outstanding issues the philippines has repeatedly expressed concerns with ongoing investigations by thailand of pm thailand including those that led to the criminal charges described in item 3 legal proceedings other litigation  noting that these investigations appear to be based on grounds not supported by wto customs valuation rules and inconsistent with several decisions already taken by thai customs and other thai governmental agencies

acquisitions and other business arrangements 

in july 2015 we dissolved our exclusive joint venture agreement with swedish match ab swma to commercialize swedish snus and other smokefree tobacco products worldwide outside of scandinavia and the united states the dissolution mutually agreed with swma means that both companies will now focus on independent strategies for the commercialization of these products and the trademarks and intellectual property licensed to the joint venture by the companies will revert to their original owners the dissolution of this agreement was not material to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows in any of the periods presented 

on january 30 2014 the indonesian stock exchange “idx” adopted a regulation requiring all listed public companies to have at least a 75 public shareholding by january 30 2016 in order to comply with this requirement our subsidiary pt hm sampoerna tbk “sampoerna” of which we held a 9818 interest conducted a rights issue the exercise price for the rights was set at rp 77000 per share a 1349 premium to the closing price on the idx as of september 30 2015 in connection with the rights issue pt philip morris indonesia “pmid” a fully consolidated subsidiary of pmi sold 264209711 of the rights to thirdparty investors delivery of the rights sold took place on october 26 2015 the total net proceeds from the rights issue were 15 billion at prevailing exchange rates on the closing date the sale of the rights resulted in an increase to our additional paidin capital of 11 billion 

in june 2014 we acquired 100 of nicocigs limited a leading ukbased evapor company for the final purchase price of 103 million net of cash acquired with additional contingent payments of up to 77 million primarily relating to performance targets over a threeyear period as of december 31 2015 pmi does not anticipate that the performance targets will be met for additional information see item 8 note 16 fair value measurements to our consolidated financial statements the effect of this acquisition was not material to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows in any of the periods presented 

in the fourth quarter of 2013 as part of our initiative to enhance profitability and growth in north african and middle eastern markets we decided to restructure our business in egypt the new business model entails a new contract manufacturing agreement with our longstanding strategic business partner eastern company sae the creation of a new pmi affiliate in egypt and a new distribution agreement with trans business for trading and distribution llc to accomplish this restructuring and to ensure a smooth transition to the new model we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2013 a charge to our 2013 fullyear reported diluted eps of approximately 010 to reflect the discontinuation of existing contractual arrangements 

in september 2013 grupo carso sab de cv grupo carso sold to us its remaining 20 interest in our mexican tobacco business for 703 million as a result we now own 100 of the mexican tobacco business a former director of pmi whose term expired at the annual meeting of shareholders in may 2015 had an affiliation with grupo carso the final purchase price was subject to an adjustment based on the actual performance of the mexican tobacco business over the threeyear period ending two fiscal years after the closing of the purchase in may 2015 we received a payment of 113 million from grupo carso as the final purchase price adjustment this resulted in a total net purchase price of 590 million in addition we agreed to pay a dividend of approximately 38 million to grupo carso related to the earnings of the mexican tobacco business for the nine months ended september 30 2013 in march 2014 the dividend was declared and paid the purchase of the remaining 20 interest resulted in a net decrease to our additional paidin capital of 559 million

asset impairment and exit costs 

in november 2015 we commenced the implementation of a restructuring program within our european union segment the program is expected to be completed by the end of 2017 in total we expect to incur a total pretax charge of approximately 93 million for the program during 2015 we recorded pretax exit costs of 68 million related to employee separation costs in addition as part of the total program up to 25 million of pretax implementation costs primarily related to costs for the project team and notice period payments will be reflected in cost of sales and marketing administration and research costs in our consolidated statement of earnings

trade policy 

we are subject to various trade restrictions imposed by the united states of america and countries in which we do business “trade sanctions” including the trade and economic sanctions administered by the us department of the treasurys office of foreign assets control and the us department of state it is our policy to comply fully with these trade sanctions 

tobacco products are agricultural products under us law and are not technological or strategic in nature from time to time we make sales in countries subject to trade sanctions either where they do not apply to our business or pursuant to either exemptions or licenses granted under the applicable trade sanctions 

a subsidiary sells products to distributors that in turn sell those products to duty free customers that supply un peacekeeping forces around the world including those in the republic of the sudan we do not believe that these exempt sales of our products for ultimate resale in the republic of the sudan which are de minimis in volume and value present a material risk to our shareholders our reputation or the value of our shares we have no employees operations or assets in the republic of the sudan 

to our knowledge none of our commercial arrangements results in the governments of any country identified by the us government as a state sponsor of terrorism nor entities controlled by those governments receiving cash or acting as intermediaries in violation of us laws 

we do not sell products in cuba iran north korea and syria 

certain states within the us have enacted legislation permitting state pension funds to divest or abstain from future investment in stocks of companies that do business with certain countries that are sanctioned by the us we do not believe such legislation has had a material effect on the price of our shares

2015  compared with 2014   

the following discussion compares operating results within each of our reportable segments for 2015  with 2014  

european union 



net revenues which include excise taxes billed to customers decreased  by 40 billion  excluding excise taxes net revenues decreased  by 11 billion  due primarily to 

 

the net revenues of the european union segment include 15 billion  in 2015  and 16 billion  in 2014  related to sales of otp excluding excise taxes otp net revenues for the european union segment were 509 million  in 2015  and 573 million  in 2014  

operating companies income decreased  by 239 million  during 2015  this decrease  was due primarily to 

 

european union  industry volume   

the estimated total cigarette market in the european union of 5079 billion  units decreased by 09  the net impact of estimated trade inventory movements was neutral the moderate decline of the estimated total cigarette market reflected in certain key geographies improving economies a decrease in the prevalence of illicit trade lower outswitching to the fine cut category and a lower prevalence of evapor products 

the estimated total otp market in the european union of 1649 billion  cigarette equivalent units decreased  by 03  the total fine cut market was flat  at 1439 billion  cigarette equivalent units

european union  shipment volume and market share 

cigarette shipment volume and market share performance by brand are shown in the tables below 





our cigarette shipment volume of 1946 billion  units decreased  by 01  or by 04 excluding favorable net trade inventory movements mainly in italy market share increased by 01  point to 383  with gains notably in france germany poland and spain largely offset by the czech republic greece italy and portugal 

our shipments of otp of 234 billion  cigarette equivalent units increased  by 22  our total otp market share increased  by 02  points to 142

european union  market discussions 

in france  estimated industry size our cigarette shipment volume and market share performance are shown in the table below 



the increase in the estimated total cigarette market reflected its general recovery since the second half of 2014 and a lower prevalence of evapor products and illicit trade the increase in our cigarette shipment volume mainly reflected market share growth notably of premium brands marlboro    benefiting from a round retail price point of €700 per pack and the launch of marlboro 25s in the first quarter of 2015   and philip morris  the estimated total industry fine cut category of 145 billion  cigarette equivalent units increased  by 69  our market share of the category decreased  by 12  points to 250  

in germany  estimated industry size our cigarette shipment volume and market share performance are shown in the table below 



the decline of the estimated total cigarette market was partly due to the impact of price increases partially offset by a lower prevalence of illicit trade the increase in our cigarette shipment volume principally reflected market share growth driven by marlboro  mainly reflecting the positive impact of the new architecture 20 and lm  benefiting from a rounded retail price point of €500 per pack of 19s the estimated total industry fine cut category of 410 billion  cigarette equivalent units decreased  by 05  our market share of the category decreased   by 02 points to 127

Ÿ net cash used in investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities of 708 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  decreased  by 288 million  from the comparable 2014  period due primarily to lower capital expenditures and purchases of businesses in 2014 

net cash used in investing activities of 996 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  decreased  by 17 billion  from the comparable 2013  period due primarily to less cash spent on investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries and higher cash collateral received from derivatives designated as net investment hedges partially offset primarily by the purchase of nicocigs limited

each of these facilities requires us to maintain a ratio of consolidated earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “consolidated ebitda” to consolidated interest expense of not less than 35 to 10 on a rolling fourquarter basis at december 31 2015  our ratio calculated in accordance with the agreements was 105  to 10 these facilities do not include any credit rating triggers material adverse change clauses or any provisions that could require us to post collateral we expect to continue to meet our covenants the terms “consolidated ebitda” and “consolidated interest expense” both of which include certain adjustments are defined in the facility agreements previously filed with the us securities and exchange commission 

 75 

in addition to the committed credit facilities discussed above certain of our subsidiaries maintain shortterm credit arrangements to meet their respective working capital needs these credit arrangements which amounted to approximately 29 billion  at december 31 2015  and 32 billion  at december 31 2014  are for the sole use of our subsidiaries borrowings under these arrangements amounted to 825 million  at december 31 2015  and 12 billion  at december 31 2014  

commercial paper program –  we have commercial paper programs in place in the us and in europe at december 31 2015  and december 31 2014  we had no commercial paper outstanding 

effective april 19 2013 our commercial paper program in the us was increased by 20 billion as a result our commercial paper programs in place in the us and in europe currently have an aggregate issuance capacity of 80 billion 

we expect that the existence of the commercial paper program and the committed credit facilities coupled with our operating cash flows will enable us to meet our liquidity requirements 

sale of accounts receivable  –  to mitigate credit risk and enhance cash and liquidity management we sell trade receivables to unaffiliated financial institutions these arrangements allow us to sell on an ongoing basis certain trade receivables without recourse the trade receivables sold are generally shortterm in nature and are removed from the consolidated balance sheets we sell trade receivables under two types of arrangements servicing and nonservicing 

pmi’s operating cash flows were positively impacted by the amount of the trade receivables sold and derecognized from the consolidated balance sheets which remained outstanding with the unaffiliated financial institutions the trade receivables sold that remained outstanding under these arrangements as of december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  were 888 million  120 million  and 146 million  respectively the net proceeds received are included in cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows

debt  –  our total debt was 285 billion  at december 31 2015  and 295 billion  at december 31 2014  our total debt is primarily fixed rate in nature for further details see item 8 note 7 indebtedness  the weightedaverage allin financing cost of our total debt was 30 in 2015  compared to 32 in 2014  see item 8 note 16 fair value measurements  to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our disclosures related to the fair value of debt the amount of debt that we can issue is subject to approval by our board of directors 

on february 21 2014 we filed a shelf registration statement with the us securities and exchange commission under which we may from time to time sell debt securities andor warrants to purchase debt securities over a threeyear period 

our debt issuances in 2015  were as follows 



a  interest on these notes is payable annually in arrears beginning in february 2016 

the net proceeds from the sale of the securities listed in the table above will be used for general corporate purposes 

the weightedaverage time to maturity of our longterm debt was 108 years at the end of 2014  and 105 years at the end of 2015  

 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements including special purpose entities other than guarantees and contractual obligations discussed below 

 76 

guarantees  –  at december 31 2015  we were contingently liable for 07 billion of guarantees of our own performance which were primarily related to excise taxes on the shipment of our products there is no liability in the consolidated financial statements associated with these guarantees at december 31 2015 our thirdparty guarantees were insignificant 

aggregate contractual obligations  –  the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2015

5  amounts represent the minimum rental commitments under noncancelable operating leases 

6  purchase obligations for inventory and production costs such as raw materials indirect materials and supplies packaging comanufacturing arrangements storage and distribution are commitments for projected needs to be utilized in the normal course of business other purchase obligations include commitments for marketing advertising capital expenditures information technology and professional services arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction amounts represent the minimum commitments under noncancelable contracts any amounts reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as accounts payable and accrued liabilities are excluded from the table above 

7  other longterm liabilities consist primarily of postretirement health care costs and accruals established for employment costs the following longterm liabilities included on the consolidated balance sheet are excluded from the table above accrued pension and postemployment costs tax contingencies insurance accruals and other accruals we are unable to estimate the timing of payments or contributions in the case of accrued pension costs for these items currently we anticipate making pension contributions of approximately 113 million in 2016 based on current tax and benefit laws as discussed in item 8 note 13 benefit plans  to our consolidated financial statements 

the ec agreement payments discussed below are excluded from the table above as the payments are subject to adjustment based on certain variables including our market share in the eu 

ec agreement  –  as discussed in item 8 note 20 ec agreement  in 2004 we entered into an agreement with the european commission acting on behalf of the european community that provides for broad cooperation with european law enforcement agencies on anticontraband and anticounterfeit efforts this agreement has been signed by all 27 member states this agreement calls for payments that are to be adjusted based on certain variables including our market share in the european union in the year preceding payment because future additional payments are subject to these variables we record these payments as an expense in cost of sales when product is shipped in addition we are also responsible to pay the excise taxes vat and customs duties on qualifying product seizures of up to 90 million cigarettes and are subject to payments of five times the applicable taxes and duties if qualifying product seizures exceed 90 million cigarettes in a given year in october 2014 this agreement was amended and the threshold was increased to 450 million cigarettes in a given year this modification was effective as of july 2012 to date our annual payments related to product seizures have been immaterial total charges related to the ec agreement of 79 million  71 million  and 81 million  were recorded in cost of sales in 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively 

 77 

Ÿ equity and dividends 

as discussed in item 8 note 9 stock plans  to our consolidated financial statements during 2015  we granted 15 million  shares of deferred stock awards to eligible employees at a weightedaverage grant date fair value of 8228  per share equity awards generally vest three or more years after the date of the award subject to earlier vesting on death or disability or normal retirement or separation from employment by mutual agreement after reaching age 58 

in may 2012 our stockholders approved the philip morris international inc 2012 performance incentive plan the “2012 plan” under the 2012 plan we may grant to eligible employees restricted stock restricted stock units and deferred stock units performancebased cash incentive awards and performancebased equity awards up to 30 million  shares of our common stock may be issued under the 2012 plan at december 31 2015  shares available for grant under the 2012 plan were 23249430  

on august 1 2012 we began repurchasing shares under a new threeyear 180 billion  share repurchase program that was authorized by our board of directors in june 2012 from august 1 2012 through december 31 2014 we repurchased 1446 million  shares of our common stock at a cost of 127 billion  under this repurchase program during 2015  we did not repurchase any shares under this program 

on february 4 2016 we announced that we do not plan any share repurchases in 2016 we will revisit the potential for repurchases as the year unfolds depending on the currency environment 

dividends paid in 2015  were 63 billion  during the third quarter of 2015 our board of directors approved a 20 increase in the quarterly dividend to 102 per common share as a result the present annualized dividend rate is 408 per common share 

market risk 

Ÿ counterparty risk    we predominantly work with financial institutions with strong short and longterm credit ratings as assigned by standard  poor’s and moody’s these banks are also part of a defined group of relationship banks noninvestment grade institutions are only used in certain emerging markets to the extent required by local business needs we have a conservative approach when it comes to choosing financial counterparties and financial instruments as such we do not invest or hold investments in any structured or equitylinked products the majority of our cash and cash equivalents is currently invested in bank deposits maturing within less than 30 days 

we continuously monitor and assess the credit worthiness of all our counterparties 

Ÿ derivative financial instruments   we operate in markets outside of the us with manufacturing and sales facilities in various locations throughout the world consequently we use certain financial instruments to manage our foreign currency and interest rate exposure we use derivative financial instruments principally to reduce our exposure to market risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates by creating offsetting exposures we are not a party to leveraged derivatives and by policy do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 

see item 8 note 15 financial instruments  item 8 note 16 fair value measurements  and item 8 note 22 balance sheet offsetting  to our consolidated financial statements for further details on our derivative financial instruments and the related collateral arrangements 

Ÿ value at risk    we use a value at risk computation to estimate the potential oneday loss in the fair value of our interestratesensitive financial instruments and to estimate the potential oneday loss in pretax earnings of our foreign currency pricesensitive derivative financial instruments this computation includes our debt shortterm investments and foreign currency forwards swaps and options anticipated transactions foreign currency trade payables and receivables and net investments in foreign subsidiaries which the foregoing instruments are intended to hedge were excluded from the computation 

the computation estimates were made assuming normal market conditions using a 95 confidence interval we use a “variancecovariance” model to determine the observed interrelationships between movements in interest rates and various currencies these interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate and forward currency rate movements over the preceding quarter for determining value at risk at december 31 2015  and 2014  and over each of the four preceding quarters for the calculation of average value at risk amounts during each year the values of foreign currency options do not change on a onetoone basis with the underlying currency and were valued accordingly in the computation 

 78 

the estimated potential oneday loss in fair value of our interestratesensitive instruments primarily debt under normal market conditions and the estimated potential oneday loss in pretax earnings from foreign currency instruments under normal market conditions as calculated in the value at risk model were as follows 



the value at risk computation is a risk analysis tool designed to statistically estimate the maximum probable daily loss from adverse movements in interest and foreign currency rates under normal market conditions the computation does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value or earnings to be incurred by us nor does it consider the effect of favorable changes in market rates we cannot predict actual future movements in such market rates and do not present these results to be indicative of future movements in market rates or to be representative of any actual impact that future changes in market rates may have on our future results of operations or financial position 

contingencies

the relative percentages of operating companies income attributable to each reportable segment were as follows 

  



 

 

we use the term net revenues to refer to our operating revenues from the sale of our products net of sales and promotion incentives our net revenues and operating income are affected by various factors including the volume of products we sell the price of our products changes in currency exchange rates and the mix of products we sell mix is a term used to refer to the proportionate value of premiumprice brands to midprice or lowprice brands in any given market product mix mix can also refer to the proportion of shipment volume in more profitable markets versus shipment volume in less profitable markets geographic mix we often collect excise taxes from our customers and then remit them to local governments and in those circumstances we include excise taxes in our net revenues and excise taxes on products our cost of sales consists principally of tobacco leaf nontobacco raw materials labor and manufacturing costs 

  

our marketing administration and research costs include the costs of marketing and selling our products other costs generally not related to the manufacture of our products including general corporate expenses and costs incurred to develop new products the most significant components of our marketing administration and research costs are marketing and sales expenses and general and administrative expenses

consumer focused marketing  sales 

  

in 2014 we continued to deploy our new strategic framework that combines our marketing and sales expertise with our indepth knowledge of various sales territories this framework allows us not only to engage more effectively with our adult smokers but also to enhance the success of our direct and indirect trade partners the main benefits are 

  

 

the four main types of distribution that we use globally often simultaneously in a given market are 

  

   

in many markets we also directly supply key accounts including gas stations retail chains and supermarkets 

  

our distribution and sales systems are supported by sales forces that total approximately 20700 employees worldwide our sales forces are well trained and recognized by trade surveys for their professionalism 

our products are marketed and promoted through various media and channels including where permitted by law point of sale communications brand events accessrestricted web sites print and direct communication to verified adult smokers our direct communication with verified adult smokers utilizes mail email and other electronic communication tools promotional activities include where permitted by law competitions invitations to events interactive programs consumer premiums and price promotions to support advertising and promotional activities in the markets we have a dedicated consumer engagement group that develops innovative engagement tools for adult smokers based on the latest technologies and adult smoker trends 

  

competition 

  

we are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business we compete primarily on the basis of product quality brand recognition brand loyalty taste innovation packaging service marketing advertising and retail price our competitors include three large international tobacco companies and several regional and local tobacco companies and in some instances stateowned tobacco enterprises principally in algeria egypt the prc taiwan thailand and vietnam industry consolidation and privatizations of stateowned enterprises have led to an overall increase in competitive pressures some competitors have different profit and volume objectives and some international competitors are susceptible to changes in different currency exchange rates we compete predominantly with american blend cigarette brands such as marlboro  lm   parliament  and chesterfield  which are the most popular across many of our markets we seek to compete in all profitable retail price categories although our brand portfolio is weighted towards the premiumprice category 

  

procurement and raw materials 

  

we purchase tobacco leaf of various types grades and styles throughout the world the majority through independent tobacco suppliers we also contract directly with farmers in several countries including argentina brazil colombia the dominican republic ecuador italy kazakhstan mexico pakistan the philippines and poland direct sourcing from farmers represents approximately 35 of pmi’s global leaf requirements the largest supplies of tobacco leaf are sourced from brazil the united states indonesia mostly for domestic use in kretek products india china turkey greece argentina mozambique tanzania and malawi 

we believe that there is an adequate supply of tobacco leaf in the world markets to satisfy our current and anticipated production requirements 

  

in addition to tobacco leaf we purchase a wide variety of direct materials from a total of approximately 450 suppliers our top ten suppliers of direct materials combined represent approximately 57 of our total direct materials purchases the three most significant direct materials that we purchase are printed paper board used in packaging acetate tow used in filter making and fine paper used in cigarette manufacturing in addition the adequate supply and procurement of cloves are of particular importance to our indonesian business

research and development 

  

reducedrisk products   one of our strategic priorities is to develop assess and commercialize a portfolio of innovative products with the potential to reduce individual risk and population harm in comparison to smoking combustible cigarettes we refer to these as reducedrisk products or rrps the use of this term applies to tobaccocontaining products and other nicotinecontaining products that have the potential to reduce individual risk and population harm in comparison to smoking combustible cigarettes except for iqos  which was launched for pilots in nagoya japan and milan italy our rrps are in various stages of development we are conducting extensive and rigorous scientific studies to determine whether we can support claims for such products of reduced exposure to harmful and potentially harmful constituents in smoke and ultimately claims of reduced disease risk when compared to smoking combustible cigarettes before making any such claims we will need to rigorously evaluate the full set of data from the relevant scientific studies to determine whether they substantiate reduced risk any such claims may also be subject to government review and approval as is the case in the us today 

we draw upon a team of worldclass scientists from a broad spectrum of scientific disciplines whose efforts are guided by the following three key objectives 

 

 

 

in addition to iqos  we are developing three rrp platforms that are in various stages of commercialization readiness we are commercializing an evapor product under the nicocigs  brand name in the uk are also developing other potential platforms and are working on developing the next generation of evapor technology 

further information about our rrps is set forth in item 7 business environment  taxes legislation regulation and other matters regarding the manufacture marketing sale and use of tobacco products  reducedrisk products 

cigarette products   we conduct research to support and reinforce our combustible cigarette product business we seek to be at the forefront of innovation for product enhancements and launches of innovative new products we have also increased support for the 

 5 

combustible cigarette business because compliance with applicable laws and regulations is requiring additional capacity for analysis and testing 

finally working through biotechnology partners we conduct research and development on technology platforms that can potentially lead to the development of alternative uses of tobacco such as for the production of therapeutic molecules

risks related to our business and industry 

Ÿ cigarettes are subject to substantial taxes significant increases in cigaretterelated taxes have been proposed or enacted and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted in numerous jurisdictions these tax increases may disproportionately affect our profitability and make us less competitive versus certain of our competitors 

tax regimes including excise taxes sales taxes and import duties can disproportionately affect the retail price of manufactured cigarettes versus other tobacco products or disproportionately affect the relative retail price of our manufactured cigarette brands versus cigarette brands manufactured by certain of our competitors because our portfolio is weighted toward the premiumprice manufactured cigarette category tax regimes based on sales price can place us at a competitive disadvantage in certain markets as a result our volume and profitability may be adversely affected in these markets 

increases in cigarette taxes are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on our sales of cigarettes due to resulting lower consumption levels a shift in sales from manufactured cigarettes to other tobacco products and from the premiumprice to the midprice or lowprice cigarette categories where we may be underrepresented from local sales to legal crossborder purchases of lower price products or to illicit products such as contraband counterfeit and illicit whites 

Ÿ our business faces significant governmental action aimed at increasing regulatory requirements with the goal of reducing or preventing the use of tobacco products 

governmental actions combined with the diminishing social acceptance of smoking and private actions to restrict smoking have resulted in reduced industry volume in many of our markets and we expect that such factors will continue to reduce consumption levels and will increase downtrading and the risk of counterfeiting contraband illicit whites and legal crossborder purchases significant regulatory developments will take place over the next few years in most of our markets driven principally by the world health organizations framework convention on tobacco control “fctc” the fctc is the first international public health treaty on tobacco and its objective is to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation the fctc has led to increased efforts by tobacco control advocates and public health organizations to reduce the palatability and attractiveness of tobacco products to adult smokers regulatory initiatives that have been proposed introduced or enacted include 

 our operating income could be significantly affected by regulatory initiatives resulting in a significant decrease in demand for our brands in particular requirements that lead to a commoditization of tobacco products as well as any significant increase in the cost of complying with new regulatory requirements 

Ÿ litigation related to tobacco use and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke could substantially reduce our profitability and could severely impair our liquidity 

there is litigation related to tobacco products pending in certain jurisdictions damages claimed in some tobaccorelated litigation are significant and in certain cases in brazil canada and nigeria range into the billions of us dollars we anticipate that new cases will continue to be filed the fctc encourages litigation against tobacco product manufacturers it is possible that our consolidated results 

 8 

of operations cash flows or financial position could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation see item 3 legal proceedings  item 3 and item 8 note 21 contingencies  for a discussion of pending litigation 

Ÿ we face intense competition and our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations 

we compete primarily on the basis of product quality brand recognition brand loyalty taste innovation packaging service marketing advertising and price we are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business the competitive environment and our competitive position can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions erosion of consumer confidence competitors introduction of lowerprice products or innovative products higher tobacco product taxes higher absolute prices and larger gaps between retail price categories and product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate tobacco products competitors include three large international tobacco companies and several regional and local tobacco companies and in some instances stateowned tobacco enterprises principally in algeria china egypt taiwan thailand and vietnam industry consolidation and privatizations of stateowned enterprises have led to an overall increase in competitive pressures some competitors have different profit and volume objectives and some international competitors are susceptible to changes in different currency exchange rates 

Ÿ because we have operations in numerous countries our results may be influenced by economic regulatory and political developments natural disasters or conflicts 

some of the countries in which we operate face the threat of civil unrest and can be subject to regime changes in others nationalization terrorism conflict and the threat of war may have a significant impact on the business environment economic political regulatory or other developments or natural disasters could disrupt our supply chain manufacturing capabilities or our distribution capabilities in addition such developments could lead to loss of property or equipment that are critical to our business in certain markets and difficulty in staffing and managing our operations which could reduce our volumes revenues and net earnings 

there is an increasing number of conflicts including in the middle east and ukraine political uncertainty including potential effects from current or future economic sanctions by the us or other governments could lead to significant disruptions to our business 

in certain markets we are dependent on governmental approvals of various actions such as price changes and failure to obtain such approvals could impair growth in our profitability 

in addition despite our high ethical standards and rigorous control and compliance procedures aimed at preventing and detecting unlawful conduct given the breadth and scope of our international operations we may not be able to detect all potential improper or unlawful conduct by our employees and international partners 

Ÿ we may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences or to respond to consumer behavior influenced by economic downturns 

our tobacco business is subject to changes in consumer preferences which may be influenced by local economic conditions to be successful we must 

 in periods of economic uncertainty consumers may tend to purchase lowerprice brands and the volume of our premiumprice and midprice brands and our profitability could suffer accordingly such downtrading trends may be reinforced by regulation that limits branding communication and product differentiation 

Ÿ we lose revenues as a result of counterfeiting contraband crossborder purchases and nontaxpaid volume produced by local manufacturers 

large quantities of counterfeit cigarettes are sold in the international market we believe that marlboro  is the most heavily counterfeited international cigarette brand although we cannot quantify the revenues we lose as a result of this activity in addition our revenues are reduced by contraband legal crossborder purchases and nontaxpaid volume produced by local manufacturers 

 9 

Ÿ from time to time we are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters 

investigations include allegations of contraband shipments of cigarettes allegations of unlawful pricing activities within certain markets allegations of underpayment of customs duties andor excise taxes allegations of false and misleading usage of descriptors and allegations of unlawful advertising we cannot predict the outcome of those investigations or whether additional investigations may be commenced and it is possible that our business could be materially affected by an unfavorable outcome of pending or future investigations see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsoperating results by business segmentbusiness environmentgovernmental investigations  for a description of certain governmental investigations to which we are subject 

Ÿ we may be unsuccessful in our attempts to produce reducedrisk products and regulators may not permit reduced exposure or risk claims 

we continue to seek ways to develop commercially viable new product technologies with the potential to reduce exposure to harmful constituents in smoke and individual risk and population harm in comparison to smoking combustible cigarettes our goal is to develop products whose potential to reduce exposure individual risk and population harm can be substantiated by rigorous scientific studies and that provide adult smokers the taste sensory experience nicotine delivery profile and ritual characteristics that are similar to those currently provided by combustible cigarettes we may not succeed in these efforts if we do not succeed but others do we may be at a competitive disadvantage furthermore we cannot predict whether regulators will permit the marketing of tobacco products or other nicotinecontaining products with claims of reduced exposure or disease risk a prohibition on any such claims could significantly undermine the commercial viability of these products 

Ÿ our reported results could be adversely affected by unfavorable currency exchange rates and currency devaluations could impair our competitiveness 

we conduct our business primarily in local currency and for purposes of financial reporting the local currency results are translated into us dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period during times of a strengthening us dollar our reported net revenues and operating income will be reduced because the local currency translates into fewer us dollars during periods of local economic crises foreign currencies may be devalued significantly against the us dollar reducing our margins actions to recover margins may result in lower volume and a weaker competitive position 

Ÿ the repatriation of our foreign earnings changes in the earnings mix and changes in us tax laws may increase our effective tax rate our ability to receive payments from foreign subsidiaries or to repatriate royalties and dividends could be restricted by local country currency exchange controls 

because we are a us holding company our most significant source of funds is distributions from our nonus subsidiaries under current us tax law in general we do not pay us taxes on our foreign earnings until they are repatriated to the us as distributions from our nonus subsidiaries these distributions may result in a residual us tax cost it may be advantageous to us in certain circumstances to significantly increase the amount of such distributions which could result in a material increase in our overall effective tax rate additionally the obama administration has indicated that it favors changes in us tax law that would fundamentally change how our earnings are taxed in the us if enacted and depending upon its precise terms such legislation could increase our overall effective tax rate certain countries in which we operate have adopted or could institute currency exchange controls that limit or prohibit our local subsidiaries ability to make payments outside the country 

Ÿ our ability to grow may be limited by our inability to introduce new products enter new markets or to improve our margins through higher pricing and improvements in our brand and geographic mix 

our profitability may suffer if we are unable to introduce new products or enter new markets successfully to raise prices or maintain an acceptable proportion of our sales of higher margin products and sales in higher margin geographies 

Ÿ we may be unable to expand our brand portfolio through successful acquisitions or the development of strategic business relationships 

one element of our growth strategy is to strengthen our brand portfolio and market positions through selective acquisitions and the development of strategic business relationships acquisition and strategic business development opportunities are limited and present risks of failing to achieve efficient and effective integration strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings there is no assurance that we will be able to acquire attractive businesses on favorable terms or that future acquisitions or strategic business developments will be accretive to earnings 

 10 

Ÿ government mandated prices production control programs shifts in crops driven by economic conditions and the impact of climate change may increase the cost or reduce the quality of the tobacco and other agricultural products used to manufacture our products 

as with other agricultural commodities the price of tobacco leaf and cloves can be influenced by imbalances in supply and demand and crop quality can be influenced by variations in weather patterns including those caused by climate change tobacco production in certain countries is subject to a variety of controls including government mandated prices and production control programs changes in the patterns of demand for agricultural products could cause farmers to plant less tobacco any significant change in tobacco leaf and clove prices quality and quantity could affect our profitability and our business 

Ÿ our ability to implement our strategy of attracting and retaining the best global talent may be impaired by the decreasing social acceptance of cigarette smoking 

the tobacco industry competes for talent with consumer products and other companies that enjoy greater societal acceptance as a result we may be unable to attract and retain the best global talent 

Ÿ the failure of our information systems to function as intended or their penetration by outside parties with the intent to corrupt them could result in business disruption litigation and regulatory action and loss of revenue assets or personal or other sensitive data 

we use information systems to help manage business processes collect and interpret business data and communicate internally and externally with employees suppliers customers and others some of these information systems are managed by thirdparty service providers we have backup systems and business continuity plans in place and we take care to protect our systems and data from unauthorized access nevertheless failure of our systems to function as intended or penetration of our systems by outside parties intent on extracting or corrupting information or otherwise disrupting business processes could result in loss of revenue assets or personal or other sensitive data litigation and regulatory action cause damage to our reputation and that of our brands and result in significant remediation and other costs to us 

Ÿ we may be required to replace thirdparty contract manufacturers or service providers with our own resources 

in certain instances we contract with third parties to manufacture some of our products or product parts or to provide other services we may be unable to renew these agreements on satisfactory terms for numerous reasons including government regulations accordingly our costs may increase significantly if we must replace such third parties with our own resources

at december 31 2014  we operated and owned 50  manufacturing facilities and maintained contract manufacturing relationships with 23 thirdparty manufacturers across 23 markets in addition we work with 38 thirdparty operators in indonesia who manufacture our handrolled cigarettes 

  

pmiowned manufacturing facilities 

  



  

in 2014  25 of our facilities each manufactured over 10 billion cigarettes of which six facilities each produced over 30 billion units our largest factories are in st petersburg and krasnodar russia marikina and batangas philippines izmir turkey berlin germany

krakow poland sukorejo and karawang indonesia merlo argentina kharkiv ukraine and guadalajara mexico our smallest factories are mostly in latin america and asia where due to tariff and other constraints we have established small manufacturing units in individual markets several of which are makepack operations we will continue to optimize our manufacturing base taking into consideration the evolution of trade blocks 

  

the plants and properties owned or leased and operated by our subsidiaries are maintained in good condition and are believed to be suitable and adequate for our present needs 

in 2012 we announced that we are working on all aspects that will lead to the commercialization of rrps in the 2016 to 2017 period on january 10 2014 we announced an investment of up to €500 million to develop our first manufacturing facility in the european union and an associated pilot plant near bologna italy to produce rrps on october 10 2014 the pilot plant officially opened for production once fully operational by 2016 the factory and pilot plant combined annual production capacity is expected to reach up to 30 billion units

tobaccorelated litigation 

  

legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened against us andor our subsidiaries andor our indemnitees in various jurisdictions our indemnitees include distributors licensees and others that have been named as parties in certain cases and that we have agreed to defend as well as to pay costs and some or all of judgments if any that may be entered against them pursuant to the terms of the distribution agreement between altria and pmi pmi will indemnify altria and philip morris usa inc pm usa a us tobacco subsidiary of altria for tobacco product claims based in substantial part on products manufactured by pmi or contract manufactured for pmi by pm usa and pm usa will indemnify pmi for tobacco product claims based in substantial part on products manufactured by pm usa excluding tobacco products contract manufactured for pmi 

it is possible that there could be adverse developments in pending cases against us and our subsidiaries an unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobaccorelated litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation 

damages claimed in some of the tobaccorelated litigation are significant and in certain cases in brazil canada and nigeria range into the billions of us dollars the variability in pleadings in multiple jurisdictions together with the actual experience of management in litigating claims demonstrate that the monetary relief that may be specified in a lawsuit bears little relevance to the ultimate outcome much of the tobaccorelated litigation is in its early stages and litigation is subject to uncertainty however as discussed below we have to date been largely successful in defending tobaccorelated litigation 

we and our subsidiaries record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated at the present time while it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur after assessing the information available to it i management has not concluded that it is probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending tobaccorelated cases ii management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss for any of the pending tobaccorelated cases and iii accordingly no estimated loss has been accrued in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes in these cases if any legal defense costs are expensed as incurred 

it is possible that our consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation nevertheless although litigation is subject to uncertainty we and each of our subsidiaries named as a defendant believe and each has been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases that we have valid defenses to the litigation pending against us as well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts if any all such cases are and will continue to be vigorously defended however we and our subsidiaries may enter into settlement discussions in particular cases if we believe it is in our best interests to do so 

to date we have paid one judgment in a tobaccorelated case that judgment including costs was approximately €1400 approximately 1800 and that payment was made in order to appeal an italian small claims case which was subsequently reversed on appeal to date no tobaccorelated case has been finally resolved in favor of a plaintiff against us our subsidiaries or indemnitees 

 12 

the table below lists the number of tobaccorelated cases pending against us andor our subsidiaries or indemnitees as of february 15 2015 december 31 2013  and december 31 2012  

  



since 1995 when the first tobaccorelated litigation was filed against a pmi entity 433 smoking and health lights health care cost recovery and public civil actions in which we andor one of our subsidiaries andor indemnitees were a defendant have been terminated in our favor ten cases have had decisions in favor of plaintiffs nine of these cases have subsequently reached final resolution in our favor and one remains on appeal

the table below lists the verdicts and posttrial developments in the following cases where verdicts were returned in favor of plaintiffs

smoking and health litigation  these cases primarily allege personal injury and are brought by individual plaintiffs or on behalf of a class or purported class of individual plaintiffs plaintiffs allegations of liability in these cases are based on various theories of recovery including negligence gross negligence strict liability fraud misrepresentation design defect failure to warn breach of express and implied warranties violations of deceptive trade practice laws and consumer protection statutes plaintiffs in these cases seek various forms of relief including compensatory and other damages and injunctive and equitable relief defenses raised in these cases include licit activity failure to state a claim lack of defect lack of proximate cause assumption of the risk contributory negligence and statute of limitations

executive summary 

the following executive summary provides significant highlights from the discussion and analysis that follows 

 

see the discussion of events affecting the comparability of statement of earnings amounts in the consolidated operating results section of the following discussion and analysis 

 

on april 4 2014 we announced the initiation by our affiliate philip morris holland bv pmh of consultations with employee representatives on a proposal to discontinue cigarette production at its factory located in bergen op zoom the netherlands pmh reached an agreement with the trade unions and their members on a social plan and ceased cigarette production on september 1 2014 pmi expects to incur a total pretax charge of approximately 547 million for the total program during 2014 we recorded pretax asset impairment and exist costs of 489 million for further details see the asset impairment and exit costs section of the following discussion and analysis

for further details see the consolidated operating results  and operating results by business segment  sections of the following discussion and analysis  

• 2015 forecasted results –  on february 5 2015 we announced our forecast for 2015 fullyear reported diluted eps to be in a range of 427 to 437 at prevailing exchange rates at that time versus 476  in 2014 excluding an unfavorable currency impact at thenprevailing rates of approximately 115 per share for the fullyear 2015 the reported diluted earnings per share range represents an increase of 8 to 10 versus adjusted diluted earnings per share of 502  in 2014 this forecast includes incremental spending versus 2014 for our reducedrisk product iqos  the spending which is skewed towards the second half of the year will support our plans for national expansion in japan and italy as well as pilot or national launches in additional markets later in 2015 this forecast does not include any share repurchases in 2015 the company will revisit the potential for repurchases as the year unfolds depending on the currency environment 

we calculated 2014 adjusted diluted eps as reported diluted eps of 476  plus the 026  per share charge related to asset impairment and exit costs 

adjusted diluted eps is not a measure under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap we define adjusted diluted eps as reported diluted eps adjusted for asset impairment and exit costs discrete tax items and unusual items we believe it is appropriate to disclose this measure as it represents core earnings improves comparability and helps investors analyze business performance and trends adjusted diluted eps should be considered neither in isolation nor as a substitute for reported diluted eps prepared in accordance with us gaap 

this 2015 guidance excludes the impact of future acquisitions unanticipated asset impairment and exit cost charges future changes in currency exchange rates and any unusual events the factors described in item 1a risk factors represent continuing risks to this forecast 

discussion and analysis 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

item 8 note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in most instances we must use a particular accounting policy or method because it is the only one that is permitted under us gaap 

the preparation of financial statements requires that we use estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets liabilities net revenues and expenses as well as our disclosure of contingencies if actual amounts differ from previous estimates we include the revisions in our consolidated results of operations in the period during which we know the actual amounts historically aggregate differences if any between our estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 

 26 

the selection and disclosure of our critical accounting policies and estimates have been discussed with our audit committee the following is a discussion of the more significant assumptions estimates accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

• revenue recognition –  as required by us gaap we recognize revenues net of sales and promotion incentives our net revenues include excise taxes and shipping and handling charges billed to our customers our net revenues are recognized upon shipment or delivery of goods when title and risk of loss pass to our customers we record shipping and handling costs paid to third parties as part of cost of sales 

• goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets valuation – we test goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets annually for impairment or more frequently if events occur that would warrant such review we perform our annual impairment analysis in the first quarter of each year the impairment analysis involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit or nonamortizable intangible asset to the carrying value if the carrying value exceeds the fair value goodwill or a nonamortizable intangible asset is considered impaired to determine the fair value of goodwill we primarily use a discounted cash flow model supported by the market approach using earnings multiples of comparable companies to determine the fair value of nonamortizable intangible assets we primarily use a discounted cash flow model applying the relieffromroyalty method these discounted cash flow models include management assumptions relevant for forecasting operating cash flows which are subject to changes in business conditions such as volumes and prices costs to produce discount rates and estimated capital needs management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the fair values are estimated and we believe these assumptions are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use we concluded that the fair value of our reporting units and nonamortizable intangible assets exceeded the carrying value and any reasonable movement in the assumptions would not result in an impairment since the march 28 2008 spinoff from altria group inc altria we have not recorded a charge to earnings for an impairment of goodwill or nonamortizable intangible assets 

• marketing and advertising costs –  as required by us gaap we record marketing costs as an expense in the year to which costs relate we do not defer amounts on our balance sheet we expense advertising costs during the year in which the costs are incurred we record trade promotion costs as a reduction of revenues during the year in which these programs are offered relying on estimates of utilization and redemption rates that have been developed from historical information such programs include but are not limited to discounts rebates instore display incentives and volumebased incentives for interim reporting purposes advertising and certain consumer incentives are charged to earnings based on estimated sales and related expenses for the full year 

• employee benefit plans – as discussed in item 8 note 13 benefit plans  to our consolidated financial statements we provide a range of benefits to our employees and retired employees including pensions postretirement health care and postemployment benefits primarily severance we record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by us gaap these calculations include various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates assumed rates of return on plan assets compensation increases and turnover rates we review actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so as permitted by us gaap any effect of the modifications is generally amortized over future periods we believe that the assumptions utilized in calculating our obligations under these plans are reasonable based upon advice from our actuaries 

at december 31 2014  our discount rate was 395 for our us pension plans and 410 for our us postretirement plans these rates were 85 basis points lower than our 2013 discount rate of 480 for us pension plans and 495  for us postretirement plans our weightedaverage discount rate assumption for our nonus pension plans decreased to 192  from 309  at december 31 2013  our weightedaverage discount rate assumption for our nonus postretirement plans was 428  at december 31 2014  and 507  at december 31 2013  we anticipate that assumption changes coupled with increased amortization of deferred losses will increase 2015 pretax us and nonus pension and postretirement expense to approximately 246 million as compared with approximately 207 million in 2014 excluding amounts related to early retirement programs a fiftybasispoint decrease in our discount rate would increase our 2015 pension and postretirement expense by approximately 55 million and a fiftybasispoint increase in our discount rate would decrease our 2015 pension and postretirement expense by approximately 45 million similarly a fiftybasispoint decrease increase in the expected return on plan assets would increase decrease our 2015 pension expense by approximately 30 million 

see item 8 note 13 benefit plans  to our consolidated financial statements for a sensitivity discussion of the assumed health care cost trend rates 

• income taxes –  income tax provisions for jurisdictions outside the united states as well as state and local income tax provisions are determined on a separate company basis and the related assets and liabilities are recorded in our consolidated balance sheets 

 27 

the extent of our operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions the final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal state and international tax audits in accordance with the authoritative guidance for income taxes we evaluate potential tax exposures and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment an additional charge to expense would result if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 

the effective tax rates used for interim reporting are based on our fullyear geographic earnings mix projections and cash repatriation plans changes in currency exchange rates earnings mix by taxing jurisdiction or in cash repatriation plans could have an impact on the effective tax rates which we monitor each quarter significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions 

at december 31 2014  applicable united states federal income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on approximately 23 billion of accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are expected to be permanently reinvested these earnings have been or will be invested to support the growth of our international business further we do not foresee a need to repatriate these earnings to the us since our us cash requirements are supported by distributions from foreign entities of earnings that have not been designated as permanently reinvested and existing credit facilities repatriation of earnings from foreign subsidiaries for which we have asserted that the earnings are permanently reinvested would result in additional us income and foreign withholding taxes the determination of the amount of deferred tax related to these earnings is not practicable due to the complexity of the us foreign tax credit regime as well as differences between earnings determined for book and tax purposes mainly resulting from intercompany transactions purchase accounting and currency fluctuations 

prior to the spinoff of pmi by altria we were a wholly owned subsidiary of altria we participated in a taxsharing agreement with altria for us tax liabilities and our accounts were included with those of altria for purposes of its us federal income tax return under the terms of the agreement taxes were computed on a separate company basis to the extent that we generated foreign tax credits capital losses and other credits that could not be utilized on a separate company basis but were utilized in altria’s consolidated us federal income tax return we would recognize the resulting benefit in the calculation of our provision for income taxes we made payments to or were reimbursed by altria for the tax effects resulting from our inclusion in altria’s consolidated united states federal income tax return on the date of the spinoff of pmi by altria we entered into a tax sharing agreement with altria the tax sharing agreement generally governs altria’s and our respective rights responsibilities and obligations for predistribution periods and for potential taxes on the spinoff of pmi by altria with respect to any potential tax resulting from the spinoff of pmi by altria responsibility for the tax will be allocated to the party that acted or failed to act in a manner that resulted in the tax beginning march 31 2008 we were no longer a member of the altria consolidated tax return group and we filed our own us federal consolidated income tax return 

for further details see item 8 note 11 income taxes  to our consolidated financial statements 

• hedging – as discussed below in “market risk” we use derivative financial instruments principally to reduce exposures to market risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates by creating offsetting exposures for derivatives to which we have elected to apply hedge accounting gains and losses on these derivatives are initially deferred in accumulated other comprehensive losses on the consolidated balance sheet and recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings in the periods when the related hedged transactions are also recognized in operating results if we had elected not to use the hedge accounting provisions gains losses deferred in stockholders’ deficit equity would have been recorded in our net earnings for these derivatives 

• contingencies – as discussed in item 8 note 21 contingencies  to our consolidated financial statements legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened against us andor our subsidiaries andor our indemnitees in various jurisdictions we and our subsidiaries record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated the variability in pleadings in multiple jurisdictions together with the actual experience of management in litigating claims demonstrate that the monetary relief that may be specified in a lawsuit bears little relevance to the ultimate outcome much of the tobaccorelated litigation is in its early stages and litigation is subject to uncertainty at the present time while it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur after assessing the information available to it i management has not concluded that it is probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending tobaccorelated cases ii management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss for any of the pending tobaccorelated cases and iii accordingly no estimated loss has been accrued in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes in these cases if any legal defense costs are expensed as incurred

as discussed in item 8 note 12 segment reporting  to our consolidated financial statements we evaluate segment performance and allocate resources based on operating companies income which we define as operating income excluding general corporate expenses and amortization of intangibles plus equity incomeloss in unconsolidated subsidiaries net we believe it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze the business performance and trends of our various business segments

 the overall declines were partially offset by 

 

our market share increased or was flat in a number of key markets including algeria argentina austria canada france germany italy korea the netherlands the philippines poland russia saudi arabia spain switzerland and the united kingdom 

 30 

total cigarette shipments of marlboro  of 2830 billion  units decreased  by 28  due primarily to declines in the european union notably france italy and poland partly offset by the czech republic and spain eema notably in egypt russia and ukraine partly offset by algeria and saudi arabia asia due almost entirely to japan partly offset by the philippines and latin america  canada due predominantly to mexico the overall decline was partially offset by the positive impact of market share growth in the european union and eema regions market share of marlboro  in asia and latin america  canada was flat 

total cigarette shipments of parliament  of 472 billion  units increased by 56  driven by growth in all regions and notably in turkey total cigarette shipments of lm  of 942 billion  units were down  by 09  due primarily to eema notably saudi arabia and turkey partially offset by slightly increased or essentially flat shipments in the three other regions total cigarette shipments of bond street  of 436 billion  units decreased  by 29  due predominantly to kazakhstan serbia and ukraine partially offset by australia and russia total cigarette shipments of philip morris  of 319 billion  units decreased  by 87  due almost entirely to japan principally reflecting the morphing to lark  partly offset by growth in the three other regions total cigarette shipments of chesterfield  of 421 billion  units increased by 226  driven by growth in all regions and notably in italy poland and turkey partly offset by russia and ukraine total cigarette shipments of lark  of 285 billion  units decreased  by 13  due predominantly to turkey partly offset by japan including the impact of the morphing of philip morris  

our other tobacco products otp primarily include tobacco for rollyourown and makeyourown cigarettes pipe tobacco cigars and cigarillos total shipment volume of otp in cigarette equivalent units increased  by 34  to 338 billion  cigarette equivalent units mainly due to growth in the fine cut category notably in belgium the czech republic hungary and poland partially offset by france and germany 

total shipment volume for cigarettes and otp in cigarette equivalent units was down  by 25  

our net revenues and excise taxes on products were as follows 



currency movements decreased net revenues by 53 billion  and net revenues excluding excise taxes on products by 21 billion  due primarily to the argentine peso indonesian rupiah japanese yen russian ruble turkish lira and the ukraine hryvnia partially offset by the euro 

net revenues include  2017 million  in 2014  and 1876 million in 2013  related to sales of otp these net revenue amounts include excise taxes billed to customers excluding excises taxes net revenues for otp were  753 million  in 2014  and 739 million in 2013  

net revenues which include excise taxes billed to customers increased  by 77 million   01  excluding excise taxes net revenues decreased  by 1450 million   46  to 298 billion  this decrease  was due to 

 

excise taxes on products increased  by 15 billion   31  due primarily to 

• higher excise taxes resulting from changes in retail prices and tax rates  55 billion  partly offset by 

• favorable currency  33 billion  and 

• volumemix  755 million  

governments have consistently increased excise taxes in most of the markets in which we operate as discussed in business environment  we expect excise taxes to continue to increase 

 31 

our cost of sales marketing administration and research costs and operating income were as follows 



cost of sales increased   26 million   02  due to 

 

marketing administration and research costs increased  by 111 million   16  due to 

 

operating income decreased  by 18 billion   134  this decrease  was due primarily to 

 

interest expense net of 11 billion   increased   79 million  due primarily to higher average debt levels partially offset by lower average interest rates on debt 

our effective tax rate decreased  by 02  percentage points to 291  the 2014  effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by the asset impairment and exit costs related to the factory closures the 2013  effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by the additional expense associated with the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 17 million and the enactment of tax law changes in mexico 14 million the effective tax rate is based on our fullyear earnings mix by taxing jurisdiction and cash repatriation plans changes in our cash repatriation plans could have an impact on the effective tax rate which we monitor each quarter significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions based upon tax regulations in existence at december 31 2014  and our cash repatriation plans we estimate that our 2015  effective tax rate will be approximately 29 

we are regularly examined by tax authorities around the world and we are currently under examination in a number of jurisdictions it is reasonably possible that within the next twelve months certain tax examinations will close which could result in a change in unrecognized tax benefits along with related interest and penalties an estimate of any possible charge cannot be made at this time 

equity incomeloss in unconsolidated subsidiaries net of 105 million  increased by 127 million  due primarily to higher earnings from our investments in north africa and russia which are reflected in the eastern europe middle east  africa segment 

 32 

net earnings attributable to pmi of 75 billion   decreased  by 11 billion   126  this decrease  was due primarily to an unfavorable currency impact on operating income and higher interest expense net diluted and basic eps of 476   decreased  by 95  excluding an unfavorable currency impact of 080  diluted eps increased by 57  

2013  compared with 2012 

the following discussion compares our consolidated operating results for the year ended december 31 2013 with the year ended december 31 2012 

our cigarette shipment volume of 8802 billion units decreased by 51 or 469 billion units driven by a total industry taxpaid volume decline the decline in our cigarette shipment volume mainly reflected 

 environment the growth of the otp category and the prevalence of ecigarettes and nonduty paid products 

 

 

 

excluding the philippines our cigarette shipment volume was down by 27 and our total tobacco volume including otp in cigarette equivalent units was down by 24 

our market share grew in a number of key markets including algeria argentina belgium brazil canada colombia egypt france germany greece indonesia italy korea the netherlands poland portugal saudi arabia spain thailand ukraine and the united kingdom 

total cigarette shipments of marlboro  of 2911 billion units decreased by 35 due primarily to declines in the european union notably france poland and spain partly offset by italy eema primarily romania russia turkey and ukraine largely offset by north africa asia predominantly japan and the philippines partly offset by indonesia and latin america  canada mainly argentina and brazil partly offset by colombia and mexico excluding the philippines total cigarette shipments of marlboro  declined by 13 

total cigarette shipments of lm  of 950 billion units were up by 14 driven notably by egypt russia and saudi arabia partly offset by turkey total cigarette shipments of bond street  of 449 billion units decreased by 42 due primarily to russia and ukraine total cigarette shipments of parliament  of 447 billion units were up by 29 due primarily to turkey partly offset by japan total cigarette shipments of philip morris  of 350 billion units decreased by 79 due primarily to italy and the philippines partly offset by argentina total cigarette shipments of chesterfield  of 344 billion units were down by 32 due primarily to russia and ukraine partly offset by germany and turkey total cigarette shipments of lark  of 288 billion units decreased by 102 due predominantly to japan and turkey 

total shipment volume of otp in cigarette equivalent units grew by 49 to 327 billion cigarette equivalent units primarily reflecting growth in the european union notably in belgium france hungary and italy 

total shipment volume for cigarettes and otp combined was down by 47 

 33 

our net revenues and excise taxes on products were as follows 



currency movements decreased net revenues by 14 billion and net revenues excluding excise taxes on products by 765 million the 765 million decrease was due primarily to the argentine peso australian dollar brazilian real indonesian rupiah japanese yen russian ruble and turkish lira partially offset by the euro and mexican peso 

net revenues include 1876 million in 2013 and 1709 million in 2012 related to sales of otp these net revenue amounts include excise taxes billed to customers excluding excises taxes net revenues for otp were 739 million in 2013 and 676 million in 2012 

net revenues which include excise taxes billed to customers increased by 26 billion 34 excluding excise taxes net revenues decreased by 160 million 05 to 312 billion this decrease was due to 

 

excise taxes on products increased by 28 billion 61 due to 

 

our cost of sales marketing administration and research costs and operating income were as follows 



cost of sales increased 37 million 04 due to 

   

marketing administration and research costs decreased by 71 million 10 due to 

 

operating income decreased by 348 million 25 this decrease was due primarily to 

  34 

 

interest expense net of 973 million increased 114 million due primarily to higher average debt levels partially offset by lower average interest rates on debt 

our effective tax rate decreased by 02 percentage points to 293 the 2013 effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by the additional expense associated with the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 17 million and the enactment of tax law changes in mexico 14 million the 2012 effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by an additional income tax provision of 79 million following the conclusion of the irs examination of altrias consolidated tax returns for the years 20042006 partially offset by a 40 million benefit from a tax accounting method change in germany 

net earnings attributable to pmi of 86 billion decreased 224 million 25 this decrease was due primarily to an unfavorable currency impact on operating income and higher interest expense net partially offset by a lower effective tax rate diluted and basic eps of 526 increased by 17 excluding an unfavorable currency impact of 034 diluted eps increased by 83 

operating results by business segment 

business environment 

taxes legislation regulation and other matters regarding the manufacture marketing sale and use of tobacco products 

the tobacco industry and our business face a number of challenges that may adversely affect our business volume results of operations cash flows and financial position these challenges which are discussed below and in item 1a risk factors  include 

 

Ÿ fctc   the world health organizations “who” framework convention on tobacco control “fctc” an international public health treaty with the objective of reducing tobacco use drives much of the regulation that shapes the business environment in which we operate the treaty to which 178 countries and the european union are parties requires parties to have in place various tobacco control measures and recommends others 

we support many of the regulatory policies required by the fctc including measures that strictly prohibit the sale of tobacco products to minors limit public smoking require health warnings on tobacco packaging regulate product content to prevent increased adverse health effects of smoking and establish a regulatory framework for reducedrisk products we also support the use of tax and price policies to achieve public health objectives as long as tax increases are not excessive disruptive or discriminatory and do not result in increased illicit trade 

however the fctc governing body the conference of the parties “cop” has adopted nonbinding guidelines and policy recommendations to certain articles of the fctc some of which we strongly oppose including extreme measures such as pointofsale display bans plain packaging bans on all forms of communications with adult smokers ingredient restrictions or bans based on the concepts of palatability or attractiveness and excessive taxation among other things these measures would limit our ability to differentiate our products and disrupt competition are not based on sound evidence of a public health benefit are likely to lead to adverse consequences such as increased illicit trade and in some cases result in the expropriation of our trademarks and violate international treaties 

it is not possible to predict whether or to what extent measures recommended in the fctc guidelines will be implemented in some instances where these extreme measures have been adopted by national governments we have commenced legal proceedings challenging them 

 35 

Ÿ   excise sales and other taxes   excessive and disruptive tax increases and discriminatory tax structures are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on our profitability due to lower consumption and consumer downtrading from premium to nonpremium discount other lowprice or lowtaxed tobacco products such as fine cut tobacco and illicit products in addition in certain jurisdictions our products are subject to tax structures that discriminate against premiumprice products and manufactured cigarettes other jurisdictions have imposed or are seeking to impose levies or other taxes on tobacco companies we oppose such extreme tax measures we believe that they undermine public health by encouraging consumers to turn to the illicit trade for cheaper tobacco products and ultimately undercut government revenue objectives disrupt the competitive environment and encourage criminal activity 

Ÿ   eu tobacco products directive  in april 2014 the eu adopted the text of a significantly revised eu tobacco products directive that among other things provides for 

  

   

the revised directive entered into force in may 2014 member states are required to implement the directive by may 2016 

in june 2014 two of our subsidiaries filed papers in the english high court seeking judicial review of whether the directive complies with existing eu treaties in november 2014 the english high court referred the case to the court of justice of the european union “cjeu” and requested that the cjeu issue a judgment in advance of may 2016 in july 2014 the government of poland filed a complaint with the cjeu challenging the validity of various provisions in the directive that ban menthol cigarettes it is not possible to predict the outcome of these legal proceedings 

Ÿ   plain packaging to date only australia has implemented plain packaging its regulation which came into force in december 2012 bans the use of branding logos and colors on packaging of all tobacco products other than the brand name and variant which may be printed only in specified locations and in a uniform font the remainder of the pack is reserved for health warnings and government messages about cessation the branding of individual cigarettes is also prohibited under this regulation 

in other countries including ireland new zealand and the uk proposals to implement plain packaging are in various stages of the legislative process additionally several countries including turkey and norway are considering plain packaging but no legislative proposals have been published it is not possible to predict whether any of these countries will implement plain packaging 

australia’s plain packaging legislation triggered three legal challenges first major tobacco manufacturers including our australian subsidiary challenged the legislation’s constitutionality in the high court of australia although the high court found the legislation constitutional a majority of the justices concluded that plain packaging deprives tobacco manufacturers of their property raising serious questions about the legality of similar proposals in other jurisdictions second our hong kong subsidiary has initiated arbitration proceedings against the australian government pursuant to the hong kongaustralia bilateral investment treaty and is seeking substantial compensation for the deprivation of its investments in australia third several countries have initiated world trade organization wto dispute settlement proceedings against australia the ongoing legal challenges may take several years to complete and it is not possible to predict their outcomes 

we oppose plain packaging because it expropriates our valuable intellectual property by taking away our trademarks and moves the industry much closer to a commodity business where there is no distinction between brands and therefore the ability to compete for adult smoker market share is greatly reduced data from australia appear to confirm that with plain packaging adult smokers downtrade to lower price and lower margin brands and illicit products according to recent industrycommissioned studies the implementation of plain packaging in australia has had no impact on smoking prevalence among adults or youth while illicit trade has increased with 

 36 

a significant shift towards branded illicit products away from unbranded loose tobacco in the event any particular jurisdiction adopts plain packaging regulation we will consider all available options including litigation to ensure the protection of our intellectual property 

Ÿ   restrictions and bans on the use of ingredients currently the who and some others in the public health community recommend restrictions or total bans on the use of some or all ingredients in tobacco products including menthol some regulators have considered and rejected such proposals while others have proposed and in a few cases adopted restrictions or bans in particular as mentioned above the european union has adopted a ban of characterizing flavors in tobacco products subject to an exemption until may 2020 for menthol while sweeping ingredient bans have been adopted only by canada with an exemption for menthol and brazil 

however the brazil ingredients ban which as originally drafted would prohibit the use of virtually all ingredients with flavoring or aromatic properties is not in force due to a legal challenge by a tobacco industry union of which our brazilian subsidiary is a member it is not possible to predict the outcome of this legal proceeding 

broad restrictions and bans on the use of ingredients would require us to reformulate our american blend tobacco products and could reduce our ability to differentiate these products in the market in the long term menthol bans would eliminate the entire category of mentholated tobacco products we oppose broad bans or sweeping restrictions on the use of ingredients as they are often based on the subjective and scientifically unsupported notion that ingredients make tobacco products more “attractive” or “palatable” and therefore could encourage tobacco consumption and also because prohibiting entire categories of cigarettes such as menthol will lead to a massive increase in illicit trade 

many countries have enacted or proposed legislation or regulations that require cigarette manufacturers to disclose to governments and to the public the ingredients used in the manufacture of tobacco products and in certain cases to provide toxicological information about those ingredients we have made and will continue to make full disclosures where adequate assurances of trade secret protection are provided 

Ÿ   bans on display of tobacco products at retail  in a few of our markets governments have banned or propose to ban the display of tobacco products at the point of retail sale other countries have rejected display ban proposals we oppose display bans because they restrict competition by favoring established brands and encourage illicit trade while not reducing smoking or otherwise benefiting public health in some markets our subsidiaries and in some cases individual retailers have commenced legal proceedings to overturn display bans 

Ÿ   health warning requirements in most countries governments require large and often graphic health warnings covering at least 30 of the front and back of cigarette packs the size mandated by the fctc a growing number of countries require warnings covering 50 of the front and back of the pack and a small number of countries require larger warnings such as australia 75 front and 90 back mexico 30 front and 100 back uruguay 80 front and back and canada 75 front and back 

in march 2013 the ministry of public health in thailand issued a regulation mandating health warnings covering 85 of the front and back of cigarette packs while a lower court suspended this requirement pending the outcome of legal challenges by two of our affiliates thailand’s supreme administrative court recently overturned this order and allowed the regulation to be implemented during the pendency of our affiliates’ claims the legal challenges by our affiliates are still pending it is not possible to predict the outcome of these proceedings 

we support health warning requirements designed to inform consumers of the risks of smoking in fact where health warnings are not required we place them on packaging voluntarily in the official language or languages of the country we defer to governments on the content of warnings except for content that vilifies tobacco companies or does not fairly represent the actual effects of smoking however we oppose excessively large health warnings ie larger than 50 the data show that disproportionately increasing the size of health warnings does not effectively reduce tobacco consumption yet such health warnings impede our ability to compete in the market by leaving insufficient space for our distinctive trademarks and pack designs 

Ÿ   other packaging restrictions  some governments have passed or are seeking to pass restrictions on packaging and labeling including standardizing the shape format and layout of packaging as well as imposing broad restrictions on how the space left for branding and product descriptions can be used examples include prohibitions on 1 the use of colors that are alleged to suggest that one brand is less harmful than others 2 specific descriptive phrases deemed to be misleading including for example “premium” “full flavor” “international” “gold” “silver” and “menthol” and 3 in one country all but one pack variation per brand we oppose broad packaging restrictions because they unnecessarily limit brand and product differentiation are anticompetitive prevent us from providing consumers with information about our products unduly restrict our intellectual property rights and violate international trade agreements in some instances we have commenced litigation challenging such regulations it is not possible to predict the outcome of these proceedings 

 37 

Ÿ   bans and restrictions on advertising marketing promotions and sponsorships for many years the fctc has called for and countries have imposed partial or total bans on tobacco advertising marketing promotions and sponsorships including bans and restrictions on advertising on radio and television in print and on the internet the fctc also requires disclosure of expenditures on advertising promotion and sponsorship where such activities are not prohibited the fctc guidelines recommend that governments adopt extreme and sweeping prohibitions including all forms of communications to adult smokers where restrictions on advertising prevent us from communicating directly and effectively with adult smokers they impede our ability to compete in the market for this reason and because we believe that the available evidence does not show that marketing restrictions effectively reduce smoking we oppose complete bans on advertising and communications that do not allow manufacturers to communicate directly and effectively with adult smokers 

Ÿ   restrictions on product design antitobacco organizations and some regulators are calling for the further standardization of tobacco products by requiring for example that cigarettes have a certain minimum diameter which amounts to a ban on slim cigarettes or requiring the use of standardized filter and cigarette paper designs we oppose such restrictions because they limit our ability to differentiate our products and because we believe that there is no correlation let alone a causal link between product design variations and smoking rates nor is there any scientific evidence that these restrictions would improve public health 

reduced cigarette ignition propensity standards are recommended by the fctc guidelines have been adopted in several of our markets eg australia canada south africa and the eu and are being considered in several others 

Ÿ   restrictions on public smoking the pace and scope of public smoking restrictions have increased significantly in most of our markets many countries around the world have adopted or are likely to adopt regulations that restrict or ban smoking in public andor work places restaurants bars and nightclubs some public health groups have called for and some regional governments and municipalities have adopted or proposed bans on smoking in outdoor places as well as bans on smoking in cars typically when minors are present and private homes the fctc requires parties to adopt restrictions on public smoking and the guidelines call for broad bans in all indoor public places but limit their recommendations on private place smoking such as in cars and private homes to increased education on the risk of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke 

while we believe outright bans are appropriate in many public places such as schools playgrounds youth facilities and many indoor public places governments can and should seek a balance between the desire to protect nonsmokers from environmental tobacco smoke and allowing adults who choose to smoke to do so owners of restaurants bars cafes and other entertainment establishments should have the flexibility to permit restrict or prohibit smoking and workplaces should be permitted to provide designated smoking rooms for adult smokers finally we oppose bans on smoking outdoors beyond places and facilities for children and in private places 

Ÿ   other regulatory issues   some regulators are considering or in some cases have adopted regulatory measures designed to reduce the supply of tobacco these include regulations intended to reduce the number of retailers selling tobacco by for example reducing the overall number of tobacco retail licenses available or banning the sale of tobacco within arbitrary distances of certain public facilities we oppose such measures because they stimulate illicit trade and could arbitrarily deprive business owners and their employees of their livelihood with no indication that such restrictions would improve public health 

regulators in some countries have also called for the exclusion of tobacco from free trade agreements such as the transpacific partnership agreement which is under negotiation this could limit our ability to protect investments and intellectual property through these treaties we oppose such measures because they unfairly discriminate against a legal industry and are at odds with fundamental principles of global trade 

in a limited number of markets most notably japan we are dependent on governmental approvals that may limit our pricing flexibility 

Ÿ   illicit trade the   illicit tobacco trade creates a cheap and unregulated supply of tobacco products undermines efforts to reduce smoking especially among youth damages legitimate businesses stimulates organized crime increases corruption and reduces government tax revenue illicit trade may account for as much as 10 of global cigarette consumption this includes counterfeit contraband and the growing problem of illicit whites which are unique cigarette brands manufactured predominantly for smuggling we estimate that illicit trade in the european union accounted for more than 10 of total cigarette consumption in 2013 

a number of jurisdictions are considering regulatory measures and government action to prevent illicit trade in november 2012 the fctc adopted the protocol to eliminate illicit trade in tobacco products the “protocol” which includes supply chain control measures such as licensing of manufacturers and distributors enforcement in free trade zones controls on duty free and internet sales and the implementation of tracking and tracing technologies the protocol which we support will come into force once the fortieth country ratifies it after which countries must implement its measures via national legislation to date five countries have ratified the protocol it is not possible to predict whether other countries will do so 

 38 

additionally we and our subsidiaries have entered into cooperation agreements with governments and authorities to support their antiillicit trade efforts for example in 2004 we entered into a 12year cooperation agreement with the eu and its member states that provides for cooperation with european law enforcement agencies on anticontraband and on anticounterfeit efforts under the terms of this agreement we make financial contributions of approximately 75 million per year recorded as an expense in cost of sales when product is shipped to support these efforts we are also required to pay the excise taxes vat and customs duties on qualifying seizures of up to 450 million genuine pmi products in the eu in a given year and five times the applicable taxes and duties if seizures exceed this threshold in a given year to date our payments for product seizures have been immaterial 

in 2009 our colombian subsidiaries entered into an investment and cooperation agreement with the national and regional governments of colombia to promote investment in and cooperation on anticontraband and anticounterfeit efforts the agreement provides 200 million in funding over a 20year period to address issues such as combating the illegal cigarette trade and increasing the quality and quantity of locally grown tobacco 

in june 2012 we committed €15 million to interpol over a threeyear period to support the agencys global initiative to combat transborder crime involving illicit goods including tobacco products this initiative funds the coordination of information gathering training programs for law enforcement officials development of product authentication standards and public information campaigns 

Ÿ   reducedrisk products   we use the term reducedrisk products “rrps” to refer to products with the potential to reduce individual risk and population harm in comparison to smoking combustible cigarettes one of our strategic priorities is to develop assess and commercialize a portfolio of innovative rrps our rrps are in various stages of development and we are conducting extensive and rigorous scientific studies to determine whether we can support claims for such products of reduced exposure to harmful and potentially harmful constituents in smoke and ultimately claims of reduced disease risk when compared to smoking combustible cigarettes before making any such claims we will need to rigorously evaluate the full set of data from the relevant scientific studies to determine whether they substantiate reduced exposure or risk any such claims may also be subject to government review and approval as is the case in the us today we draw upon a team of worldclass scientists from a broad spectrum of scientific disciplines and our efforts are guided by the following three key objectives 

 

 

 

our product development is based on the elimination of combustion via tobacco heating and other innovative systems for aerosol generation which we believe is the most promising path to reduce risk 

our approach to individual risk assessment is to use cessation as the benchmark because the shortterm and longterm effects of smoking cessation are well known and the closer the clinical data derived from adult smokers who switch to an rrp resemble the data from those who quit the more confident one can be that the product reduces risk 

four rrp platforms are in various stages of development and commercialization readiness 

 

 

  39 

exploring two routes for this platform one with electronics and one without the product replicates the feel and ritual of smoking without tobacco and without burning we have begun preclinical testing of this product 

 

we are also developing other potential product platforms 

we are proceeding with the commercialization of rrps in january 2014 we announced an investment of up to €500 million in our first manufacturing facility in the european union and an associated pilot plant near bologna italy to produce our rrps we plan for the factory to initially manufacture platform 1 tobacco products  heatsticks when fully operational by 2016 and together with the pilot plant that was opened for production in october 2014 we expect to reach an annual production capacity of up to 30 billion units 

in the united states an established regulatory framework for assessing “modified risk tobacco products” “mrtps” exists under the jurisdiction of the food and drug administration “fda” we expect that future fda actions are likely to influence the regulatory approach of other interested governments our assessment approach and the studies conducted to date reflect the rigorous evidentiary standards set forth in the fda’s draft guidance for modified risk tobacco product applications 2012 we have shared our approach and studies with the fda’s center for tobacco products in parallel we are engaging with regulators in several eu member states as well as in a number of other countries we expect to submit a modified risk tobacco product application for platform 1 when we believe we have met the evidentiary standards set forth in the draft guidance 

as we work to develop evidence to substantiate the risk reduction potential of our products we will review our ability to make claims of reduced exposure or disease risk based on applicable laws and regulations and as we are already doing engage with regulators and share the evidence with them we are also engaging with the scientific community sharing our assessment approach and the results we have generated there can be no assurance that we will succeed in our efforts or that regulators will permit the marketing of our rrps with substantiated claims of reduced formation exposure individual risk or population harm 

we have commercialized the platform 1 electronic system under the iqos  brand name for use with specially made tobacco sticks under the marlboro and heatsticks  brands in november 2014 we introduced the iqos system in pilot city launches in nagoya japan and in milan italy and plan to expand nationally in those two countries in 2015 we plan to launch the product in several other markets thereafter the product is not being marketed with claims of reduced formation reduced exposure or disease risk pending the outcome of our scientific studies and where required governmental review and approval 

in december 2013 we established a strategic framework with altria group inc altria under which altria will make available its evapor products exclusively to us for commercialization outside the united states and we will make available two of our candidate reducedrisk tobacco products exclusively to altria for commercialization in the united states in march 2015 we will launch solaris a platform 4 evapor product in spain the agreements also provide for cooperation on the scientific assessment of and for the sharing of improvements to the existing generation of licensed products 

in june 2014 we acquired 100 of nicocigs limited a leading ukbased evapor company whose principal brand is nicolites  this acquisition provided pmi with immediate access to and a significant presence in the uk evapor market 

Ÿ   other legislation regulation or governmental action  in argentina the national commission for the defense of competition issued a resolution in may 2010 in which it found that our affiliates establishment in 1997 of a system of exclusive zonified distributors “ezds” in buenos aires city and region was anticompetitive despite having issued two prior decisions in 1997 and 2000 in which it had found the establishment of the ezd system was not anticompetitive the resolution is not a final decision and our argentinean affiliate has opposed the resolution and submitted additional evidence 

in germany in october 2013 the administrative district office munich acting under the policy supervision of the bavarian ministry of health and environment sent our german affiliate an order alleging that certain components of its marlboro  advertising campaign do not comply with the applicable tobacco advertising law which required our affiliate to stop this particular campaign throughout germany and remove all outdoor advertisements within one month from the effective date of the order and pointofsale materials within three months our affiliate does not believe the allegations properly reflect the facts and the law and filed a challenge in the munich administrative court against the order at a hearing held in april 2014 at the bavarian higher administrative court the parties agreed 

 40 

that our affiliate can continue the campaign with certain limitations on image visuals and text slogans for the duration of the court proceedings 

it is not possible to predict what if any additional legislation regulation or other governmental action will be enacted or implemented relating to the manufacturing advertising sale or use of tobacco products or the tobacco industry generally it is possible however that legislation regulation or other governmental action could be enacted or implemented that might materially affect our business volume results of operations cash flows and financial position 

governmental investigations 

from time to time we are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters as part of an investigation by the department of special investigations “dsi” of the government of thailand into alleged under declaration of import prices by thai cigarette importers the dsi proposed to bring charges against our subsidiary philip morris thailand limited thailand branch “pm thailand” for alleged underpayment of customs duties and excise taxes of approximately 2 billion covering the period from july 28 2003 to february 20 2007 “20032007 investigation” in september 2009 the dsi submitted the case file to the public prosecutor for review the dsi also commenced an informal inquiry alleging underpayment by pm thailand of customs duties and excise taxes of approximately 18 billion covering the period 20002003 in early 2011 the public prosecutors office issued a nonprosecution order in the 20032007 investigation in august 2011 the directorgeneral of dsi publicly announced that he disagreed with the nonprosecution order thus the matter was referred for resolution to the attorney general whose deputy subsequently stated that the attorney general has made a ruling to proceed with a prosecution order based on available information it is probable that criminal charges will be filed pm thailand has been cooperating with the thai authorities and believes that its declared import prices are in compliance with the customs valuation agreement of the wto and thai law 

additionally in november 2010 a wto panel issued its decision in a dispute relating to facts that arose from august 2006 between the philippines and thailand concerning a series of thai customs and tax measures affecting cigarettes imported by pm thailand into thailand from the philippines the wto panel decision which was upheld by the wto appellate body concluded that thailand had no basis to find that pm thailands declared customs values and taxes paid were too low as alleged by the dsi in 2009 the decision also created obligations for thailand to revise its laws regulations or practices affecting the customs valuation and tax treatment of future cigarette imports thailand agreed in september 2011 to comply with the decision by october 2012 the philippines contends that to date thailand has not fully complied and is pursuing bilateral discussions with thailand to address the outstanding issues at wto meetings the philippines has repeatedly expressed concerns with ongoing investigations by thailand of pm thailand noting that these investigations appear to be based on grounds not supported by wto customs valuation rules and inconsistent with several decisions already taken by thai customs and other thai governmental agencies

trade policy 

we are subject to various trade restrictions imposed by the united states and countries in which we do business “trade sanctions” including the trade and economic sanctions administered by the us department of the treasurys office of foreign assets control “ofac” and the us department of state it is our policy to fully comply with these trade sanctions 

tobacco products are agricultural products under us law and are not technological or strategic in nature from time to time we make sales in countries subject to trade sanctions pursuant to either exemptions or licenses granted under the applicable trade sanctions 

a subsidiary sells products to distributors that in turn sell those products to duty free customers that supply un peacekeeping forces around the world including those in the republic of the sudan we do not believe that these exempt sales of our products for ultimate resale in the republic of the sudan which are de minimis in volume and value present a material risk to our shareholders our reputation or the value of our shares we have no employees operations or assets in the republic of the sudan 

we do not sell products in cuba iran and syria 

to our knowledge none of our commercial arrangements result in the governments of any country identified by the us government as a state sponsor of terrorism nor entities controlled by those governments receiving cash or acting as intermediaries in violation of us laws 

certain states within the us have enacted legislation permitting state pension funds to divest or abstain from future investment in stocks

of companies that do business with certain countries that are sanctioned by the us we do not believe such legislation has had a material effect on the price of our shares

financial review 

Ÿ net cash provided by operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities of 77 billion  for the year ended december 31 2014  decreased  by 24 billion  from the comparable 2013  period the decrease  was due primarily to lower net earnings 12 billion primarily related to unfavorable currency movements an increase in our working capital requirements 708 million and higher cash payments related to exit costs 

the unfavorable movements in working capital were due primarily to the following 

 

on february 6 2014 we announced a oneyear gross productivity and cost savings target for 2014 of approximately 300 million during 2014 we exceeded this target 

on february 5 2015 we announced that our productivity and cost savings initiatives will include but are not limited to the continued enhancement of production processes the harmonization of tobacco blends the streamlining of product specifications and number of brand variants supply chain improvements and overall spending efficiency across the company we anticipate that these initiatives combined with savings associated with the manufacturing footprint restructuring implemented in 2014 notably in australia and the netherlands should result in a total company costbase increase excluding rrps and currency of approximately 1 

net cash provided by operating activities of 101 billion  for the year ended december 31 2013  increased by 714 million  from the comparable 2012  period the increase was due primarily to a decrease in our working capital requirements 451 million and lower pension contributions 57 million 

the favorable movements in working capital were due primarily to the following 

 

on february 7 2013 we announced a oneyear gross productivity and cost savings target for 2013 of approximately 300 million during 2013 we exceeded this target primarily through the rationalization of tobacco blends and product specifications and other manufacturing and procurement initiatives 

Ÿ net cash used in investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities of 996 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  decreased  by 17 billion  from the comparable 2013  period due primarily to less cash spent on investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries and higher cash collateral received from derivatives designated as net investment hedges partially offset primarily by the purchase of nicocigs limited 

net cash used in investing activities of 27 billion  for the year ended december 31 2013 increased  by 17 billion  from the comparable 2012  period due primarily to higher cash spent on investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries 14 billion and higher capital expenditures 144 million 

as previously discussed on september 30 2013 we acquired a 49 equity interest in united arab emiratesbased arab investorsta fzc for approximately 625 million on december 12 2013 we acquired from megapolis investment bv a 20 equity interest in megapolis distribution bv the holding company of cjsc tk megapolis our distributor in russia for a purchase price of 760 million for further details see item 8 note 4 investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries  to our consolidated financial statements

our capital expenditures were 12 billion  in 2014  12 billion in 2013  and 11 billion  in 2012  the 2014 expenditures were primarily related to investments in reducedrisk products productivityenhancing programs equipment for new products and the expansion of our capacity in indonesia for machinemade kretek cigarettes we expect total capital expenditures in 2015  of approximately 12 billion including additional capital expenditures related to our ongoing investment in reducedrisk products to be funded by operating cash flows 

Ÿ net cash used in financing activities 

during 2014  net cash used in financing activities was 68 billion  compared with net cash used in financing activities of 82 billion  during 2013  and 81 billion  in 2012  during 2014  we used a total of 132 billion to repurchase our common stock pay dividends and repay debt these uses were partially offset by proceeds from our debt offerings and shortterm borrowings in 2014  of 66 billion during 2013  we used a total of 171 billion to repurchase our common stock pay dividends repay debt and purchase subsidiary shares from noncontrolling interests these uses were partially offset by proceeds from our debt offerings and shortterm borrowings in 2013  of 92 billion during 2012  we used a total of 154 billion to repurchase our common stock pay dividends and repay debt these uses were partially offset by proceeds from our debt offerings and shortterm borrowings in 2012  of 76 billion 

  

in september 2013 grupo carso sold us its remaining 20 interest in our mexican tobacco business for 703 million as a result we own 100 of our mexican tobacco business for further details see item 8 note 6 acquisitions and other business arrangements  to our consolidated financial statements 

  

dividends paid in 2014  2013  and 2012  were 60 billion  57 billion  and 54 billion  respectively 

Ÿ debt and liquidity 

we define cash and cash equivalents as shortterm highly liquid investments readily convertible to known amounts of cash that mature within a maximum of three months and have an insignificant risk of change in value due to interest rate or credit risk changes as a policy we do not hold any investments in structured or equitylinked products our cash and cash equivalents are predominantly held in shortterm bank deposits with institutions having a longterm rating of a or better 

credit ratings  – the cost and terms of our financing arrangements as well as our access to commercial paper markets may be affected by applicable credit ratings at february 19 2015 our credit ratings and outlook by major credit rating agencies were as follows 



credit facilities  –   on january 23 2015 we entered into an agreement to extend the term of our existing 25 billion multiyear revolving credit facility effective february 28 2015 from february 28 2019 to february 28 2020 on january 23 2015 we also entered into an agreement to extend the term of our existing 20 billion 364day revolving credit facility effective february 10 2015 from february 10 2015 to february 9 2016 

 52 

at february 19 2015 our committed credit facilities were as follows 

    in billions 



     1 effective february 28 2015 our 25 billion multiyear revolving credit facility will be 

       extended from february 28 2019 to february 28 2020 

  

at february 19 2015 there were no borrowings under the committed credit facilities and the entire 80 billion of committed amounts were available for borrowing 

  

all banks participating in our committed credit facilities have an investmentgrade longterm credit rating from the credit rating agencies we continuously monitor the credit quality of our banking group and at this time we are not aware of any potential nonperforming credit provider 

each of these facilities requires us to maintain a ratio of consolidated earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “consolidated ebitda” to consolidated interest expense of not less than 35 to 10 on a rolling fourquarter basis at december 31 2014  our ratio calculated in accordance with the agreements was 122  to 10 these facilities do not include any credit rating triggers material adverse change clauses or any provisions that could require us to post collateral we expect to continue to meet our covenants the terms “consolidated ebitda” and “consolidated interest expense” both of which include certain adjustments are defined in the facility agreements previously filed with the us securities and exchange commission 

in addition to the committed credit facilities discussed above certain of our subsidiaries maintain shortterm credit arrangements to meet their respective working capital needs these credit arrangements which amounted to approximately 32 billion  at december 31 2014  and 24 billion  at december 31 2013  are for the sole use of our subsidiaries borrowings under these arrangements amounted to 12 billion  at december 31 2014  and 10 billion  at december 31 2013  

commercial paper program –  we have commercial paper programs in place in the us and in europe at december 31 2014  we had no commercial paper outstanding at december 31 2013 we had 14 billion of commercial paper outstanding 

effective april 19 2013 our commercial paper program in the us was increased by 20 billion as a result our commercial paper programs in place in the us and in europe currently have an aggregate issuance capacity of 80 billion 

we expect that the existence of the commercial paper program and the committed credit facilities coupled with our operating cash flows will enable us to meet our liquidity requirements 

debt  –  our total debt was 295 billion  at december 31 2014  and 277 billion  at december 31 2013  fixedrate debt constituted approximately 95 of our total debt at december 31 2014  and 90 of our total debt at december 31 2013  the weightedaverage allin financing cost of our total debt was 32 in 2014  compared to 35 in 2013  see item 8 note 16 fair value measurements  to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our disclosures related to the fair value of debt the amount of debt that we can issue is subject to approval by our board of directors 

on february 21 2014 we filed a shelf registration statement with the us securities and exchange commission under which we may from time to time sell debt securities andor warrants to purchase debt securities over a threeyear period

e  us dollar equivalents for foreign currency notes were calculated based on exchange rates on the date of issuance 

the net proceeds from the sale of the securities listed in the table above will be used for general corporate purposes 

the weightedaverage time to maturity of our longterm debt was 108 years at the end of 2013  and 2014  

 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements including special purpose entities other than guarantees and contractual obligations discussed below 

guarantees  –  at december 31 2014  we were contingently liable for 10 billion of guarantees of our own performance which were primarily related to excise taxes on the shipment of our products there is no liability in the consolidated financial statements associated with these guarantees at december 31 2014 our thirdparty guarantees were insignificant 

 54

7  other longterm liabilities consist primarily of postretirement health care costs and accruals established for employment costs the following longterm liabilities included on the consolidated balance sheet are excluded from the table above accrued pension and postemployment costs tax contingencies insurance accruals and other accruals we are unable to estimate the timing of payments or contributions in the case of accrued pension costs for these items currently we anticipate making pension contributions of approximately 144 million in 2015 based on current tax and benefit laws as discussed in item 8 note 13 benefit plans  to our consolidated financial statements 

the ec agreement payments discussed below are excluded from the table above as the payments are subject to adjustment based on certain variables including our market share in the eu 

ec agreement  –  as discussed in item 8 note 20 ec agreement  in 2004 we entered into an agreement with the european commission acting on behalf of the european community that provides for broad cooperation with european law enforcement agencies on anticontraband and anticounterfeit efforts this agreement has been signed by all 27 member states this agreement calls for payments that are to be adjusted based on certain variables including our market share in the european union in the year preceding payment because future additional payments are subject to these variables we record these payments as an expense in cost of sales when product is shipped in addition we are also responsible to pay the excise taxes vat and customs duties on qualifying product seizures of up to 90 million cigarettes and are subject to payments of five times the applicable taxes and duties if qualifying product seizures exceed 90 million cigarettes in a given year in october 2014 this agreement was amended and the threshold was increased to 450 million cigarettes in a given year this modification was effective as of july 2012 to date our annual payments related to product seizures have been immaterial total charges related to the ec agreement of 71 million  81 million  and 78 million  were recorded in cost of sales in 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively 

Ÿ equity and dividends

on may 1 2010 we began repurchasing shares under a threeyear 120 billion  share repurchase program that was authorized by our board of directors in february 2010 on july 31 2012  we completed this share repurchase program ahead of schedule in total we purchased 1791 million  shares for 120 billion  under this program 

on august 1 2012 we began repurchasing shares under a new threeyear 180 billion  share repurchase program that was authorized by our board of directors in june 2012 from august 1 2012 through december 31 2014  we repurchased 1446 million  shares of our common stock at a cost of 127 billion  under this repurchase program during 2014  we repurchased 452 million  shares at a cost of 38 billion

market risk 

Ÿ counterparty risk    we predominantly work with financial institutions with strong short and longterm credit ratings as assigned by standard  poor’s and moody’s these banks are also part of a defined group of relationship banks noninvestment grade institutions are only used in certain emerging markets to the extent required by local business needs we have a conservative approach when it comes to choosing financial counterparties and financial instruments as such we do not invest or hold investments in any structured or equitylinked products the majority of our cash and cash equivalents is currently invested in bank deposits maturing within less than 30 days 

we continuously monitor and assess the credit worthiness of all our counterparties 

Ÿ derivative financial instruments   we operate in markets outside of the us with manufacturing and sales facilities in various locations throughout the world consequently we use certain financial instruments to manage our foreign currency and interest rate exposure we use derivative financial instruments principally to reduce our exposure to market risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates by creating offsetting exposures we are not a party to leveraged derivatives and by policy do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 

see item 8 note 15 financial instruments  item 8 note 16 fair value measurements  and item 8 note 22 balance sheet offsetting  to our consolidated financial statements for further details on our derivative financial instruments and the related collateral arrangements 

Ÿ value at risk    we use a value at risk computation to estimate the potential oneday loss in the fair value of our interestratesensitive financial instruments and to estimate the potential oneday loss in pretax earnings of our foreign currency pricesensitive derivative financial instruments this computation includes our debt shortterm investments and foreign currency forwards swaps and options anticipated transactions foreign currency trade payables and receivables and net investments in foreign subsidiaries which the foregoing instruments are intended to hedge were excluded from the computation 

the computation estimates were made assuming normal market conditions using a 95 confidence interval we use a “variancecovariance” model to determine the observed interrelationships between movements in interest rates and various currencies these interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate and forward currency rate movements over the preceding quarter for determining value at risk at december 31 2014  and 2013  and over each of the four preceding quarters for the calculation of average 

 56 

value at risk amounts during each year the values of foreign currency options do not change on a onetoone basis with the underlying currency and were valued accordingly in the computation 

the estimated potential oneday loss in fair value of our interestratesensitive instruments primarily debt under normal market conditions and the estimated potential oneday loss in pretax earnings from foreign currency instruments under normal market conditions as calculated in the value at risk model were as follows 



the value at risk computation is a risk analysis tool designed to statistically estimate the maximum probable daily loss from adverse movements in interest and foreign currency rates under normal market conditions the computation does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value or earnings to be incurred by us nor does it consider the effect of favorable changes in market rates we cannot predict actual future movements in such market rates and do not present these results to be indicative of future movements in market rates or to be representative of any actual impact that future changes in market rates may have on our future results of operations or financial position 

contingencies 

see item 3 and item 8 note 21 contingencies  to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of contingencies 

cautionary factors that may affect future results 

forwardlooking and cautionary statements 

we may from time to time make written or oral forwardlooking statements including statements contained in filings with the sec in reports to stockholders and in press releases and investor webcasts you can identify these forwardlooking statements by use of words such as strategy expects continues plans anticipates believes will estimates intends projects goals targets and other words of similar meaning you can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts

separation from altria group inc 

  

we were a wholly owned subsidiary of altria group inc “altria” until the distribution of all of our shares owned by altria the “spinoff” was made on march 28 2008 the “distribution date” 

  

acquisitions and other business arrangements 

  

 we enhanced our business with the following transactions 

in the fourth quarter of 2013 as part of our initiative to enhance profitability and growth in north african and middle eastern markets we decided to restructure our business in egypt the new business model entails a new contract manufacturing agreement with our longstanding strategic business partner eastern company sae the creation of a new pmi affiliate in egypt and a new distribution agreement with trans business for trading and distribution llc to accomplish this restructuring and to ensure a smooth transition to the new model we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2013 a charge to our 2013 fullyear reported diluted eps of approximately 010 to reflect the discontinuation of existing contractual arrangements 

on december 20 2013 we established a strategic framework with altria under which altria will make available its ecigarette products exclusively to us for commercialization outside the united states and we will make available two of our candidate reducedrisk tobacco products exclusively to altria for commercialization in the united states the agreements also provide for cooperation on the scientific assessment of these products and for the sharing of improvements to the existing generation of reducedrisk products 

on december 12 2013 we acquired from megapolis investment bv a 20 equity interest in megapolis distribution bv the holding company of cjsc tk megapolis megapolis pmis distributor in russia the purchase price of 750 million excludes an additional payment of up to 100 million which is contingent on megapoliss operational performance over the four fiscal years following the closing of the transaction 

on september 30 2013 we acquired a 49 equity interest in united arab emiratesbased arab investorsta fzc aita for approximately 625 million as a result of this transaction we hold an approximate 25 economic interest in société des tabacs algéroemiratie staem an algerian joint venture which is 51 owned by aita and 49 by the algerian stateowned enterprise société nationale des tabacs et allumettes spa staem manufactures and distributes under license some of pmis brands 

 1  

in may 2013 we announced that grupo carso sab de cv grupo carso would sell to us its remaining 20 interest in our mexican tobacco business the sale was completed on september 30 2013 for 703 million as a result we now own 100 of our mexican tobacco business a director of pmi has an affiliation with grupo carso the final purchase price is subject to a potential adjustment based on the actual performance of the mexican tobacco business over the threeyear period ending two fiscal years after the closing of the purchase 

during 2012 we did not engage in any businesses development transactions

effective january 1 2011 we established a new business structure with vietnam national tobacco corporation “vinataba” in vietnam further developing our existing joint venture with vinataba through the licensing of marlboro  and establishing a pmicontrolled branch for the building of our brands 

  

source of funds — dividends 

  

we are a legal entity separate and distinct from our direct and indirect subsidiaries accordingly our right and thus the right of our creditors and stockholders to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of any subsidiary is subject to the prior rights of creditors of such subsidiary except to the extent that claims of our company itself as a creditor may be recognized as a holding company our principal sources of funds including funds to make payment on our debt securities are from the receipt of dividends and repayment of debt from our subsidiaries our principal wholly owned and majorityowned subsidiaries currently are not limited by longterm debt or other agreements in their ability to pay cash dividends or to make other distributions with respect to their common stock 

b financial information about segments 

  

we divide our markets into four geographic regions which constitute our segments for financial reporting purposes 

  

 

net revenues and operating companies income    together with a reconciliation to operating income attributable to each such segment for each of the last three years are set forth in note 12 segment reporting  to our consolidated financial statements which is incorporated herein by reference to the 2013  annual report see part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for a discussion of our operating results by business segment 

  

 2  

the relative percentages of operating companies income attributable to each reportable segment were as follows 

  



 

 

we use the term net revenues to refer to our operating revenues from the sale of our products net of sales and promotion incentives our net revenues and operating income are affected by various factors including the volume of products we sell the price of our products changes in currency exchange rates and the mix of products we sell mix is a term used to refer to the proportionate value of premiumprice brands to midprice or lowprice brands in any given market product mix mix can also refer to the proportion of shipment volume in more profitable markets versus shipment volume in less profitable markets geographic mix we often collect excise taxes from our customers and then remit them to local governments and in those circumstances we include excise taxes in our net revenues and excise taxes on products our cost of sales consists principally of tobacco leaf nontobacco raw materials labor and manufacturing costs 

  

our marketing administration and research costs include the costs of marketing and selling our products other costs generally not related to the manufacture of our products including general corporate expenses and costs incurred to develop new products the most significant components of our marketing administration and research costs are marketing and sales expenses and general and administrative expenses 

  

c narrative description of business 

  

our subsidiaries and affiliates and their licensees manufacture market and sell tobacco products outside the united states of america 

  

our total cigarette shipments decreased 51  in 2013  to 8802 billion  units we estimate that international cigarette market shipments were approximately 56 trillion units in 2013  a 14 decrease over 2012  we estimate that our reported share of the international cigarette market which is defined as worldwide cigarette volume excluding the united states of america was approximately 157 in 2013  163 in 2012  and 162 in 2011  excluding the people’s republic of china “prc” we estimate that our reported share of the international cigarette market was approximately 282 288 and 283 in 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively 

  

shipments of our principal cigarette brand marlboro  decreased 35  in 2013  and represented approximately 92 of the international cigarette market excluding the prc in 2013  94 in 2012  and 93 in 2011  

  

we have a cigarette market share of at least 15 and in a number of instances substantially more than 15 in 100 markets including algeria argentina australia austria belgium brazil canada colombia the czech republic egypt finland france germany greece hungary indonesia italy japan kazakhstan korea mexico the netherlands the philippines poland portugal romania russia saudi arabia serbia singapore spain sweden switzerland thailand turkey and ukraine 

  

references to total international cigarette market total cigarette market total market and market shares in this form 10k reflect our best estimates based on a number of internal and external sources

consumer focused marketing  sales 

  

in 2012 we launched a new strategic framework that combines our marketing and sales expertise with our indepth knowledge of various sales territories this framework allows us not only to engage more effectively with our adult consumers but also to enhance the success of our direct and indirect trade partners the main benefits are 

  

 

the four main types of distribution that we use globally often simultaneously in a given market are 

  

   

in many markets we also directly supply key accounts including gas stations retail chains and supermarkets 

  

our distribution and sales systems are supported by sales forces that total approximately 19900 employees worldwide our sales forces are well trained and recognized by trade surveys for their professionalism 

our products are marketed and promoted through various media and channels including where permitted by law point of sale communications brand events accessrestricted web sites print and direct communication to verified adult smokers our direct communication with verified adult smokers utilizes mail email and other electronic communication tools promotional activities include where permitted by law competitions invitations to events interactive programs consumer premiums and price promotions to support advertising and promotional activities in the markets we have a dedicated consumer engagement group that develops innovative engagement tools for adult consumers based on the latest technologies and adult consumer trends 

  

competition 

  

we are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business we compete primarily on the basis of product quality brand recognition brand loyalty taste innovation packaging service marketing advertising and retail price our competitors include three large international tobacco companies and several regional and local tobacco companies and in some instances stateowned tobacco enterprises principally in algeria egypt the prc taiwan thailand and vietnam industry consolidation and privatizations of stateowned enterprises have led to an overall increase in competitive pressures some competitors have different profit and volume objectives and some international competitors are susceptible to changes in different currency exchange rates we compete predominantly with american blend cigarette brands such as marlboro  lm parliament  and chesterfield  which are the most popular across many of our markets we seek to compete in all profitable retail price categories although our brand portfolio is weighted towards the premiumprice category 

  

procurement and raw materials 

  

we purchase tobacco leaf of various types grades and styles throughout the world the majority through independent tobacco suppliers we also contract directly with farmers in several countries including argentina brazil colombia the dominican republic ecuador italy kazakhstan mexico pakistan the philippines poland and the united states direct sourcing from farmers represents approximately 30 of pmi’s global leaf requirements the largest supplies of tobacco leaf are sourced from brazil the united states indonesia mostly for domestic use in kretek products turkey greece argentina mozambique and malawi 

we believe that there is an adequate supply of tobacco leaf in the world markets to satisfy our current and anticipated production requirements 

  

 4  

in addition to tobacco leaf we purchase a wide variety of direct materials from a total of approximately 450 suppliers our top ten suppliers of direct materials combined represent approximately 57 of our total direct materials purchases the three most significant direct materials that we purchase are printed paper board used in packaging acetate tow used in filter making and fine paper used in cigarette manufacturing in addition the adequate supply and procurement of cloves are of particular importance to our indonesian business

 7  

risks related to our business and industry 

cigarettes are subject to substantial taxes significant increases in cigaretterelated taxes have been proposed or enacted and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted in numerous jurisdictions these tax increases may disproportionately affect our profitability and make us less competitive versus certain of our competitors 

tax regimes including excise taxes sales taxes and import duties can disproportionately affect the retail price of manufactured cigarettes versus other tobacco products or disproportionately affect the relative retail price of our manufactured cigarette brands versus cigarette brands manufactured by certain of our competitors because our portfolio is weighted toward the premiumprice manufactured cigarette category tax regimes based on sales price can place us at a competitive disadvantage in certain markets as a result our volume and profitability may be adversely affected in these markets 

increases in cigarette taxes are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on our sales of cigarettes due to resulting lower consumption levels a shift in sales from manufactured cigarettes to other tobacco products and from the premiumprice to the midprice or lowprice cigarette categories where we may be underrepresented from local sales to legal crossborder purchases of lower price products or to illicit products such as contraband counterfeit and illicit whites 

our business faces significant governmental action aimed at increasing regulatory requirements with the goal of reducing or preventing the use of tobacco products 

governmental actions combined with the diminishing social acceptance of smoking and private actions to restrict smoking have resulted in reduced industry volume in many of our markets and we expect that such factors will continue to reduce consumption levels and will increase downtrading and the risk of counterfeiting contraband illicit whites and crossborder purchases significant regulatory developments will take place over the next few years in most of our markets driven principally by the world health organizations framework convention on tobacco control “fctc” the fctc is the first international public health treaty on tobacco and its objective is to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation the fctc has led to increased efforts by tobacco control advocates and public health organizations to reduce the palatability and attractiveness of tobacco products to adult smokers regulatory initiatives that have been proposed introduced or enacted include 

  

 our operating income could be significantly affected by regulatory initiatives resulting in a significant decrease in demand for our brands in particular requirements that lead to a commoditization of tobacco products as well as any significant increase in the cost of complying with new regulatory requirements 

 8  

litigation related to tobacco use and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke “ets” could substantially reduce our profitability and could severely impair our liquidity 

there is litigation related to tobacco products pending in certain jurisdictions damages claimed in some tobaccorelated litigation are significant and in certain cases in brazil canada israel and nigeria range into the billions of us dollars we anticipate that new cases will continue to be filed the fctc encourages litigation against tobacco product manufacturers it is possible that our consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation see item 3 legal proceedings  of this form 10k 

we face intense competition and our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations 

we compete primarily on the basis of product quality brand recognition brand loyalty taste innovation packaging service marketing advertising and price we are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business the competitive environment and our competitive position can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions erosion of consumer confidence competitors introduction of lowerprice products or innovative products higher tobacco product taxes higher absolute prices and larger gaps between retail price categories and product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate tobacco products competitors include three large international tobacco companies and several regional and local tobacco companies and in some instances stateowned tobacco enterprises principally in algeria china egypt taiwan thailand and vietnam industry consolidation and privatizations of stateowned enterprises have led to an overall increase in competitive pressures some competitors have different profit and volume objectives and some international competitors are susceptible to changes in different currency exchange rates 

because we have operations in numerous countries our results may be influenced by economic regulatory and political developments or natural disasters in many countries 

some of the countries in which we operate face the threat of civil unrest and can be subject to regime changes in others nationalization terrorism conflict and the threat of war may have a significant impact on the business environment economic political regulatory or other developments or natural disasters could disrupt our supply chain manufacturing capabilities or our distribution capabilities in addition such developments could lead to loss of property or equipment that are critical to our business in certain markets and difficulty in staffing and managing our operations which could reduce our volumes revenues and net earnings in certain markets we are dependent on governmental approvals of various actions such as price changes 

in addition despite our high ethical standards and rigorous control and compliance procedures aimed at preventing and detecting unlawful conduct given the breadth and scope of our international operations we may not be able to detect all potential improper or unlawful conduct by our employees and international partners 

we may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences or to respond to consumer behavior influenced by economic downturns 

our tobacco business is subject to changes in consumer preferences which may be influenced by local economic conditions to be successful we must 

  

 in periods of economic uncertainty consumers may tend to purchase lowerprice brands and the volume of our premiumprice and midprice brands and our profitability could suffer accordingly such downtrading trends may be reinforced by regulation that limits branding communication and product differentiation 

 9  

we lose revenues as a result of counterfeiting contraband crossborder purchases and nontax paid volume by local manufacturers 

large quantities of counterfeit cigarettes are sold in the international market we believe that marlboro  is the most heavily counterfeited international cigarette brand although we cannot quantify the revenues we lose as a result of this activity in addition our revenues are reduced by contraband legal crossborder purchases and nontax paid volume by local manufacturers 

from time to time we are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters 

investigations include allegations of contraband shipments of cigarettes allegations of unlawful pricing activities within certain markets allegations of underpayment of customs duties andor excise taxes allegations of false and misleading usage of descriptors and allegations of unlawful advertising we cannot predict the outcome of those investigations or whether additional investigations may be commenced and it is possible that our business could be materially affected by an unfavorable outcome of pending or future investigations see “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsoperating results by business segmentbusiness environmentgovernmental investigations” for a description of certain governmental investigations to which we are subject 

we may be unsuccessful in our attempts to produce products with the potential to reduce the risk of smokingrelated diseases compared to cigarettes 

we continue to seek ways to develop commercially viable new product technologies that may reduce the risk of smokingrelated diseases in comparison to cigarettes our goal is to develop products whose potential for exposure risk and harm reduction can be substantiated and provide adult smokers the taste sensory experience nicotine delivery profile and ritual characteristics that are similar to those currently provided by cigarettes we may not succeed in these efforts if we do not succeed but others do we may be at a competitive disadvantage furthermore we cannot predict whether regulators will permit the marketing of tobacco products with claims of reduced exposure risk or harm which could significantly undermine the commercial viability of these products 

our reported results could be adversely affected by unfavorable currency exchange rates and currency devaluations could impair our competitiveness 

we conduct our business primarily in local currency and for purposes of financial reporting the local currency results are translated into us dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period during times of a strengthening us dollar our reported net revenues and operating income will be reduced because the local currency translates into fewer us dollars during periods of local economic crises foreign currencies may be devalued significantly against the us dollar reducing our margins actions to recover margins may result in lower volume and a weaker competitive position 

the repatriation of our foreign earnings changes in the earnings mix and changes in us tax laws may increase our effective tax rate our ability to receive payments from foreign subsidiaries or to repatriate royalties and dividends could be restricted by local country currency exchange controls 

because we are a us holding company our most significant source of funds is distributions from our nonus subsidiaries under current us tax law in general we do not pay us taxes on our foreign earnings until they are repatriated to the us as distributions from our nonus subsidiaries these distributions may result in a residual us tax cost it may be advantageous to us in certain circumstances to significantly increase the amount of such distributions which could result in a material increase in our overall effective tax rate additionally the obama administration has indicated that it favors changes in us tax law that would fundamentally change how our earnings are taxed in the us if enacted and depending upon its precise terms such legislation could increase our overall effective tax rate certain countries in which we operate have adopted or could institute currency exchange controls that limit or prohibit our local subsidiaries ability to make payments outside the country 

our ability to grow may be limited by our inability to introduce new products enter new markets or to improve our margins through higher pricing and improvements in our brand and geographic mix 

our profitability may suffer if we are unable to introduce new products or enter new markets successfully to raise prices or maintain an acceptable proportion of our sales of higher margin products and sales in higher margin geographies 

 10  

we may be unable to expand our brand portfolio through successful acquisitions or the development of strategic business relationships 

one element of our growth strategy is to strengthen our brand portfolio and market positions through selective acquisitions and the development of strategic business relationships acquisition and strategic business development opportunities are limited and present risks of failing to achieve efficient and effective integration strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings there is no assurance that we will be able to acquire attractive businesses on favorable terms or that future acquisitions or strategic business developments will be accretive to earnings 

government mandated prices production control programs shifts in crops driven by economic conditions and the impact of climate change may increase the cost or reduce the quality of the tobacco and other agricultural products used to manufacture our products 

as with other agricultural commodities the price of tobacco leaf and cloves can be influenced by imbalances in supply and demand and crop quality can be influenced by variations in weather patterns including those caused by climate change tobacco production in certain countries is subject to a variety of controls including government mandated prices and production control programs changes in the patterns of demand for agricultural products could cause farmers to plant less tobacco any significant change in tobacco leaf and clove prices quality and quantity could affect our profitability and our business 

our ability to implement our strategy of attracting and retaining the best global talent may be impaired by the decreasing social acceptance of cigarette smoking 

the tobacco industry competes for talent with consumer products and other companies that enjoy greater societal acceptance as a result we may be unable to attract and retain the best global talent 

the failure of our information systems to function as intended or their penetration by outside parties with the intent to corrupt them could result in business disruption loss of revenue assets or personal or other sensitive data 

we use information systems to help manage business processes collect and interpret business data and communicate internally and externally with employees suppliers customers and others some of these information systems are managed by thirdparty service providers we have backup systems and business continuity plans in place and we take care to protect our systems and data from unauthorized access nevertheless failure of our systems to function as intended or penetration of our systems by outside parties intent on extracting or corrupting information or otherwise disrupting business processes could result in loss of revenue assets or personal or other sensitive data cause damage to our reputation and that of our brands and result in significant remediation and other costs to us 

we may be required to replace thirdparty contract manufacturers or service providers with our own resources 

in certain instances we contract with third parties to manufacture some of our products or product parts or to provide other services we may be unable to renew these agreements on satisfactory terms for numerous reasons including government regulations accordingly our costs may increase significantly if we must replace such third parties with our own resources

tobaccorelated litigation 

  

legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened against us andor our subsidiaries andor our indemnitees in various jurisdictions our indemnitees include distributors licensees and others that have been named as parties in certain cases and that we have agreed to defend as well as to pay costs and some or all of judgments if any that may be entered against them pursuant to the terms of the distribution agreement between altria and pmi pmi will indemnify altria and pm usa for tobacco product claims based in substantial part on products manufactured by pmi or contract manufactured for pmi by pm usa and pm usa will indemnify pmi for tobacco product claims based in substantial part on products manufactured by pm usa excluding tobacco products contract manufactured for pmi 

it is possible that there could be adverse developments in pending cases against us and our subsidiaries an unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobaccorelated litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation 

damages claimed in some of the tobaccorelated litigation are significant and in certain cases in brazil canada israel and nigeria range into the billions of us dollars the variability in pleadings in multiple jurisdictions together with the actual experience of management in litigating claims demonstrate that the monetary relief that may be specified in a lawsuit bears little relevance to the ultimate outcome much of the tobaccorelated litigation is in its early stages and litigation is subject to uncertainty however as discussed below we have to date been largely successful in defending tobaccorelated litigation 

we and our subsidiaries record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated at the present time while it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur after assessing the information available to it i management has not concluded that it is probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending tobaccorelated cases ii management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss for any of the pending tobaccorelated cases and iii accordingly no estimated loss has been accrued in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes in these cases if any legal defense costs are expensed as incurred 

 12  

it is possible that our consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation nevertheless although litigation is subject to uncertainty we and each of our subsidiaries named as a defendant believe and each has been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases that we have valid defenses to the litigation pending against us as well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts if any all such cases are and will continue to be vigorously defended however we and our subsidiaries may enter into settlement discussions in particular cases if we believe it is in our best interests to do so 

to date we have paid only one judgment in a tobacco related case that judgment including costs was approximately €1400 approximately 1900 and that payment was made in order to appeal an italian small claims case which was subsequently reversed on appeal to date no tobaccorelated case has been finally resolved in favor of a plaintiff against us our subsidiaries or indemnitees 

the table below lists the number of tobaccorelated cases pending against us andor our subsidiaries or indemnitees as of february 15 2014 december 31 2012  and december 31 2011  

  



since 1995 when the first tobaccorelated litigation was filed against a pmi entity 418 smoking and health lights health care cost recovery and public civil actions in which we andor one of our subsidiaries andor indemnitees were a defendant have been terminated in our favor ten cases have had decisions in favor of plaintiffs eight of these cases have subsequently reached final resolution in our favor and two remain on appeal

a general development of business 

  

general 

  

philip morris international inc is a virginia holding company incorporated in 1987 our subsidiaries and affiliates and their licensees are engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes and other tobacco products in markets outside of the united states of america our products are sold in more than 180 markets and in many of these markets they hold the number one or number two market share position we have a wide range of premium midprice and lowprice brands our portfolio comprises both international and local brands 

  

our portfolio of international and local brands is led by marlboro  the world’s best selling international cigarette which accounted for approximately 33  of our total 2012 shipment volume marlboro  is complemented in the premiumprice category by merit  parliament  and virginia slims  our leading midprice brands are lm  and chesterfield  other leading international brands include bond street  lark  muratti  next  philip morris  and red  white  

  

we also own a number of important local cigarette brands such as sampoerna  dji sam soe  and u mild  in indonesia fortune  champion  and hope  in the philippines diana  in italy optima  and apollosoyuz  in russia morven gold  in pakistan boston  in colombia belmont canadian classics  and number 7  in canada best  and classic  in serbia f6  in germany delicados  in mexico assos  in greece and petra  in the czech republic and slovakia while there are a number of markets where local brands remain important international brands are expanding their share in numerous markets with international brands contributing approximately 70  of our shipment volume in 2012 we are wellpositioned to continue to benefit from this trend 

  

separation from altria group inc 

  

we were a wholly owned subsidiary of altria group inc “altria” until the distribution of all of our shares owned by altria the “spinoff” was made on march 28 2008 the “distribution date” 

  

acquisitions and other business arrangements 

  

during 2012  we did not acquire any businesses during 2011  and 2010  we expanded our business with the following transactions 

  

2011  

  

in june 2011 we completed the acquisition of a cigarette business in jordan consisting primarily of cigarette manufacturing assets and inventories for 42 million  in january 2011 we acquired a cigar business consisting primarily of trademarks in the australian and new zealand markets for 20 million  

  

effective january 1 2011 we established a new business structure with vietnam national tobacco corporation “vinataba” in vietnam further developing our existing joint venture with vinataba through the licensing of marlboro  and establishing a pmicontrolled branch for the building of our brands 

2010  

  

in february 2010 our affiliate philip morris philippines manufacturing inc “pmpmi” and fortune tobacco corporation “ftc” combined their respective business activities by transferring selected assets and liabilities of pmpmi and ftc to a new company called pmftc inc “pmftc” pmpmi and ftc hold equal economic interests in pmftc while we manage the daytoday operations of pmftc and have a majority of its board of directors the establishment of pmftc permits both parties to benefit from their complementary brand portfolios as well as cost synergies from the resulting integration of manufacturing distribution and procurement and the further development and advancement of tobacco growing in the philippines 

  

in june 2010 we announced that our affiliate philip morris brasil industria e comercio ltda “pmb” would begin directly sourcing tobacco leaf from approximately 17000  tobacco farmers in southern brazil this initiative has enhanced pmi’s direct involvement in the supply chain and provides approximately 10  of pmi’s global leaf requirements the vertically integrated structure was made possible following separate agreements with two leaf suppliers in brazil alliance one brasil exportadora de tabacos ltda “aob” and universal leaf tabacos ltda “ult” 

 1  

these agreements resulted in aob and ult assigning approximately 9000  and 8000  contracts with tobacco farmers to pmb respectively as a result pmb offered employment to more than 200 employees most of them agronomy specialists and acquired related assets in southern brazil the purchase price for the net assets and the contractual relationships was 83 million  

  

  

source of funds — dividends 

  

we are a legal entity separate and distinct from our direct and indirect subsidiaries accordingly our right and thus the right of our creditors and stockholders to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of any subsidiary is subject to the prior rights of creditors of such subsidiary except to the extent that claims of our company itself as a creditor may be recognized as a holding company our principal sources of funds including funds to make payment on our debt securities are from the receipt of dividends and repayment of debt from our subsidiaries our principal wholly owned and majorityowned subsidiaries currently are not limited by longterm debt or other agreements in their ability to pay cash dividends or to make other distributions with respect to their common stock 

b financial information about segments 

  

we divide our markets into four geographic regions which constitute our segments for financial reporting purposes 

  

 

net revenues and operating companies income    together with a reconciliation to operating income attributable to each such segment for each of the last three years are set forth in note 12 segment reporting  to our consolidated financial statements which is incorporated herein by reference to the 2012  annual report see part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for a discussion of our operating results by business segment 

  

the relative percentages of operating companies income attributable to each reportable segment were as follows 

  



 

 

we use the term net revenues to refer to our operating revenues from the sale of our products net of sales and promotion incentives our net revenues and operating income are affected by various factors including the volume of products we sell the price of our products changes in currency exchange rates and the mix of products we sell 

 2  

mix is a term used to refer to the proportionate value of premiumprice brands to midprice or lowprice brands in any given market product mix mix can also refer to the proportion of shipment volume in more profitable markets versus shipment volume in less profitable markets geographic mix we often collect excise taxes from our customers and then remit them to local governments and in those circumstances we include excise taxes in our net revenues and excise taxes on products our cost of sales consists principally of tobacco leaf nontobacco raw materials labor and manufacturing costs 

  

our marketing administration and research costs include the costs of marketing and selling our products other costs generally not related to the manufacture of our products including general corporate expenses and costs incurred to develop new products the most significant components of our marketing administration and research costs are marketing and sales expenses and general and administrative expenses 

  

c narrative description of business 

  

our subsidiaries and affiliates and their licensees manufacture market and sell tobacco products outside the united states 

  

our total cigarette shipments increased 13  in 2012  to 9270 billion  units we estimate that international cigarette market shipments were approximately 57 trillion units in 2012  a 07 increase over 2011  we estimate that our reported share of the international cigarette market which is defined as worldwide cigarette volume excluding the united states was approximately 163 in 2012  162 in 2011  and 161 in 2010  excluding the people’s republic of china “prc” we estimate that our reported share of the international cigarette market was approximately 288 283 and 276 in 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively 

  

shipments of our principal cigarette brand marlboro  increased 05  in 2012  and represented approximately 93 of the international cigarette market excluding the prc in 2012  92 in 2011  and 91 in 2010  

  

we have a cigarette market share of at least 15 and in a number of instances substantially more than 15 in 98 markets including algeria argentina australia austria belgium canada colombia the czech republic egypt finland france germany greece hungary indonesia italy japan kazakhstan korea mexico the netherlands the philippines poland portugal romania russia saudi arabia serbia singapore spain sweden switzerland thailand turkey and ukraine 

  

references to total international cigarette market total cigarette market total market and market shares in this form 10k reflect our best estimates based on a number of internal and external sources 

consumer focused marketing  sales 

  

in 2012 we launched a new strategic framework that combines our marketing and sales expertise with our indepth knowledge of various sales territories this framework allows us not only to engage more effectively with our adult consumers but also to enhance the success of our direct and indirect trade partners the main benefits are 

  

 

the four main types of distribution that we use globally often simultaneously in a given market are 

  

   

in many markets we also directly supply key accounts including gas stations retail chains and supermarkets 

  

our distribution and sales systems are supported by sales forces that total approximately 18100 employees worldwide our sales forces are well trained and recognized by trade surveys for their professionalism 

 3  

our products are marketed and promoted through various media and channels including where permitted by law point of sale communications brand events accessrestricted web sites print and direct communication to verified adult smokers our direct communication with verified adult smokers utilizes mail email and other electronic communication tools promotional activities include where permitted by law competitions invitations to events interactive programs consumer premiums and price promotions to support advertising and promotional activities in the markets we have a dedicated consumer engagement group that develops innovative engagement tools for adult consumers based on the latest technologies and adult consumer trends 

  

competition 

  

we are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business we compete primarily on the basis of product quality brand recognition brand loyalty taste innovation packaging service marketing advertising and retail price our competitors include three large international tobacco companies and several regional and local tobacco companies and in some instances stateowned tobacco enterprises principally in algeria egypt the prc taiwan thailand and vietnam industry consolidation and privatizations of stateowned enterprises have led to an overall increase in competitive pressures some competitors have different profit and volume objectives and some international competitors are susceptible to changes in different currency exchange rates we compete predominantly with american blend cigarette brands such as marlboro  lm  and chesterfield  which are the most popular across many of our markets we seek to compete in all profitable retail price categories although our brand portfolio is weighted towards the premiumprice category 

  

procurement and raw materials 

  

we purchase tobacco leaf of various grades and styles throughout the world the majority through independent tobacco suppliers we also contract directly with farmers in several countries including argentina brazil colombia the dominican republic ecuador italy kazakhstan mexico pakistan the philippines poland and the united states 

  

as discussed above in june 2010 we announced that our affiliate pmb began directly sourcing tobacco leaf from tobacco farmers in southern brazil this initiative expanded pmi’s direct involvement in the supply chain and provides approximately 10 of pmi’s global leaf requirements 

  

our largest sources of supply are 

  

 

we believe that there is an adequate supply of tobacco in the world markets to satisfy our current and anticipated production requirements 

  

in addition to tobacco leaf we purchase a wide variety of direct materials from a total of approximately 430 suppliers our top ten suppliers of direct materials combined represent approximately 55 of our total direct materials purchases the three most significant direct materials that we purchase are printed paper board used in packaging acetate tow used in filter making and fine paper used in cigarette manufacturing in addition the adequate supply and procurement of cloves are of particular importance to our indonesian business

the disclosure regarding executive officers is set forth under the heading “executive officers as of february 22 2013” in item 10 of part iii of this form 10k and is incorporated herein by reference 

  

research and development 

  

one of our strategic priorities is to develop assess and commercialize a portfolio of innovative products with the potential to reduce the risk of smokingrelated diseases in comparison to conventional cigarettes we refer to these as next generation products or ngps pmi draws upon a team of worldclass scientists from a broad spectrum of scientific disciplines whose efforts are guided by the following key objectives 

 

 

 

we believe the elimination of combustion via tobacco heating and other innovative systems for aerosol generation is the most promising path to reduce risk and accordingly the ngps we are developing are based on platforms that do not involve combustion these platforms are in various stages of development one platform is in the early stages of clinical trials and industrial scaleup another is in its final development phase and the third requires at least one year for further product development we are also developing other potential platforms 

our approach to individual risk assessment is to use cessation as the benchmark because the shortterm and longterm effects of smoking cessation are well known and the closer the clinical data derived from adult smokers who switch to an ngp resemble the data from those who quit the more confident one can be that the product reduces the risk 

we also conduct research to support and reinforce our conventional product business we seek to be at the forefront of innovation significant investments have been made in new product development efforts for conventional products resulting in a wide range of product enhancements and the launch of innovative new products further with the increase in product regulations support for the conventional cigarette business has expanded and is expected to become more complex requiring additional capacity for analysis and testing in compliance with applicable laws and regulations 

  

finally working through biotechnology partners we are conducting research and development on technology platforms that can potentially lead to the development of alternative uses of tobacco 

 5  

the research and development expense for the years ended december 31 2012  2011  and 2010  is set forth in note 14 additional information  to our consolidated financial statements which is incorporated herein by reference to the 2012  annual report

 7  

risks related to our business and industry 

cigarettes are subject to substantial taxes significant increases in cigaretterelated taxes have been proposed or enacted and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted in numerous jurisdictions these tax increases may disproportionately affect our profitability and make us less competitive versus certain of our competitors 

tax regimes including excise taxes sales taxes and import duties can disproportionately affect the retail price of manufactured cigarettes versus other tobacco products or disproportionately affect the relative retail price of our manufactured cigarette brands versus cigarette brands manufactured by certain of our competitors because our portfolio is weighted toward the premiumprice manufactured cigarette category tax regimes based on sales price can place us at a competitive disadvantage in certain markets as a result our volume and profitability may be adversely affected in these markets 

increases in cigarette taxes are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on our sales of cigarettes due to resulting lower consumption levels a shift in sales from manufactured cigarettes to other tobacco products and from the premiumprice to the midprice or lowprice cigarette categories where we may be underrepresented from local sales to legal crossborder purchases of lower price products or to illicit products such as contraband counterfeit and illicit whites 

our business faces significant governmental action aimed at increasing regulatory requirements with the goal of reducing or preventing the use of tobacco products 

governmental actions combined with the diminishing social acceptance of smoking and private actions to restrict smoking have resulted in reduced industry volume in many of our markets and we expect that such factors will continue to reduce consumption levels and will increase downtrading and the risk of counterfeiting contraband and crossborder purchases significant regulatory developments will take place over the next few years in most of our markets driven principally by the world health organizations framework convention on tobacco control “fctc” the fctc is the first international public health treaty on tobacco and its objective is to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation the fctc has led to increased efforts by tobacco control advocates and public health organizations to reduce the palatability and attractiveness of tobacco products to adult smokers regulatory initiatives that have been proposed introduced or enacted include 

 our operating income could be significantly affected by regulatory initiatives resulting in a significant decrease in demand for our brands in particular requirements that lead to a commoditization of tobacco products as well as any significant increase in the cost of complying with new regulatory requirements 

litigation related to tobacco use and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke “ets” could substantially reduce our profitability and could severely impair our liquidity 

there is litigation related to tobacco products pending in certain jurisdictions damages claimed in some tobaccorelated litigation are significant and in certain cases in brazil canada israel and nigeria range into the billions of 

 8  

us dollars we anticipate that new cases will continue to be filed the fctc encourages litigation against tobacco product manufacturers it is possible that our consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation see item 3 legal proceedings  of this form 10k 

we face intense competition and our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations 

we compete primarily on the basis of product quality brand recognition brand loyalty taste innovation packaging service marketing advertising and price we are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business the competitive environment and our competitive position can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions erosion of consumer confidence competitors introduction of lowerprice products or innovative products higher tobacco product taxes higher absolute prices and larger gaps between retail price categories and product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate tobacco products competitors include three large international tobacco companies and several regional and local tobacco companies and in some instances stateowned tobacco enterprises principally in algeria china egypt taiwan thailand and vietnam industry consolidation and privatizations of stateowned enterprises have led to an overall increase in competitive pressures some competitors have different profit and volume objectives and some international competitors are susceptible to changes in different currency exchange rates 

because we have operations in numerous countries our results may be influenced by economic regulatory and political developments or natural disasters in many countries 

some of the countries in which we operate face the threat of civil unrest and can be subject to regime changes in others nationalization terrorism conflict and the threat of war may have a significant impact on the business environment economic political regulatory or other developments or natural disasters could disrupt our supply chain manufacturing capabilities or our distribution capabilities in addition such developments could lead to loss of property or equipment that are critical to our business in certain markets and difficulty in staffing and managing our operations which could reduce our volumes revenues and net earnings in certain markets we are dependent on governmental approvals of various actions such as price changes 

in addition despite our high ethical standards and rigorous control and compliance procedures aimed at preventing and detecting unlawful conduct given the breadth and scope of our international operations we may not be able to detect all potential improper or unlawful conduct by our employees and international partners 

we may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences or to respond to consumer behavior influenced by economic downturns 

our tobacco business is subject to changes in consumer preferences which may be influenced by local economic conditions to be successful we must 

 in periods of economic uncertainty consumers may tend to purchase lowerprice brands and the volume of our premiumprice and midprice brands and our profitability could suffer accordingly such downtrading trends may be reinforced by regulation that limits branding communication and product differentiation 

we lose revenues as a result of counterfeiting contraband and crossborder purchases 

large quantities of counterfeit cigarettes are sold in the international market we believe that marlboro  is the most heavily counterfeited international cigarette brand although we cannot quantify the revenues we lose as a result of this activity in addition our revenues are reduced by contraband and legal crossborder purchases 

from time to time we are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters 

investigations include allegations of contraband shipments of cigarettes allegations of unlawful pricing activities within certain markets allegations of underpayment of customs duties andor excise taxes allegations of false and misleading usage of descriptors such as “lights” and “ultra lights” and allegations of unlawful advertising we cannot predict the outcome of those investigations or whether additional investigations may be commenced and it is possible that our business could be materially affected by an unfavorable outcome of pending or future investigations see 

 9  

“managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsoperating results by business segmentbusiness environmentgovernmental investigations” for a description of governmental investigations to which we are subject 

we may be unsuccessful in our attempts to produce products with the potential to reduce the risk of smokingrelated diseases compared to conventional cigarettes 

we continue to seek ways to develop commercially viable new product technologies that may reduce the risk of smokingrelated diseases our goal is to develop products whose potential for risk reduction can be substantiated and provide adult smokers the taste sensory experience and smoking ritual characteristics that are as close as possible to those currently provided by conventional cigarettes we may not succeed in these efforts if we do not succeed but others do we may be at a competitive disadvantage furthermore we cannot predict whether regulators will permit the marketing of tobacco products with claims of reduced risk and harm which could significantly undermine the commercial viability of these products 

our reported results could be adversely affected by unfavorable currency exchange rates and currency devaluations could impair our competitiveness 

we conduct our business primarily in local currency and for purposes of financial reporting the local currency results are translated into us dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period during times of a strengthening us dollar our reported net revenues and operating income will be reduced because the local currency will translate into fewer us dollars during periods of local economic crises foreign currencies may be devalued significantly against the us dollar reducing our margins actions to recover margins may result in lower volume and a weaker competitive position 

the repatriation of our foreign earnings changes in the earnings mix and changes in us tax laws may increase our effective tax rate our ability to receive payments from foreign subsidiaries or to repatriate royalties and dividends could be restricted by local country currency exchange controls 

because we are a us holding company our most significant source of funds is distributions from our nonus subsidiaries under current us tax law in general we do not pay us taxes on our foreign earnings until they are repatriated to the us as distributions from our nonus subsidiaries these distributions may result in a residual us tax cost it may be advantageous to us in certain circumstances to significantly increase the amount of such distributions which could result in a material increase in our overall effective tax rate additionally the obama administration has indicated that it favors changes in us tax law that would fundamentally change how our earnings are taxed in the us if enacted and depending upon its precise terms such legislation could increase our overall effective tax rate certain countries in which we operate have adopted or could institute currency exchange controls that limit or prohibit our local subsidiaries ability to make payments outside the country 

our ability to grow may be limited by our inability to introduce new products enter new markets or to improve our margins through higher pricing and improvements in our brand and geographic mix 

our profitability may suffer if we are unable to introduce new products or enter new markets successfully to raise prices or maintain an acceptable proportion of our sales of higher margin products and sales in higher margin geographies 

we may be unable to expand our brand portfolio through successful acquisitions and the development of strategic business relationships 

one element of our growth strategy is to strengthen our brand portfolio and market positions through selective acquisitions and the development of strategic business relationships acquisition and strategic business development opportunities are limited and present risks of failing to achieve efficient and effective integration strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings there is no assurance that we will be able to acquire attractive businesses on favorable terms or that future acquisitions or strategic business developments will be accretive to earnings 

government mandated prices production control programs shifts in crops driven by economic conditions and the impacts of climate change may increase the cost or reduce the quality of the tobacco and other agricultural products used to manufacture our products 

as with other agricultural commodities the price of tobacco leaf and cloves can be influenced by imbalances in supply and demand and crop quality can be influenced by variations in weather patterns including those caused by climate change tobacco production in certain countries is subject to a variety of controls including government mandated prices and production control programs changes in the patterns of demand for agricultural products could cause farmers to plant less tobacco any significant change in tobacco leaf and clove prices quality and quantity could affect our profitability and our business 

 10  

our ability to implement our strategy of attracting and retaining the best global talent may be impaired by the decreasing social acceptance of cigarette smoking 

the tobacco industry competes for talent with consumer products and other companies that enjoy greater societal acceptance as a result we may be unable to attract and retain the best global talent 

the failure of our information systems to function as intended or their penetration by outside parties with the intent to corrupt them could result in business disruption loss of revenue assets or personal or other sensitive data 

we use information systems to help manage business processes collect and interpret business data and communicate internally and externally with employees suppliers customers and others some of these information systems are managed by thirdparty service providers we have backup systems and business continuity plans in place and we take care to protect our systems and data from unauthorized access nevertheless failure of our systems to function as intended or penetration of our systems by outside parties intent on extracting or corrupting information or otherwise disrupting business processes could result in loss of revenue assets or personal or other sensitive data cause damage to our reputation and that of our brands and result in significant remediation and other costs to us 

we may be required to replace third party contract manufacturers or service providers with our own resources 

in certain instances we contract with third parties to manufacture some of our products or product parts or to provide other services we may be unable to renew these agreements on satisfactory terms for numerous reasons including government regulations accordingly our costs may increase significantly if we must replace such third parties with our own resources

tobaccorelated litigation 

  

legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened against us andor our subsidiaries andor our indemnitees in various jurisdictions our indemnitees include distributors licensees and others that have been named as parties in certain cases and that we have agreed to defend as well as to pay costs and some or all of judgments if any that may be entered against them pursuant to the terms of the distribution agreement between altria and pmi pmi will indemnify altria and pm usa for tobacco product claims based in substantial part on products manufactured by pmi or contract manufactured for pmi by pm usa and pm usa will indemnify pmi for tobacco product claims based in substantial part on products manufactured by pm usa excluding tobacco products contract manufactured for pmi 

it is possible that there could be adverse developments in pending cases against us and our subsidiaries an unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobaccorelated litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation 

damages claimed in some of the tobaccorelated litigation are significant and in certain cases in brazil canada israel and nigeria range into the billions of us dollars the variability in pleadings in multiple jurisdictions together with the actual experience of management in litigating claims demonstrate that the monetary relief that may be specified in a lawsuit bears little relevance to the ultimate outcome much of the tobaccorelated litigation is in its early stages and litigation is subject to uncertainty however as discussed below we have to date been largely successful in defending tobaccorelated litigation 

we and our subsidiaries record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated at the present time while it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur after assessing the information available to it i management has not concluded that it is probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending tobaccorelated cases ii management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss for any of the pending tobaccorelated cases and iii accordingly no estimated loss has been accrued in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes in these cases if any legal defense costs are expensed as incurred 

it is possible that our consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation nevertheless although litigation is subject to uncertainty we and each of our subsidiaries named as a defendant believe and each has been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases that we have valid defenses to the litigation pending against us as well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts if any all such cases are and will continue to be vigorously defended however we and our subsidiaries may enter into settlement discussions in particular cases if we believe it is in our best interests to do so 

to date we have paid total judgments including costs of approximately six thousand  euros in tobaccorelated cases these payments were made in order to appeal three italian small claims cases all of which were subsequently reversed on appeal to date no  tobaccorelated case has been finally resolved in favor of a plaintiff against us our subsidiaries or indemnitees 

 12  

the table below lists the number of tobaccorelated cases pending against us andor our subsidiaries or indemnitees as of february 15 2013  december 31 2011  and december 31 2010  

  



since 1995 when the first tobaccorelated litigation was filed against a pmi entity 394 smoking and health lights health care cost recovery and public civil actions in which we andor one  of our subsidiaries andor indemnitees were a defendant have been terminated in our favor ten  cases have had decisions in favor of plaintiffs seven  of these cases have subsequently reached final resolution in our favor and three  remain on appeal

our portfolio of international and local brands is led by marlboro  the world’s best selling international cigarette which accounted for approximately 33 of our total 2011 shipment volume marlboro is complemented in the premiumprice category by merit  parliament and virginia slims  our leading midprice brands are lm and chesterfield  other leading international brands include bond street  lark  muratti  next  philip morris and red  white

separation from altria group inc 

  

we were a wholly owned subsidiary of altria group inc “altria” until the distribution of all of our shares owned by altria the “spinoff” was made on march 28 2008 the “distribution date” 

  

acquisitions and other business arrangements 

  

during 2011 2010 and 2009 we expanded our business with the following transactions 

  

2011 

  

in june 2011 we completed the acquisition of a cigarette business in jordan consisting primarily of cigarette manufacturing assets and inventories for 42 million in january 2011 we acquired a cigar business consisting primarily of trademarks in the australian and new zealand markets for 20 million 

  

effective january 1 2011 we established a new business structure with vietnam national tobacco corporation “vinataba” in vietnam further developing our existing joint venture with vinataba through the licensing of marlboro and establishing a pmicontrolled branch for the building of our brands 

  

2010 

  

in february 2010 our affiliate philip morris philippines manufacturing inc “pmpmi” and fortune tobacco corporation “ftc” combined their respective business activities by transferring selected assets and liabilities of pmpmi and ftc to a new company called pmftc inc “pmftc” pmpmi and ftc hold equal economic interests in pmftc while we manage the daytoday operations of pmftc and have a majority of its board of directors the establishment of pmftc permits both parties to benefit from their complementary brand portfolios as well as cost synergies from the resulting integration of manufacturing distribution and procurement and the further development and advancement of tobacco growing in the philippines 

  

in june 2010 we announced that our affiliate philip morris brasil industria e comercio ltda “pmb” would begin directly sourcing tobacco leaf from approximately 17000 tobacco farmers in southern brazil this initiative has enhanced pmi’s direct involvement in the supply chain and provides approximately 10 of pmi’s global leaf requirements the vertically integrated structure was made possible following separate agreements with two leaf suppliers in brazil alliance one brasil exportadora de tabacos ltda “aob” and universal leaf tabacos ltda “ult” these agreements resulted in aob and ult assigning approximately 9000 and 8000 contracts with tobacco farmers to pmb respectively as a result pmb offered employment to more than 200 employees most of them agronomy specialists and acquired related assets in southern brazil the purchase price for the net assets and the contractual relationships was 83 million

we are a legal entity separate and distinct from our direct and indirect subsidiaries accordingly our right and thus the right of our creditors and stockholders to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of any subsidiary is subject to the prior claims of creditors of such subsidiary except to the extent that claims of our company itself as a creditor may be recognized as a holding company our principal sources of funds including funds to make payment on our debt securities are from the receipt of dividends and repayment of debt from our subsidiaries our principal wholly owned and majorityowned subsidiaries currently are not limited by longterm debt or other agreements in their ability to pay cash dividends or to make other distributions with respect to their common stock 

  

b financial information about segments 

  

we divide our markets into four geographic regions which constitute our segments for financial reporting purposes 

  

   

   

   

   

net revenues and operating companies income  together with a reconciliation to operating income attributable to each such segment for each of the last three years are set forth in note 12 segment reporting to our consolidated financial statements which is incorporated herein by reference to the 2011 annual report see part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a discussion of our operating results by business segment 

  

the relative percentages of operating companies income attributable to each reportable segment were as follows 

 

   

we use the term net revenues to refer to our operating revenues from the sale of our products net of sales and promotion incentives our net revenues and operating income are affected by various factors including the volume of products we sell the price of our products changes in currency exchange rates and the mix of products we sell mix is a term used to refer to the proportionate value of premiumprice brands to midprice or lowprice brands in any given market product mix mix can also refer to the proportion of shipment volume in more profitable markets versus shipment volume in less profitable markets geographic mix we often collect excise taxes from our customers and then remit them to local governments and in those circumstances we include excise taxes in our net revenues and excise taxes on products our cost of sales consists principally of tobacco leaf nontobacco raw materials labor and manufacturing costs 

  

our marketing administration and research costs include the costs of marketing our products other costs generally not related to the manufacture of our products including general corporate 

   

expenses and costs incurred to develop new products the most significant components of our marketing administration and research costs are marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses

our subsidiaries and affiliates and their licensees manufacture market and sell tobacco products outside the united states 

  

our total cigarette shipments increased 17 in 2011 to 9153 billion units we estimate that international cigarette market shipments were approximately 57 trillion units in 2011 a 11 increase over 2010 we estimate that our reported share of the international cigarette market which is defined as worldwide cigarette volume excluding the united states was approximately 160 in each of 2011 and 2010 and 154 in 2009 including the 2010 business combination with ftc on a proforma basis our total share of the international cigarette market was 162 and 165 in 2010 and 2009 respectively

distribution and sales 

  

the distribution and sales strategy for our products is tailored to the characteristics of each market including retailer needs and capabilities the wholesale infrastructure our competitive position costs and the regulatory framework our goal is to achieve speed efficiency and widespread availability of our products while contributing to the success of our direct and indirect trade partners the four main types of distribution that we use across the globe often simultaneously in a given market are 

  

   

   

   

   

in many countries we also directly service key accounts including gas stations retail chains and supermarkets 

  

our distribution and sales systems are supported by sales forces that total approximately 16700 employees worldwide our sales forces are well trained and recognized by trade surveys for their professionalism they have over time developed a longlasting relationship with the wholesale and retail trade thus providing us with a superior presence at the point of sale reflected by our leading market share position in many markets in addition our consumer engagement teams work together with the sales forces to engage adult smokers in promotional activities and to support new product launches where permitted by law

competition 

  

we are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business we compete primarily on the basis of product quality brand recognition brand loyalty taste innovation packaging service marketing advertising and retail price our competitors include three large international tobacco companies and several regional and local tobacco companies and in some instances stateowned tobacco enterprises principally in algeria egypt the prc taiwan thailand and vietnam industry consolidation and privatizations of stateowned enterprises have led to an overall increase in competitive pressures some competitors have different profit and volume objectives and some international competitors are less susceptible to changes in currency exchange rates we compete predominantly with american type blended cigarette brands such as marlboro  lm and chesterfield  which are the most popular across many of our markets we seek to compete in all profitable retail price categories although our brand portfolio is weighted towards the premium category 

  

procurement and raw materials 

  

we purchase tobacco leaf of various grades and styles throughout the world the majority through independent tobacco suppliers we also contract directly with farmers in several countries including brazil the united states pakistan argentina the philippines poland italy colombia ecuador mexico the dominican republic and kazakhstan 

  

as discussed above in june 2010 we announced that our affiliate pmb began directly sourcing tobacco leaf from tobacco farmers in southern brazil this initiative enhances pmi’s direct involvement in the supply chain and provides approximately 10 of pmi’s global leaf requirements 

  

our largest sources of supply are 

  

   

   

   

   

   

we believe that there is an adequate supply of tobacco in the world markets to satisfy our current and anticipated production requirements 

  

in addition to tobacco leaf we purchase a wide variety of direct materials from a total of approximately 430 suppliers our top ten suppliers of direct materials combined represent more than 55 of our total direct materials purchases the three most significant direct materials that we purchase are printed paper board used in packaging acetate tow used in filter making and fine paper used in cigarette manufacturing in addition the supply of cloves is of particular importance to our indonesian business

research and development 

  

one of the top priorities of our research efforts is the development of a variety of innovative next generation products ngps that have the potential to reduce the risk of smokingrelated diseases in comparison to conventional cigarettes in developing these products in its stateoftheart rd facilities pmi draws upon a team of worldclass scientists from a broad spectrum of scientific disciplines in 2011 we further enhanced our product development capabilities by acquiring the global patent rights for a new technology that employs a unique method for delivering a nicotinecontaining aerosol prior to commercialization we are employing rigorous scientific methodologies to evaluate and substantiate the ability of these products to reduce the individual risk of smokingrelated diseases 

  

compared to conventional tobacco products and their impact on the population as a whole we cannot predict whether we will succeed in developing commercially viable ngps or whether regulators will permit the marketing of ngps with claims of reduced risk 

  

we also conduct research to support and reinforce our conventional product business we seek to be at the forefront of innovation significant investments have been made in new product development efforts for conventional products resulting in a wide range of product enhancements and the launch of innovative new products further with the increase in product regulations support for the conventional cigarette business has expanded and is expected to become more complex requiring additional capacity for analysis and testing in compliance with applicable laws and regulations 

  

finally working through biotechnology partners we are conducting research and development on technology platforms that can potentially lead to the development of alternative uses of tobacco 

  

the research and development expense for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 is set forth in note 14 additional information to our consolidated financial statements which is incorporated herein by reference to the 2011 annual report

 item 1a risk factors tableend   

the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business our operating results our financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forwardlooking statements are made in this annual report 

  

forwardlooking and cautionary statements 

  

we may from time to time make written or oral forwardlooking statements including statements contained in filings with the sec in reports to stockholders and in press releases and investor webcasts you can identify these forwardlooking statements by use of words such as “strategy” “expects” “continues” “plans” “anticipates” “believes” “will” “estimates” “intends” “projects” “goals” “targets” and other words of similar meaning you can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 

  

we cannot guarantee that any forwardlooking statement will be realized although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions achievement of future results is subject to risks uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate actual results could vary materially from those anticipated estimated or projected investors should bear this in mind as they consider forwardlooking statements and whether to invest in or remain invested in our securities in connection with the “safe harbor” provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 we are identifying important factors that individually or in the aggregate could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements made by us any such statement is qualified by reference to the following cautionary statements we elaborate on these and other risks we face throughout this document particularly in the “business environment” section you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors consequently you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties we do not undertake to update any forwardlooking statement that we may make from time to time except in the normal course of our public disclosure obligations 

  

risks related to our business and industry 

  

cigarettes are subject to substantial taxes significant increases in cigaretterelated taxes have been proposed or enacted and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted in numerous jurisdictions these tax increases may disproportionately affect our profitability and make us less competitive versus certain of our competitors 

  

tax regimes including excise taxes sales taxes and import duties can disproportionately affect the retail price of manufactured cigarettes versus other tobacco products or disproportionately affect the relative retail price of our manufactured cigarette brands versus cigarette brands manufactured by certain of our competitors because our portfolio is weighted toward the premiumprice manufactured cigarette category tax regimes based on sales price can place us at a competitive disadvantage in certain markets as a result our volume and profitability may be adversely affected in these markets 

  

increases in cigarette taxes are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on our sales of cigarettes due to resulting lower consumption levels a shift in sales from manufactured cigarettes to other tobacco products and from the premiumprice to the midprice or lowprice cigarette categories where we may be underrepresented from local sales to legal crossborder purchases of lower price products or to illicit products such as contraband and counterfeit 

  

our business faces significant governmental action aimed at increasing regulatory requirements with the goal of preventing the use of tobacco products 

  

governmental actions combined with the diminishing social acceptance of smoking and private actions to restrict smoking have resulted in reduced industry volume in many of our markets and we expect that such factors will continue to reduce consumption levels and will increase downtrading and the risk of counterfeiting contraband and crossborder purchases significant regulatory developments will take place over the next few years in most of our markets driven principally by the world health organization’s framework convention on tobacco control “fctc” the fctc is the first international public health treaty on tobacco and its objective is to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation the fctc has led to increased efforts by tobacco control advocates and public health organizations to reduce the palatability and attractiveness of tobacco products to adult smokers regulatory initiatives that have been proposed introduced or enacted include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

our operating income could be significantly affected by regulatory initiatives resulting in a significant decrease in demand for our brands in particular requirements that lead to a commoditization of tobacco products as well as any significant increase in the cost of complying with new regulatory requirements 

  

litigation related to tobacco use and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke “ets” could substantially reduce our profitability and could severely impair our liquidity 

  

there is litigation related to tobacco products pending in certain jurisdictions damages claimed in some tobaccorelated litigation are significant and in certain cases in brazil canada israel and nigeria range into the billions of us dollars we anticipate that new cases will continue to be filed the fctc encourages litigation against tobacco product manufacturers it is possible that our consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation see item 3 legal proceedings of this form 10k 

  

we face intense competition and our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations 

  

we compete primarily on the basis of product quality brand recognition brand loyalty taste innovation packaging service marketing advertising and price we are subject to highly competitive 

  

conditions in all aspects of our business the competitive environment and our competitive position can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions erosion of consumer confidence competitors’ introduction of lowerprice products or innovative products higher tobacco product taxes higher absolute prices and larger gaps between retail price categories and product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate tobacco products competitors include three large international tobacco companies and several regional and local tobacco companies and in some instances stateowned tobacco enterprises principally in algeria egypt the prc taiwan thailand and vietnam industry consolidation and privatizations of stateowned enterprises have led to an overall increase in competitive pressures some competitors have different profit and volume objectives and some international competitors are less susceptible to changes in currency exchange rates 

  

because we have operations in numerous countries our results may be influenced by economic regulatory and political developments in many countries 

  

some of the countries in which we operate face the threat of civil unrest and can be subject to regime changes in others nationalization terrorism conflict and the threat of war may have a significant impact on the business environment economic political regulatory or other developments could disrupt our supply chain or our distribution capabilities in addition such developments could lead to loss of property or equipment that are critical to our business in certain markets and difficulty in staffing and managing our operations which could reduce our volumes revenues and net earnings in certain markets we are dependent on governmental approvals of various actions such as price changes 

  

in addition despite our high ethical standards and rigorous control and compliance procedures aimed at preventing and detecting unlawful conduct given the breadth and scope of our international operations we may not be able to detect all potential improper or unlawful conduct by our employees and international partners 

  

we may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences or to respond to consumer behavior influenced by economic downturns 

  

our tobacco business is subject to changes in consumer preferences which may be influenced by local economic conditions to be successful we must 

  

   

   

   

   

   

in periods of economic uncertainty consumers may tend to purchase lowerprice brands and the volume of our premiumprice and midprice brands and our profitability could suffer accordingly 

  

we lose revenues as a result of counterfeiting contraband and crossborder purchases 

  

large quantities of counterfeit cigarettes are sold in the international market we believe that marlboro is the most heavily counterfeited international cigarette brand although we cannot quantify the revenues we lose as a result of this activity in addition our revenues are reduced by contraband and legal crossborder purchases 

  

from time to time we are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters 

  

investigations include allegations of contraband shipments of cigarettes allegations of unlawful pricing activities within certain markets allegations of underpayment of customs duties andor excise taxes and allegations of false and misleading usage of descriptors such as “lights” and “ultra lights” we cannot predict the outcome of those investigations or whether additional investigations may be commenced and it is possible that our business could be materially affected by an unfavorable outcome of pending or future investigations see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—operating results by business segment—business environment—governmental investigations” for a description of governmental investigations to which we are subject 

  

we may be unsuccessful in our attempts to produce products with the potential to reduce the risk of smokingrelated diseases 

  

we continue to seek ways to develop commercially viable new product technologies that may reduce the risk of smoking our goal is to develop products whose potential for risk reduction can be substantiated and meet adult smokers’ taste expectations we may not succeed in these efforts if we do not succeed but others do we may be at a competitive disadvantage furthermore we cannot predict whether regulators will permit the marketing of tobacco products with claims of reduced risk to consumers which could significantly undermine the commercial viability of these products 

  

our reported results could be adversely affected by unfavorable currency exchange rates and currency devaluations could impair our competitiveness 

  

we conduct our business primarily in local currency and for purposes of financial reporting the local currency results are translated into us dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period during times of a strengthening us dollar our reported net revenues and operating income will be reduced because the local currency will translate into fewer us dollars during periods of local economic crises foreign currencies may be devalued significantly against the us dollar reducing our margins actions to recover margins may result in lower volume and a weaker competitive position 

  

the repatriation of our foreign earnings changes in the earnings mix and changes in us tax laws may increase our effective tax rate 

  

because we are a us holding company our most significant source of funds is distributions from our nonus subsidiaries under current us tax law in general we do not pay us taxes on our foreign earnings until they are repatriated to the us as distributions from our nonus subsidiaries these distributions may result in a residual us tax cost it may be advantageous to us in certain circumstances to significantly increase the amount of such distributions which could result in a material increase in our overall effective tax rate additionally the obama administration has indicated that it favors changes in us tax law that would fundamentally change how our earnings are taxed in the us if enacted and depending upon its precise terms such legislation could increase our overall effective tax rate 

  

our ability to grow may be limited by our inability to introduce new products enter new markets or to improve our margins through higher pricing and improvements in our brand and geographic mix 

  

our profitability may suffer if we are unable to introduce new products or enter new markets successfully to raise prices or maintain an acceptable proportion of our sales of higher margin products and sales in higher margin geographies 

  

we may be unable to expand our brand portfolio through successful acquisitions and the development of strategic business relationships 

  

one element of our growth strategy is to strengthen our brand portfolio and market positions through selective acquisitions and the development of strategic business relationships acquisition and strategic business development opportunities are limited and present risks of failing to achieve efficient and effective integration strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings there is no assurance that we will be able to acquire attractive businesses on favorable terms or that future acquisitions or strategic business developments will be accretive to earnings 

  

government mandated prices production control programs shifts in crops driven by economic conditions and the impacts of climate change may increase the cost or reduce the quality of the tobacco and other agricultural products used to manufacture our products 

  

as with other agricultural commodities the price of tobacco leaf and cloves can be influenced by imbalances in supply and demand and crop quality can be influenced by variations in weather patterns including those caused by climate change tobacco production in certain countries is subject to a variety of controls including government mandated prices and production control programs changes in the patterns of demand for agricultural products could cause farmers to plant less tobacco any significant change in tobacco leaf and clove prices quality and quantity could affect our profitability and our business 

  

our ability to implement our strategy of attracting and retaining the best global talent may be impaired by the decreasing social acceptance of cigarette smoking 

  

the tobacco industry competes for talent with consumer products and other companies that enjoy greater societal acceptance as a result we may be unable to attract and retain the best global talent 

  

the failure of our information systems to function as intended or their penetration by outside parties with the intent to corrupt them could result in business disruption loss of revenue assets or personal or other sensitive data 

  

we use information systems to help manage business processes collect and interpret business data and communicate internally and externally with employees suppliers customers and others some of these information systems are managed by thirdparty service providers we have backup systems and business continuity plans in place and we take care to protect our systems and data from unauthorized access nevertheless failure of our systems to function as intended or penetration of our systems by outside parties intent on extracting or corrupting information or otherwise disrupting business processes could result in loss of revenue assets or personal or other sensitive data cause damage to our reputation and that of our brands and result in significant remediation and other costs to us

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend   

litigation—general 

  

legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened against us andor our subsidiaries andor our indemnitees in various jurisdictions our indemnitees include distributors licensees and others that have been named as parties in certain cases and that we have agreed to defend as well as pay costs and some or all of judgments if any that may be entered against them pursuant to the terms of the distribution agreement between altria and pmi pmi will indemnify altria and pm usa for tobacco product claims based in substantial part on products manufactured by pmi or contract manufactured for pmi by pm usa and pm usa will indemnify pmi for tobacco product claims based in substantial part on products manufactured by pm usa excluding tobacco products contract manufactured for pmi various types of claims are raised in these proceedings including among others product liability consumer protection antitrust employment and tax 

  

it is possible that there could be adverse developments in pending cases against us and our subsidiaries an unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobaccorelated litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation 

  

damages claimed in some of the tobaccorelated litigation are significant and in certain cases in brazil canada israel and nigeria range into the billions of dollars the variability in pleadings in multiple jurisdictions together with the actual experience of management in litigating claims demonstrate that the monetary relief that may be specified in a lawsuit bears little relevance to the ultimate outcome much of the tobaccorelated litigation is in its early stages and litigation is subject to uncertainty however as discussed below we have to date been largely successful in defending tobaccorelated litigation 

  

we and our subsidiaries record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated at the present time while it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur after assessing the information available to it i management has not concluded that it is probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending tobaccorelated cases ii management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss for any of the pending tobaccorelated cases and iii accordingly no estimated loss has been accrued in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes in these cases if any legal defense costs are expensed as incurred 

  

it is possible that our consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation nevertheless although litigation is subject to uncertainty we and each of our subsidiaries named as a defendant believe and each has been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases that we have valid defenses to the litigation pending against us as well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts if any all such cases are and will continue to be vigorously defended however we and our subsidiaries may enter into settlement discussions in particular cases if we believe it is in our best interests to do so 

  

the table below lists the number of tobaccorelated cases pending against us andor our subsidiaries or indemnitees as of february 15 2012 december 31 2010 and december 31 2009 

 

   

since 1995 when the first tobaccorelated litigation was filed against a pmi entity 377 smoking and health lights health care cost recovery and public civil actions in which we andor one of our subsidiaries andor indemnitees were a defendant have been terminated in our favor ten cases have had decisions in favor of plaintiffs six of these cases have subsequently reached final resolution in our favor and four remain on appeal to date we have paid total judgments including costs of approximately six thousand euros these payments were made in order to appeal three italian small claims cases two of which were subsequently reversed on appeal and one of which remains on appeal to date no tobaccorelated case has been finally resolved in favor of a plaintiff against us our subsidiaries or indemnitees

our portfolio of international and local brands is led by marlboro  the world’s best selling international cigarette which accounted for approximately 33 of our total 2010 shipment volume marlboro is complemented in the premiumprice category by merit parliament and virginia slims  our leading midprice brands are lm and chesterfield  other leading international brands include bond street  lark  muratti next philip morris and red  white  

  

we also own a number of important local brands such as sampoerna a  dji sam soe and sampoerna hijau in indonesia fortune  champion and hope in the philippines diana in italy optima and apollosoyuz in russia morven gold in pakistan boston in colombia belmont canadian classics and number 7 in canada best and classic in serbia f6 in germany delicados in mexico assos in greece and petra in the czech republic and slovakia while there are a number of markets where local brands remain important international brands are expanding their share in numerous markets with international brands contributing approximately 70 of our shipment volume in 2010 we are well positioned to continue to benefit from this trend 

  

separation from altria group inc 

  

we were a wholly owned subsidiary of altria group inc “altria” until the distribution of all of our shares owned by altria the “spinoff” was made on march 28 2008 the “distribution date” 

  

acquisitions and other business arrangements 

  

one element of our growth strategy is to strengthen our brand portfolio andor expand our geographic reach through an active program of selective acquisitions and the development of strategic business relationships we are constantly evaluating potential acquisition opportunities and strategic projects from time to time we may engage in confidential negotiations that are not publicly announced unless and until those negotiations result in a definitive agreement during 2010 2009 and 2008 we have expanded our business with the following transactions 

  

2010 

  

in february 2010 our affiliate philip morris philippines manufacturing inc “pmpmi” and fortune tobacco corporation “ftc” combined their respective business activities by transferring selected assets and liabilities of pmpmi and ftc to a new company called pmftc inc “pmftc” pmpmi and ftc hold equal economic interests in pmftc while we manage the daytoday operations of pmftc and have a majority of its board of directors the establishment of pmftc permits both parties to benefit from their respective complementary brand portfolios as well as cost synergies from the 

  

resulting integration of manufacturing distribution and procurement and the further development and advancement of tobacco growing in the philippines 

  

in june 2010 we announced that our affiliate philip morris brasil industria e comercio ltda “pmb” will begin directly sourcing tobacco leaf from approximately 17000 tobacco farmers in southern brazil this initiative enhances pmi’s direct involvement in the supply chain and is expected to provide approximately 10 of pmi’s global leaf requirements the vertically integrated structure was made possible following separate agreements with two current leaf suppliers in brazil alliance one brasil exportadora de tabacos ltda “aob” and universal leaf tabacos ltda “ult” these agreements resulted in aob assigning approximately 9000 contracts with tobacco farmers to pmb and ult assigning approximately 8000 contracts with tobacco farmers to pmb as a result pmb offered employment to more than 200 employees most of them agronomy specialists and acquired related assets in southern brazil the purchase price for the net assets and the contractual relationships was 83 million

2008 

  

in october 2008 we completed the acquisition of rothmans inc “rothmans” which is located in canada for cad 20 billion approximately 19 billion based on exchange rates prevailing at the time of the acquisition prior to our acquisition rothmans’ sole holding was a 60 interest in rothmans benson  hedges inc “rbh” the remaining 40 interest in rbh was owned by us 

  

in june 2008 we purchased the fine cut trademark interval and certain other trademarks in the other tobacco products category “otp” from imperial tobacco group plc for 407 million 

  

other 

  

effective january 1 2011 we established a new business structure with vietnam national tobacco corporation “vinataba” in vietnam under the terms of the agreement we will further develop our existing joint venture with vinataba through the licensing of marlboro and the establishment of a pmicontrolled branch for the business building of our brands the vietnamese cigarette market is the fourteenth largest in the world excluding the usa with an estimated 2010 volume of 77 billion cigarettes 

  

source of funds — dividends 

  

we are a legal entity separate and distinct from our direct and indirect subsidiaries accordingly our right and thus the right of our creditors and stockholders to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of any subsidiary is subject to the prior claims of creditors of such subsidiary except to the extent that claims of our company itself as a creditor may be recognized as a holding company our principal sources of funds including funds to make payment on our debt securities are from the receipt of dividends and repayment of debt from our subsidiaries our principal wholly owned and majorityowned subsidiaries currently are not limited by longterm debt or other agreements in their ability to pay cash dividends or to make other distributions with respect to their common stock 

  

b financial information about segments 

  

we divide our markets into four geographic regions which constitute our segments for financial reporting purposes 

  

   

   

   

   

net revenues and operating companies income together with a reconciliation to operating income attributable to each such segment for each of the last three years are set forth in note 12 segment reporting to our consolidated financial statements which is incorporated herein by reference to the 2010 annual report see part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a discussion of our operating results by business segment 

  

the relative percentages of operating companies income attributable to each reportable segment were as follows 

  

    

we use the term net revenues to refer to our operating revenues from the sale of our products net of sales and promotion incentives our net revenues and operating income are affected by various factors including the volume of products we sell the price of our products changes in currency exchange rates and the mix of products we sell mix is a term used to refer to the proportionate value of premiumprice brands to midprice or lowprice brands in any given market product mix mix can also refer to the proportion of volume in more profitable markets versus volume in less profitable markets geographic mix we often collect excise taxes from our customers and then remit them to local governments and in those circumstances we include excise taxes in our net revenues and excise taxes on products our cost of sales consists principally of tobacco leaf nontobacco raw materials labor and manufacturing costs 

  

our marketing administration and research costs include the costs of marketing our products other costs generally not related to the manufacture of our products including general corporate expenses and costs incurred to develop new products the most significant components of our marketing administration and research costs are selling and marketing expenses which relate to the cost of our sales force as well as to the advertising and promotion of our products 

  

c narrative description of business 

  

our subsidiaries and affiliates and their licensees manufacture market and sell tobacco products outside the united states 

  

our total cigarette shipments increased 41 in 2010 to 8999 billion units we estimate that international cigarette market shipments were approximately 56 trillion units in 2010 a 01 increase over 2009 we estimate that our reported share of the international cigarette market which is defined as worldwide cigarette volume excluding the united states was approximately 160 154 and 157 in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively including the business combination with ftc on a proforma basis our total share of the international cigarette market was 162 and 165 in 2010 and 2009 respectively 

  

excluding the people’s republic of china “prc” we estimate that our reported share of the international cigarette market was approximately 276 259 and 258 in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively including the business combination with ftc on a proforma basis our total share of the international cigarette market excluding the prc was 279 and 277 in 2010 and 2009 respectively 

  

shipments of our principal brand marlboro  decreased 15 in 2010 and represented approximately 91 of the international cigarette market excluding the prc in 2010 90 in 2009 and 91 in 2008 

  

we have a cigarette market share of at least 15 and in a number of instances substantially more than 15 in approximately 90 markets including algeria argentina australia austria belgium canada colombia the czech republic finland france germany greece hungary indonesia italy japan kazakhstan mexico the netherlands the philippines poland portugal romania russia saudi arabia serbia singapore spain sweden switzerland turkey and ukraine 

  

references to total international cigarette market total cigarette market total market and market shares in this form 10k are our estimates based on a number of internal and external sources 

  

distribution and sales 

  

the distribution and sales strategy for our products is tailored to the characteristics of each market including retailer needs and capabilities the wholesale infrastructure our competitive position costs and the regulatory framework our goal is to achieve speed efficiency and widespread availability of our products while contributing to the success of our direct and indirect trade partners the four main types of distribution that we use across the globe often simultaneously in a given market are 

  

   

   

   

   

in many countries we also directly service key accounts including gas stations retail chains and supermarkets 

  

our distribution and sales systems are supported by sales forces that total approximately 16400 employees worldwide our sales forces are well trained and recognized by trade surveys for their professionalism they have over time developed a long lasting relationship with the wholesale and retail trade thus providing us with a superior presence at the point of sale reflecting our leading market share position in many markets in addition our consumer engagement teams work together with the sales forces to engage adult smokers in promotional activities and to support new product launches 

  

our products are marketed and promoted through various media and channels including where permitted by law point of sale communications brand events accessrestricted web sites print new digital technologies and direct communication to verified adult smokers our direct communication with verified adult smokers utilizes mail email and other electronic communication tools promotional activities include where permitted by law competitions invitation to events interactive programs consumer premiums and price promotions to support advertising and promotional activities in the markets we have a dedicated consumer engagement group that develops innovative engagement tools based on the latest technologies and consumer trends 

  

competition 

  

we are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business we compete primarily on the basis of product quality brand recognition brand loyalty taste innovation packaging service marketing advertising and price our competitors include three large international tobacco companies and several regional and local tobacco companies and in some instances stateowned tobacco enterprises principally in china egypt thailand taiwan vietnam and algeria industry consolidation and privatizations of stateowned enterprises have led to an overall increase in competitive pressures some competitors have different profit and volume objectives and some international competitors are less susceptible to changes in currency exchange rates we compete predominantly with american type blended cigarettes such as marlboro lm and chesterfield  which are the most popular across many of our markets we seek to compete in all profitable price segments 

  

procurement and raw materials 

  

we purchase tobacco leaf of various grades and styles throughout the world the majority through independent tobacco suppliers we also contract directly with farmers in several countries including the united states argentina brazil mexico indonesia ecuador dominican republic poland colombia the philippines and pakistan 

  

as discussed above in june 2010 we announced that our affiliate pmb will begin directly sourcing tobacco leaf from tobacco farmers in southern brazil this initiative enhances pmi’s direct involvement in the supply chain and is expected to provide approximately 10 of pmi’s global leaf requirements 

  

our largest sources of supply are 

  

   

   

   

   

   

we believe that there is an adequate supply of tobacco in the world markets to satisfy our current and anticipated production requirements 

  

in addition to tobacco leaf we purchase a wide variety of other nontobacco materials from a total of approximately 400 suppliers our top 10 suppliers of nontobacco materials combined represent more than 45 of our total nontobacco material purchases the three most significant nontobacco materials that we purchase are printed paper board used in packaging acetate tow used in filter making and fine paper used in cigarette manufacturing in addition the supply of cloves is of particular importance to our indonesian business

our research efforts are focused on understanding the mechanisms of tobaccorelated diseases and specifically the complex role of tobacco smoke constituents in the development of tobaccorelated diseases this research serves as the cornerstone for our efforts to develop products that have the potential to reduce the risk of tobaccorelated diseases those efforts currently focus on smoke generation at lower temperatures heat generation and mass transfer biotechnology material science and the removal of certain harmful compounds from the tobacco leaf using agronomic practices we are undertaking research to enable us to predict whether and to what extent a product has the potential to reduce the risk of a disease caused by smoking this will be critical for making substantiated statements about the potential risk reduction of such products when commercializing them 

  

we also conduct research to support and reinforce our conventional product business we seek to be at the forefront of innovation significant investments have been made in new product development efforts for conventional products resulting in a wide range of product enhancements and the launch of innovative new products further with the increase in product regulations support for the conventional cigarette business has expanded and is expected to become more complex requiring additional capacity for analysis and testing in compliance with applicable laws and regulations 

  

finally working through biotechnology partners we are conducting research and development on technology platforms that can potentially lead to the development of alternative uses of tobacco 

  

the research and development expense for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 is set forth in note 14 additional information to our consolidated financial statements which is incorporated herein by reference to the 2010 annual report

 item 1a risk factors tableend   

the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business our operating results our financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forwardlooking statements are made in this annual report 

  

forwardlooking and cautionary statements 

  

we may from time to time make written or oral forwardlooking statements including statements contained in filings with the sec in reports to stockholders and in press releases and investor webcasts you can identify these forwardlooking statements by use of words such as “strategy” “expects” “continues” “plans” “anticipates” “believes” “will” “estimates” “intends” “projects” “goals” “targets” and other words of similar meaning you can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 

  

we cannot guarantee that any forwardlooking statement will be realized although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions achievement of future results is subject to risks uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate actual results could vary materially from those anticipated estimated or projected investors should bear this in mind as they consider forwardlooking statements and whether to invest in or remain invested in our securities in connection with the “safe harbor” provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 we are identifying important factors that individually or in the aggregate could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements made by us any such statement is qualified by reference to the following cautionary statements we elaborate on these and other risks we face throughout this document particularly in the “business environment” section preceding our discussion of operating results of our business you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors consequently you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties we do not undertake to update any forwardlooking statement that we may make from time to time except in the normal course of our public disclosure obligations 

  

risks related to our business and industry 

  

cigarettes are subject to substantial taxes significant increases in cigaretterelated taxes have been proposed or enacted and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted in numerous jurisdictions these tax increases may affect our profitability disproportionately and make us less competitive versus certain of our competitors 

  

tax regimes including excise taxes sales taxes and import duties can disproportionately affect the retail price of manufactured cigarettes versus other tobacco products or disproportionately affect the relative retail price of our manufactured cigarette brands versus cigarette brands manufactured by certain of our competitors because our portfolio is weighted toward the premiumprice manufactured cigarette category tax regimes based on sales price can place us at a competitive disadvantage in certain markets as a result our volume and profitability may be adversely affected in these markets 

  

increases in cigarette taxes are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on our sales of cigarettes due to resulting lower consumption levels a shift in sales from manufactured cigarettes to other tobacco products and from the premiumprice to the midprice or lowprice cigarette categories where we may be underrepresented from local sales to legal crossborder purchases of lower price products or to illicit products such as contraband and counterfeit 

  

the elimination of minimum retail selling price systems in the european union may adversely affect our business 

  

during the first half of 2010 the european court of justice ruled against several eu member states austria france ireland and italy that had enacted laws establishing a minimum retail selling price for cigarettes and in some cases other tobacco products on the grounds that such systems infringe on eu law as a result austria and france have abolished their minimum retail selling price systems these developments could adversely impact excise tax levels and widen price gaps in those markets which may adversely affect our business 

  

our business faces significant governmental action aimed at increasing regulatory requirements with the goal of preventing the use of tobacco products 

  

governmental actions combined with the diminishing social acceptance of smoking and private actions to restrict smoking have resulted in reduced industry volume in many of our markets and we expect that such factors will continue to reduce consumption levels and will increase downtrading and the risk of counterfeiting contraband and crossborder purchases significant regulatory developments will take place over the next few years in most of our markets driven principally by the world health organization’s framework convention on tobacco control “fctc” the fctc is the first international public health treaty on tobacco and its objective is to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation the fctc has led to increased efforts by tobacco control advocates and public health organizations to reduce the palatability and attractiveness of tobacco products to adult smokers regulatory initiatives that have been proposed introduced or enacted include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

our operating income could be significantly affected by regulatory initiatives resulting in a significant decrease in demand for our brands in particular requirements that lead to a commoditization of tobacco products as well as any significant increase in the cost of complying with new regulatory requirements 

  

litigation related to cigarette smoking and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke “ets” could substantially reduce our profitability and could severely impair our liquidity 

  

there is litigation related to tobacco products pending in certain jurisdictions damages claimed in some of the tobaccorelated litigation are significant and in certain cases in brazil canada israel and 

  

nigeria range into the billions of dollars we anticipate that new cases will continue to be filed the fctc encourages litigation against tobacco product manufacturers it is possible that our consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation please see item 3 legal proceedings of this form 10k for a discussion of tobaccorelated litigation 

  

we face intense competition and our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations 

  

we compete primarily on the basis of product quality brand recognition brand loyalty taste innovation packaging service marketing advertising and price we are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business the competitive environment and our competitive position can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions erosion of consumer confidence competitors’ introduction of lowprice products or innovative products higher cigarette taxes higher absolute prices and larger gaps between price categories and product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate tobacco products competitors include three large international tobacco companies and several regional and local tobacco companies and in some instances stateowned tobacco enterprises principally in china egypt thailand taiwan vietnam and algeria industry consolidation and privatizations of stateowned enterprises have led to an overall increase in competitive pressures some competitors have different profit and volume objectives and some international competitors are less susceptible to changes in currency exchange rates 

  

because we have operations in numerous countries our results may be influenced by economic regulatory and political developments in many countries 

  

some of the countries in which we operate face the threat of civil unrest and can be subject to regime changes in others nationalization terrorism conflict and the threat of war may have a significant impact on the business environment economic political regulatory or other developments could disrupt our supply chain or our distribution capabilities in addition such developments could lead to loss of property or equipment that are critical to our business in certain markets and difficulty in staffing and managing our operations which could reduce our volumes revenues and net earnings in certain markets we are dependent on governmental approvals of various actions such as price changes 

  

in addition despite our high ethical standards and rigorous control and compliance procedures aimed at preventing and detecting unlawful conduct given the breadth and scope of our international operations we may not be able to detect all potential improper or unlawful conduct by our employees and international partners 

  

we may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences or to respond to consumer behavior influenced by economic downturns 

  

our tobacco business is subject to changes in consumer preferences which may be influenced by local economic conditions to be successful we must 

  

   

   

   

   

   

in periods of economic uncertainty consumers may tend to purchase lower price brands and the volume of our premiumprice and midprice brands and our profitability could suffer accordingly 

  

we lose revenues as a result of counterfeiting contraband and crossborder purchases 

  

large quantities of counterfeit cigarettes are sold in the international market we believe that marlboro is the most heavily counterfeited international cigarette brand although we cannot quantify the amount of revenues we lose as a result of this activity in addition our revenues are reduced by contraband and legal crossborder purchases 

  

from time to time we are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters 

  

investigations include allegations of contraband shipments of cigarettes allegations of unlawful pricing activities within certain markets allegations of underpayment of custom duties andor excise taxes and allegations of false and misleading usage of descriptors such as “lights” and “ultra lights” we cannot predict the outcome of those investigations or whether additional investigations may be commenced and it is possible that our business could be materially affected by an unfavorable outcome of pending or future investigations see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—operating results by business segment—business environment—governmental investigations” for a description of governmental investigations to which we are subject 

  

we may be unsuccessful in our attempts to produce products with the potential to reduce the risk of smokingrelated diseases 

  

we continue to seek ways to develop commercially viable new product technologies that may reduce the risk of smoking our goal is to develop products whose potential for risk reduction can be substantiated and meet adult smokers’ taste expectations we may not succeed in these efforts if we do not succeed but others do we may be at a competitive disadvantage further we cannot predict whether regulators will permit the marketing of tobacco products with claims of reduced risk to consumers which could significantly undermine the commercial viability of these products 

  

our reported results could be adversely affected by currency exchange rates and currency devaluations could impair our competitiveness 

  

we conduct our business primarily in local currency and for purposes of financial reporting the local currency results are translated into us dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period during times of a strengthening us dollar our reported net revenues and operating income will be reduced because the local currency will translate into fewer us dollars during periods of local economic crises foreign currencies may be devalued significantly against the us dollar reducing our margins actions to recover margins may result in lower volume and a weaker competitive position 

  

the repatriation of our foreign earnings changes in the earnings mix and changes in us tax laws may increase our effective tax rate 

  

because we are a us holding company our most significant source of funds is distributions from our nonus subsidiaries under current us tax law in general we do not pay us taxes on our foreign earnings until they are repatriated to the us as distributions from our nonus subsidiaries these distributions may result in a residual us tax cost it may be advantageous to us in certain circumstances to significantly increase the amount of such distributions which could result in a material increase in our overall effective tax rate additionally the obama administration has indicated 

  

that it favors changes in us tax law that would fundamentally change how our earnings are taxed in the us if enacted and depending upon its precise terms such legislation could increase our overall effective tax rate 

  

our ability to grow may be limited by our inability to introduce new products enter new markets or to improve our margins through higher pricing and improvements in our brand and geographic mix 

  

our profitability may suffer if we are unable to introduce new products or enter new markets successfully to raise prices or maintain an acceptable proportion of our sales of higher margin products and sales in higher margin geographies 

  

we may be unable to expand our portfolio through successful acquisitions and the development of strategic business relationships 

  

one element of our growth strategy is to strengthen our brand portfolio and market positions through selective acquisitions and the development of strategic business relationships acquisition and strategic business development opportunities are limited and present risks of failing to achieve efficient and effective integration strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings there is no assurance that we will be able to acquire attractive businesses on favorable terms or that future acquisitions or strategic business developments will be accretive to earnings 

  

government mandated prices production control programs shifts in crops driven by economic conditions and the impacts of climate change may increase the cost or reduce the quality of the tobacco and other agricultural products used to manufacture our products 

  

as with other agricultural commodities the price of tobacco leaf and cloves can be influenced by imbalances in supply and demand and crop quality can be influenced by variations in weather patterns including those caused by climate change tobacco production in certain countries is subject to a variety of controls including government mandated prices and production control programs changes in the patterns of demand for agricultural products could cause farmers to plant less tobacco any significant change in tobacco leaf and clove prices quality and quantity could affect our profitability and our business 

  

our ability to implement our strategy of attracting and retaining the best global talent may be impaired by the decreasing social acceptance of cigarette smoking 

  

the tobacco industry competes for talent with consumer products and other companies that enjoy greater societal acceptance as a result we may be unable to attract and retain the best global talent

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend   

litigation—general 

  

legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened against us andor our subsidiaries andor our indemnitees in various jurisdictions our indemnitees include distributors licensees and others that have been named as parties in certain cases and that we have agreed to defend as well as pay costs and some or all of judgments if any that may be entered against them pursuant to the terms of the distribution agreement between altria and pmi pmi will indemnify altria and pm usa for tobacco product claims based in substantial part on products manufactured by pmi or contract manufactured for pmi by pm usa and pm usa will indemnify pmi for tobacco product claims based in substantial part on products manufactured by pm usa excluding tobacco products contract manufactured for pmi various types of claims are raised in these proceedings including among others product liability consumer protection antitrust employment and tax 

  

it is possible that there could be adverse developments in pending cases against us and our subsidiaries an unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobaccorelated litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation 

  

damages claimed in some of the tobaccorelated litigation are significant and in certain cases in brazil canada israel and nigeria range into the billions of dollars the variability in pleadings in multiple jurisdictions together with the actual experience of management in litigating claims demonstrate that the monetary relief that may be specified in a lawsuit bears little relevance to the 

  

ultimate outcome much of the tobaccorelated litigation is in its early stages and litigation is subject to uncertainty however as discussed below we have to date been largely successful in defending tobaccorelated litigation 

  

we and our subsidiaries record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated at the present time while it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur after assessing the information available to it i management has not concluded that it is probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending tobaccorelated cases ii management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss for any of the pending tobaccorelated cases and iii accordingly no estimated loss has been accrued in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes in these cases if any legal defense costs are expensed as incurred 

  

it is possible that our consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation nevertheless although litigation is subject to uncertainty we and each of our subsidiaries named as a defendant believe and each has been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases that we have valid defenses to the litigation pending against us as well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts if any all such cases are and will continue to be vigorously defended however we and our subsidiaries may enter into settlement discussions in particular cases if we believe it is in our best interests to do so 

  

the table below lists the number of tobaccorelated cases pending against us andor our subsidiaries or indemnitees as of february 15 2011 december 31 2009 and december 31 2008 

  

   

   

since 1995 when the first tobaccorelated litigation was filed against a pmi entity 343 2 smoking and health lights health care cost recovery and public civil actions in which we andor one of our subsidiaries andor indemnitees were a defendant have been terminated in our favor nine cases have had decisions in favor of plaintiffs five of these cases have subsequently reached final resolution in our favor one has been annulled and returned to the trial court for further proceedings and three remain on appeal to date we have paid total judgments including costs of approximately six thousand euros these payments were made in order to appeal three italian small claims cases two of which were subsequently reversed on appeal and one of which remains on appeal to date no tobaccorelated case has been finally resolved in favor of a plaintiff against us our subsidiaries or indemnitees 

   

the table below lists the verdicts and posttrial developments in the three pending cases excluding an individual case on appeal from an italian small claims court in which verdicts were returned in favor of plaintiffs

acquisitions and other business arrangements 

  

one element of our growth strategy is to strengthen our brand portfolio andor expand our geographic reach through an active program of selective acquisitions and the development of strategic business relationships we are constantly evaluating potential acquisition opportunities and strategic projects from time to time we may engage in confidential negotiations that are not publicly announced unless and until those negotiations result in a definitive agreement during 2009 2008 and 2007 we have expanded our business with the following transactions 

  

2009 

  

in september 2009 we acquired swedish match south africa proprietary limited for zar 193 billion approximately 256 million based on exchange rates prevailing at the time of the acquisition including acquired cash 

  

in july 2009 we entered into an agreement to purchase 100 of the shares of privatelyowned colombian cigarette manufacturer productora tabacalera de colombia protabaco ltda for 452 million the transaction which is subject to competition authority approval and final confirmatory due diligence is expected to close in the first half of 2010 we project this acquisition to be marginally accretive to our earnings per share immediately 

  

in february 2009 we purchased the petterøes tobacco business which includes finecut trademarks primarily sold in norway and sweden 

  

in february 2009 we also entered into an agreement with swedish match ab “swma” to establish an exclusive joint venture to commercialize swedish style snus and other smokefree tobacco products worldwide outside of scandinavia and the united states we and swma will license exclusively to the joint venture an agreed list of trademarks and intellectual property the joint venture started operations on april 1 2009 the effect of this agreement was not material to our 2009 consolidated financial position results of operations or operating cash flows 

  

2008 

  

in october 2008 we completed the acquisition of rothmans inc “rothmans” which is located in canada for cad 20 billion approximately 19 billion based on exchange rates prevailing at the time of the acquisition prior to our acquisition rothmans’ sole holding was a 60 interest in rothmans benson  hedges inc “rbh” the remaining 40 interest in rbh was owned by us 

  

in june 2008 we purchased the fine cut trademark interval and certain other trademarks in the other tobacco products category “otp” from imperial tobacco group plc for 407 million 

  

2007 

  

in november 2007 we acquired an additional 30 interest in our mexican tobacco business from grupo carso sab de cv “grupo carso” which increased our ownership interest to 80 for 11 billion after this transaction was completed grupo carso retained a 20 interest in the business a director of pmi has an affiliation with grupo carso we also entered into an agreement with grupo carso which provides the basis for us to potentially acquire or for grupo carso to potentially sell to us grupo carso’s remaining 20 interest in the future 

  

during the first quarter of 2007 we acquired an additional 582 interest in a pakistan cigarette manufacturer lakson tobacco company limited “lakson tobacco” which increased our total ownership interest in lakson tobacco from 40 to approximately 98 for 388 million 

  

other 

  

on february 25 2010 our affiliate philip morris philippines manufacturing inc “pmpmi” and fortune tobacco corporation “ftc” signed an agreement to unite their respective business activities by transferring selected assets and liabilities of pmpmi and ftc to a new company which will be called pmftc inc “pmftc” pmpmi and ftc will hold equal economic interests in pmftc while we will manage the daytoday operations of pmftc and have a majority of its board of directors consequently we will account for the contributed assets and liabilities of ftc as a business combination the preliminary purchase price allocation has not been completed and therefore we cannot describe assets acquired and liabilities assumed by each major class the establishment of pmftc permits both parties to benefit from their respective complementary brand portfolios as well as cost synergies from the resulting integration of manufacturing distribution and procurement and the further development and growth of tobacco growing in the philippines 

  

as part of the transaction ftc also received the right to sell its interest to us except in certain circumstances during the period from february 25 2015 through february 24 2018 at an agreedupon value of 117 billion which will be reflected on our consolidated balance sheet as a redeemable noncontrolling interest in future periods if the fair value of 50 of pmftc were to drop below 117 billion the difference would be treated as a special dividend to ftc and would be excluded from net earnings attributable to pmi for the calculation of earnings per share

risks related to our business and industry 

  

cigarettes are subject to substantial taxes significant increases in cigaretterelated taxes have been proposed or enacted and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted in numerous jurisdictions these tax increases may affect our profitability disproportionately and make us less competitive versus certain of our competitors 

  

tax regimes including excise taxes sales taxes and import duties can disproportionately affect the retail price of manufactured cigarettes versus other tobacco products or disproportionately affect the relative retail price of our manufactured cigarette brands versus cigarette brands manufactured by certain of our competitors because our portfolio is weighted toward the premium price manufactured cigarette category tax regimes based on sales price can place us at a competitive disadvantage in certain markets as a result our volume and profitability may be adversely affected in these markets 

  

increases in cigarette taxes are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on our sales of cigarettes due to resulting lower consumption levels a shift in sales from manufactured cigarettes to other tobacco products and from the premium price to the midprice or lowprice cigarette categories where we may be underrepresented from local sales to legal crossborder purchases of lower price products or to illicit products such as contraband and counterfeit 

  

the european commission is seeking to alter minimum retail selling price systems 

  

several eu member states have enacted laws establishing a minimum retail selling price for cigarettes and in some cases other tobacco products the european commission has commenced proceedings against these member states in the european court of justice claiming that minimum retail selling price systems infringe eu law the advocate general of the court of justice issued an advisory opinion related to the proceedings against austria france and ireland agreeing with the position of the european commission if the european commission’s infringement actions are successful they could adversely impact excise tax levels andor price gaps in those markets 

  

our business faces significant governmental action aimed at increasing regulatory requirements with the goal of preventing the use of tobacco products 

  

governmental actions combined with the diminishing social acceptance of smoking and private actions to restrict smoking have resulted in reduced industry volume in many of our markets and we expect that such actions will continue to reduce consumption levels significant regulatory developments will take place over the next few years in most of our markets driven principally by the world health organization’s framework convention on tobacco control “fctc” the fctc is the first international public health treaty on tobacco and its objective is to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation with the purpose of reducing initiation of tobacco use and encouraging cessation in addition the fctc has led to increased efforts by tobacco control advocates and public health organizations to reduce the palatability and appeal of tobacco products to adult smokers regulatory initiatives that have been proposed introduced or enacted include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

partly because of some or a combination of these measures unit sales of tobacco products in certain markets principally western europe and japan have been in general decline and we expect this trend to continue our operating income could be significantly affected by any significant decrease in demand for our products any significant increase in the cost of complying with new regulatory requirements and requirements that lead to a commoditization of tobacco products 

  

litigation related to cigarette smoking and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke “ets” could substantially reduce our profitability and could severely impair our liquidity 

  

there is litigation related to tobacco products pending in certain jurisdictions damages claimed in some of the tobaccorelated litigation are significant and in certain cases in brazil israel nigeria and 

  

canada range into the billions of dollars we anticipate that new cases will continue to be filed the fctc encourages litigation against tobacco product manufacturers it is possible that our consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation please see item 3 legal proceedings of this form 10k for a discussion of tobaccorelated litigation 

  

we face intense competition and our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations 

  

we compete primarily on the basis of product quality brand recognition brand loyalty taste innovation packaging service marketing advertising and price we are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business the competitive environment and our competitive position can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions erosion of consumer confidence competitors’ introduction of lowprice products or innovative products higher cigarette taxes higher absolute prices and larger gaps between price categories and product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate tobacco products competitors include three large international tobacco companies and several regional and local tobacco companies and in some instances governmentowned tobacco enterprises principally in china egypt thailand taiwan vietnam and algeria industry consolidation and privatizations of governmental enterprises have led to an overall increase in competitive pressures some competitors have different profit and volume objectives and some international competitors are less susceptible to changes in currency exchange rates 

  

because we have operations in numerous countries our results may be influenced by economic regulatory and political developments in many countries 

  

some of the countries in which we operate face the threat of civil unrest and can be subject to regime changes in others nationalization terrorism conflict and the threat of war may have a significant impact on the business environment economic political regulatory or other developments could disrupt our supply chain or our distribution capabilities in addition such developments could lead to loss of property or equipment that are critical to our business in certain markets and difficulty in staffing and managing our operations which could reduce our volumes revenues and net earnings in certain markets we are dependent on governmental approvals of various actions such as price changes 

  

in addition despite our high ethical standards and rigorous control and compliance procedures aimed at preventing and detecting unlawful conduct given the breadth and scope of our international operations we may not be able to detect all potential improper or unlawful conduct by our international partners and employees 

  

we may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences or to respond to consumer behavior influenced by economic downturns 

  

our tobacco business is subject to changes in consumer preferences which may be influenced by local economic conditions to be successful we must 

  

   

   

   

   

   

in periods of economic uncertainty consumers may tend to purchase lower price brands and the volume of our premium price highprice and midprice brands and our profitability could suffer accordingly 

  

we lose revenues as a result of counterfeiting contraband and crossborder purchases 

  

large quantities of counterfeit cigarettes are sold in the international market we believe that marlboro is the most heavily counterfeited international cigarette brand although we cannot quantify the amount of revenues we lose as a result of this activity in addition our revenues are reduced by contraband and legal crossborder purchases 

  

from time to time we are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters 

  

investigations include allegations of contraband shipments of cigarettes allegations of unlawful pricing activities within certain markets allegations of underpayment of custom duties andor excise taxes and allegations of false and misleading usage of descriptors such as “lights” and “ultra lights” we cannot predict the outcome of those investigations or whether additional investigations may be commenced and it is possible that our business could be materially affected by an unfavorable outcome of pending or future investigations see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsoperating results by business segmentbusiness environmentgovernmental investigations” for a description of governmental investigations to which we are subject 

  

we may be unsuccessful in our attempts to produce cigarettes with the potential to reduce the risk of smokingrelated diseases 

  

we continue to seek ways to develop commercially viable new product technologies that may reduce the risk of smoking our goal is to develop products whose potential for risk reduction can be substantiated and meet adult smokers’ taste expectations we may not succeed in these efforts if we do not succeed but one or more of our competitors do we may be at a competitive disadvantage further we cannot predict whether regulators will permit the marketing of tobacco products with claims of reduced risk to consumers which could significantly undermine the commercial viability of these products 

  

our reported results could be adversely affected by currency exchange rates and currency devaluations could impair our competitiveness 

  

we conduct our business primarily in local currency and for purposes of financial reporting the local currency results are translated into us dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period during times of a strengthening us dollar our reported net revenues and operating income will be reduced because the local currency will translate into fewer us dollars during periods of local economic crises foreign currencies may be devalued significantly against the us dollar reducing our margins actions to recover margins may result in lower volume and a weaker competitive position 

  

the repatriation of our foreign earnings changes in the earnings mix and changes in us tax laws may increase our effective tax rate 

  

because we are a us holding company our most significant source of funds will be distributions from our nonus subsidiaries under current us tax law in general we do not pay us taxes on our foreign earnings until they are repatriated to the us as distributions from our nonus subsidiaries these distributions may result in a residual us tax cost it may be advantageous to us in certain circumstances to significantly increase the amount of such distributions which could result in a 

  

material increase in our overall effective tax rate additionally the obama administration has indicated that it favors changes in us tax law that would fundamentally change how our earnings are taxed in the us if enacted and depending upon its precise terms such legislation could increase our overall effective tax rate 

  

our ability to grow may be limited by our inability to introduce new products enter new markets or to improve our margins through higher pricing and improvements in our brand and geographic mix 

  

our profitability may suffer if we are unable to introduce new products or enter new markets successfully to raise prices or maintain an acceptable proportion of our sales of higher margin products and sales in higher margin geographies 

  

we may be unable to expand our portfolio through successful acquisitions and the development of strategic business relationships 

  

one element of our growth strategy is to strengthen our brand portfolio and market positions through selective acquisitions and the development of strategic business relationships acquisition and strategic business development opportunities are limited and present risks of failing to achieve efficient and effective integration strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings there is no assurance that we will be able to acquire attractive businesses on favorable terms or that future acquisitions or strategic business developments will be accretive to earnings 

  

government mandated prices production control programs shifts in crops driven by economic conditions and adverse weather patterns may increase the cost or reduce the quality of the tobacco and other agricultural products used to manufacture our products 

  

as with other agricultural commodities the price of tobacco leaf and cloves can be influenced by imbalances in supply and demand and crop quality can be influenced by variations in weather patterns tobacco production in certain countries is subject to a variety of controls including government mandated prices and production control programs changes in the patterns of demand for agricultural products could cause farmers to plant less tobacco any significant change in tobacco leaf and clove prices quality and quantity could affect our profitability and our business 

  

our ability to implement our strategy of attracting and retaining the best global talent may be impaired by the decreasing social acceptance of cigarette smoking 

  

the tobacco industry competes for talent with consumer products and other companies that enjoy greater societal acceptance as a result we may be unable to attract and retain the best global talent 

  

we could incur significant indemnity obligations if our action or failure to act causes the spinoff to be taxable 

  

under the tax sharing agreement between altria and us we have agreed to indemnify altria and its affiliates if we take or fail to take any action where such action or failure to act precludes the spinoff from qualifying as a taxfree transaction for a discussion of these restrictions please see “the distributionus federal income tax consequences of the distribution” which is included in our registration statement on form 10 

  

your percentage ownership of our common shares may be diluted by future acquisitions 

  

to the extent we issue new shares of common stock to fund acquisitions your percentage ownership of our shares will be diluted there is no assurance that the effect of this dilution will be offset by accretive earnings from the acquisition

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend   

legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened against us andor our subsidiaries andor our indemnitees in various jurisdictions our indemnitees include distributors licensees and others that have been named as parties in certain cases and that we have agreed to defend as well as pay costs and some or all of judgments if any that may be entered against them altria group inc and pm usa are also indemnitees in certain cases pursuant to the terms of the distribution agreement between altria group inc and pmi various types of claims are raised in these proceedings including among others product liability consumer protection antitrust and tax 

  

it is possible that there could be adverse developments in pending cases against us and our subsidiaries an unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobaccorelated litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation 

  

damages claimed in some of the tobaccorelated litigation are significant and in certain cases in brazil israel nigeria and canada range into the billions of dollars the variability in pleadings in multiple jurisdictions together with the actual experience of management in litigating claims demonstrate that the monetary relief that may be specified in a lawsuit bears little relevance to the 

  

ultimate outcome much of the litigation is in its early stages and litigation is subject to uncertainty however as discussed below we have to date been largely successful in defending tobaccorelated litigation 

  

we and our subsidiaries record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated at the present time while it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur i management has concluded that it is not probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending tobaccorelated cases ii management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of any of the pending tobaccorelated cases and iii accordingly management has not provided any amounts in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes in these cases if any legal defense costs are expensed as incurred 

  

it is possible that our consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation nevertheless although litigation is subject to uncertainty we and each of our subsidiaries named as a defendant believe and each has been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases that we have valid defenses to the litigation pending against us as well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts if any all such cases are and will continue to be vigorously defended however we and our subsidiaries may enter into settlement discussions in particular cases if we believe it is in our best interests to do so 

  

the table below lists the number of tobaccorelated cases pending against us andor our subsidiaries or indemnitees as of february 15 2010 december 31 2008 and 2007 

  

   

   

   

since 1995 when the first tobaccorelated litigation was filed against a pmi entity 367 3 smoking and health lights health care cost recovery cases and public civil actions in which we andor one of our subsidiaries andor indemnitees was a defendant have been terminated in our favor nine cases have had decisions in favor of plaintiffs five of these cases have subsequently reached final resolution in our favor one has been annulled and returned to the trial court for further proceedings and three remain on appeal to date we have paid total judgments including costs of approximately six thousand 

   

euros these payments were made in order to appeal three italian small claims cases two of which were subsequently reversed on appeal and one of which remains on appeal to date no tobaccorelated case has been finally resolved in favor of a plaintiff against us our subsidiaries or indemnitees

pending claims related to tobacco products generally fall within the following categories 

  

smoking and health litigation these cases primarily allege personal injury and are brought by individual plaintiffs or on behalf of a class of individual plaintiffs plaintiffs’ allegations of liability in these cases are based on various theories of recovery including negligence gross negligence strict liability fraud misrepresentation design defect failure to warn breach of express and implied warranties violations of deceptive trade practice laws and consumer protection statutes plaintiffs in these cases seek various forms of relief including compensatory and other damages and injunctive and equitable relief defenses raised in these cases include licit activity failure to state a claim lack of defect lack of proximate cause assumption of the risk contributory negligence and statute of limitations

separation from altria group inc 

  

prior to march 28 2008 we were a whollyowned subsidiary of altria group inc “altria” on january 30 2008 the altria board of directors announced altria’s plans to spin off all of its interest in pmi to altria’s stockholders in a taxfree transaction pursuant to section 355 of the us internal revenue code the distribution of all of our shares owned by altria the “spinoff” was made on march 28 2008 the “distribution date” to stockholders of record as of the close of business on march 19 2008 the “record date” altria distributed one share of our common stock for each share of altria common stock outstanding on the record date 

  

holders of altria stock options were treated similarly to public stockholders and accordingly had their stock awards split into two instruments holders of altria stock options received the following stock options which immediately after the spinoff had an aggregate intrinsic value equal to the intrinsic value of the prespin altria options 

  

   

   

as stipulated by the employee matters agreement between pmi and altria described below the exercise price of each option was set to reflect the relative market values of pmi and altria shares by allocating the price of altria common stock before the distribution 7383 to pmi shares 5144 and altria shares 2239 and then multiplying each of these allocated values by the option conversion 

  

ratio the option conversion ratio is equal to the exercise price of the altria option prior to any adjustment for the distribution divided by 7383 as a result the new pmi option and the adjusted altria option have an aggregate intrinsic value equal to the intrinsic value of the presplit altria option 

  

holders of altria restricted stock or deferred stock awarded prior to january 30 2008 retained their existing awards and received the same number of shares of our restricted or deferred stock the restricted stock and deferred stock will not vest until the completion of the original restriction period typically three years from the date of the original grant recipients of altria deferred stock awarded on january 30 2008 who were employed by altria after the distribution date received additional shares of deferred stock of altria to preserve the intrinsic value of the award recipients of altria deferred stock awarded on january 30 2008 who were employed by us after the distribution date received substitute shares of our deferred stock to preserve the intrinsic value of the award 

  

to the extent that employees of altria and its remaining subsidiaries received our stock options altria reimbursed us in cash for the blackscholes fair value of the stock options received to the extent that our employees held altria stock options we reimbursed altria in cash for the blackscholes fair value of the stock options to the extent that employees of altria and its remaining subsidiaries received pmi deferred stock altria paid us the fair value of the pmi deferred stock less the value of projected forfeitures to the extent that our employees held altria restricted stock or deferred stock we reimbursed altria in cash for the fair value of the restricted or deferred stock less the value of projected forfeitures and any amounts previously charged to us for the restricted or deferred stock based upon the number of altria stock awards outstanding at the distribution date the net amount of these reimbursements resulted in a payment of 449 million from altria to us this reimbursement from altria is reflected as an increase to our additional paidin capital on the december 31 2008 consolidated balance sheet 

  

on march 28 2008 we entered into a transition services agreement with altria corporate services inc “alcs” a whollyowned subsidiary of altria pursuant to which alcs provided select services to us for certain transition periods not to exceed twentyfour months to ensure continuity of activity following the spinoff the transition services included among others consulting services related to risk management benefit administration and information technology as well as the transfer of transaction processing accounts payable and expense reports for certain latin american markets 

  

on march 28 2008 we entered into an employee matters agreement with altria the employee matters agreement governs pmi’s and altria’s respective obligations with respect to employees compensation and benefit plans treatment of holders of altria stock options restricted stock and deferred stock with respect to pmi and cooperation between the companies in the sharing of employee information and maintenance of confidentiality 

  

on march 28 2008 we entered into a tax sharing agreement with altria the tax sharing agreement generally governs pmi’s and altria’s respective rights responsibilities and obligations for predistribution periods and for potential taxes on the spinoff with respect to any potential taxes resulting from the spinoff responsibility for the tax will be allocated to the party that acted or failed to act in a manner which resulted in the tax 

  

effective as of january 1 2008 we entered into an intellectual property agreement with philip morris usa inc “pm usa” a whollyowned subsidiary of altria the intellectual property agreement governs the ownership of intellectual property between pmi and pm usa information about the intellectual property agreement is set forth under other matters – intellectual property  

  

the shares issued as of the distribution date equal the number of shares of altria common stock outstanding on the record date as a result on the distribution date we had 2108901789 shares of 

  

common stock outstanding the same number of shares is being used to calculate both diluted earnings per share and basic earnings per share for all periods prior to the distribution date as no pmi equity awards were outstanding prior to the distribution date

manufacturing optimization program 

  

in 2008 we terminated our contract manufacturing arrangement with pm usa we completed the process of shifting all of our pm usa contract manufactured production which approximated 57 billion cigarettes annually in 2007 to our facilities in europe during the fourth quarter of 2008 during the first quarter of 2008 we recorded exit costs of 15 million related to the termination of our manufacturing contract with pm usa the program generated pretax savings of 71 million in 2008 and is expected to provide total pretax annual savings of approximately 179 million by 2009 

  

asset impairment and exit costs 

  

since 2005 we announced plans to streamline various administrative functions and operations these plans resulted in the announced closure or partial closure of nine production facilities through december 31 2008 the largest of which is the closure of a factory in munich germany announced in 2006 as a result of these announcements and the manufacturing optimization program discussed above we recorded pretax charges of 84 million 195 million and 126 million for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively the pretax charges primarily related to severance costs the 2006 pretax charges included 57 million of costs related to the munich germany factory closure in 2007 asset impairment and exit costs also included general corporate pretax charges of 13 million related to fees associated with the spinoff cash payments related to our exit costs were 99 million 131 million and 44 million for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively future cash payments for exit costs incurred to date are expected to be approximately 115 million as of december 31 2008 the streamlining of these various functions and operations has resulted in the elimination of approximately 3600 positions these actions generated pretax cost savings beginning in 2005 with cumulative estimated annual cost savings of approximately 295 million through the end of 2008 of which 110 million were incremental savings in 2008

 item 1a risk factors tableend   

the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business our operating results our financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forwardlooking statements are made in this annual report 

  

forwardlooking and cautionary statements 

  

we may from time to time make written or oral forwardlooking statements including statements contained in filings with the sec in reports to stockholders and in press releases and investor webcasts you can identify these forwardlooking statements by use of words such as “strategy” “expects” “continues” “plans” “anticipates” “believes” “will” “estimates” “intends” “projects” “goals” “targets” and other words of similar meaning you can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 

  

we cannot guarantee that any forwardlooking statement will be realized although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions achievement of future results is subject to risks uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate actual results could vary materially from those anticipated estimated or projected investors should bear this in mind as they consider forwardlooking statements and whether to invest in or remain invested in our securities in connection with the “safe harbor” provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 we are identifying important factors that individually or in the aggregate could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements made by us any such statement is qualified by reference to the following cautionary statements we elaborate on these and other risks we face throughout this document particularly in the “business environment” sections preceding our discussion of operating results of our business you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors consequently you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties we do not undertake to update any forwardlooking statement that we may make from time to time except in the normal course of our public disclosure obligations 

  

risks related to our business and industry 

  

cigarettes are subject to substantial taxes significant increases in cigaretterelated taxes have been proposed or enacted and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted in numerous jurisdictions these tax increases may affect our profitability disproportionately and make us less competitive versus certain of our competitors 

  

tax regimes including excise taxes sales taxes and import duties can disproportionately affect the retail price of manufactured cigarettes versus other tobacco products or disproportionately affect the relative retail price of our manufactured cigarette brands versus cigarette brands manufactured by certain of our competitors because our portfolio is weighted toward the premium price manufactured cigarette category tax regimes based on sales price can place us at a competitive disadvantage in certain markets as a result our volume and profitability may be adversely affected in these markets 

  

increases in cigarette taxes are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on our sales of cigarettes due to resulting lower consumption levels a shift in sales from manufactured cigarettes to other tobacco products and from the premium price to the midprice or lowprice cigarette categories where we may be underrepresented from local sales to legal crossborder purchases of lower price products or to illicit products such as contraband and counterfeit 

  

the european commission is seeking to alter minimum retail selling price systems 

  

several eu member states have enacted laws establishing a minimum retail selling price for cigarettes and in some cases other tobacco products the european commission has commenced proceedings against these member states claiming that minimum retail selling price systems infringe eu law if the european commission’s infringement actions are successful they could adversely impact excise tax levels andor price gaps in those markets 

  

our business faces significant governmental action aimed at increasing regulatory requirements with the goal of preventing the use of tobacco products 

  

governmental actions combined with the diminishing social acceptance of smoking and private actions to restrict smoking have resulted in reduced industry volume in many of our markets and we expect that such actions will continue to reduce consumption levels significant regulatory developments will take place over the next few years in most of our markets driven principally by the world health organization’s framework convention on tobacco control “fctc” the fctc is the first international public health treaty on tobacco and its objective is to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation with the purpose of reducing initiation of tobacco use and encouraging cessation in addition the fctc has led to increased efforts by tobacco control advocates and public health organizations to reduce the palatability and appeal of tobacco products to adult smokers regulatory initiatives that have been proposed introduced or enacted include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

partly because of some or a combination of these measures unit sales of tobacco products in certain markets principally western europe and japan have been in general decline and we expect this trend to continue our operating income could be significantly affected by any significant decrease in demand for our products any significant increase in the cost of complying with new regulatory requirements and requirements that lead to a commoditization of tobacco products 

  

litigation related to cigarette smoking and exposure to ets could substantially reduce our profitability and could severely impair our liquidity 

  

there is litigation related to tobacco products pending in certain jurisdictions damages claimed in some of the tobaccorelated litigation are significant and in certain cases in brazil israel nigeria and canada range into the billions of dollars we anticipate that new cases will continue to be filed the fctc encourages litigation against tobacco product manufacturers it is possible that our consolidated 

  

results of operations cash flows or financial position could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation please see item 3 legal proceedings of this form 10k for a discussion of tobaccorelated litigation 

  

we face intense competition and our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations 

  

we compete primarily on the basis of product quality brand recognition brand loyalty service marketing advertising and price we are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business the competitive environment and our competitive position can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions erosion of consumer confidence competitors’ introduction of lowprice products or innovative products higher cigarette taxes higher absolute prices and larger gaps between price categories and product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate tobacco products competitors include three large international tobacco companies and several regional and local tobacco companies and in some instances governmentowned tobacco enterprises principally in china egypt thailand taiwan vietnam and algeria industry consolidation and privatizations of governmental enterprises have led to an overall increase in competitive pressures some competitors have different profit and volume objectives and some international competitors are less susceptible to changes in currency exchange rates 

  

because we have operations in numerous countries our results may be influenced by economic regulatory and political developments in many countries 

  

some of the countries in which we operate face the threat of civil unrest and can be subject to regime changes in others nationalization terrorism conflict and the threat of war may have a significant impact on the business environment economic political regulatory or other developments could disrupt our supply chain or our distribution capabilities in addition such developments could lead to loss of property or equipment that are critical to our business in certain markets and difficulty in staffing and managing our operations which could reduce our volumes revenues and net earnings in certain markets we are dependent on governmental approvals of various actions such as price changes 

  

in addition despite our high ethical standards and rigorous control and compliance procedures aimed at preventing and detecting unlawful conduct given the breadth and scope of our international operations we may not be able to detect all potential improper or unlawful conduct by our international partners and employees 

  

we may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences or to respond to consumer behavior influenced by economic downturns 

  

our tobacco business is subject to changes in consumer preferences which may be influenced by local economic conditions to be successful we must 

  

   

   

   

   

   

in periods of economic uncertainty consumers may tend to purchase lower price brands and the volume of our premium price high price and midprice brands and our profitability could suffer accordingly 

  

we lose revenue as a result of counterfeiting contraband and crossborder purchases 

  

large quantities of counterfeit cigarettes are sold in the international market we believe that marlboro is the most heavily counterfeited international cigarette brand although we cannot quantify the amount of revenue we lose as a result of this activity in addition our revenues are reduced by contraband and legal crossborder purchases 

  

from time to time we are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters 

  

investigations include allegations of contraband shipments of cigarettes allegations of unlawful pricing activities within certain markets and allegations of false and misleading usage of descriptors such as “lights” and “ultra lights” we cannot predict the outcome of those investigations or whether additional investigations may be commenced and it is possible that our business could be materially affected by an unfavorable outcome of pending or future investigations see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—operating results by business segment—business environment—governmental investigations” for a description of governmental investigations to which we are subject 

  

we may be unsuccessful in our attempts to produce cigarettes with the potential to reduce the risk of smokingrelated diseases 

  

we continue to seek ways to develop commercially viable new product technologies that may reduce the risk of smoking our goal is to develop products whose potential for risk reduction can be substantiated and meet adult smokers’ taste expectations we may not succeed in these efforts if we do not succeed but one or more of our competitors do we may be at a competitive disadvantage further we cannot predict whether regulators will permit the marketing of tobacco products with claims of reduced risk to consumers which could significantly undermine the commercial viability of these products 

  

our reported results could be adversely affected by currency exchange rates and currency devaluations could impair our competitiveness 

  

we conduct our business primarily in local currency and for purposes of financial reporting the local currency results are translated into us dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period during times of a strengthening us dollar our reported net revenues and operating income will be reduced because the local currency will translate into fewer us dollars during periods of local economic crises foreign currencies may be devalued significantly against the us dollar reducing our margins actions to recover margins may result in lower volume and a weaker competitive position 

  

the repatriation of our foreign earnings and change in the earnings mix may increase our effective tax rate 

  

because we are a us holding company our most significant source of funds will be distributions from our nonus subsidiaries these distributions may result in a residual us tax cost it may be advantageous to us in certain circumstances to significantly increase the amount of such distributions which could result in a material increase in our overall tax rate in the years such distributions take place 

  

our ability to grow may be limited by our inability to introduce new products enter new markets or to improve our margins through higher pricing and improvements in our brand and geographic mix 

  

our profitability may suffer if we are unable to introduce new products or enter new markets successfully to raise prices or maintain an acceptable proportion of our sales of higher margin products and sales in higher margin geographies 

  

we may be unable to expand our portfolio through successful acquisitions 

  

one element of our growth strategy is to strengthen our brand portfolio and market positions through selective acquisitions acquisition opportunities are limited and acquisitions present risks of failing to achieve efficient and effective integration strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings there is no assurance that we will be able to acquire attractive businesses on favorable terms or that future acquisitions will be accretive to earnings 

  

government mandated prices production control programs shifts in crops driven by economic conditions and adverse weather patterns may increase the cost or reduce the quality of the tobacco and other agricultural products used to manufacture our products 

  

as with other agricultural commodities the price of tobacco leaf and cloves can be influenced by imbalances in supply and demand and crop quality can be influenced by variations in weather patterns tobacco production in certain countries is subject to a variety of controls including government mandated prices and production control programs changes in the patterns of demand for agricultural products could cause farmers to plant less tobacco any significant change in tobacco leaf and clove prices quality and quantity could affect our profitability and our business 

  

our ability to implement our strategy of attracting and retaining the best global talent may be impaired by the decreasing social acceptance of cigarette smoking 

  

the tobacco industry competes for talent with consumer products and other companies that enjoy greater societal acceptance as a result we may be unable to attract and retain the best global talent 

  

we could incur significant indemnity obligations if our action or failure to act causes the distribution to be taxable 

  

under the tax sharing agreement between altria and us we have agreed to indemnify altria and its affiliates if we take or fail to take any action where such action or failure to act precludes the spinoff from qualifying as a taxfree transaction for a discussion of these restrictions please see “the distribution—us federal income tax consequences of the distribution” which is included in our registration statement on form 10 

  

your percentage ownership of our common shares may be diluted by future acquisitions 

  

one of the purposes of the spinoff was to provide us with focused common stock that can be used to fund acquisitions to the extent we issue new shares of common stock to fund acquisitions your percentage ownership of our shares will be diluted there is no assurance that the effect of this dilution will be offset by accretive earnings from the acquisition

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend   

legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened against us andor our subsidiaries andor our indemnitees in various jurisdictions our indemnitees include distributors licensees and others that have been named as parties in certain cases and that we have agreed to defend as well as pay costs and some or all of judgments if any that may be entered against them altria group inc and pm usa are also indemnitees in certain cases pursuant to the terms of the distribution agreement between altria group inc and pmi various types of claims are raised in these proceedings including among others product liability consumer protection antitrust and tax 

  

it is possible that there could be adverse developments in pending cases against us and our subsidiaries an unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobaccorelated litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation 

  

damages claimed in some of the tobaccorelated litigation are significant and in certain cases in brazil israel nigeria and canada range into the billions of dollars the variability in pleadings in multiple jurisdictions together with the actual experience of management in litigating claims demonstrate that the monetary relief that may be specified in a lawsuit bears little relevance to the ultimate outcome much of the litigation is in its early stages and litigation is subject to uncertainty however as discussed below we have to date been largely successful in defending tobaccorelated litigation 

  

we and our subsidiaries record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated at the present time while it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur i management has concluded that it is not probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending tobaccorelated cases ii management is unable to estimate the 

  

possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of any of the pending tobaccorelated cases and iii accordingly management has not provided any amounts in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes in these cases if any legal defense costs are expensed as incurred 

  

it is possible that our consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation nevertheless although litigation is subject to uncertainty we and each of our subsidiaries named as a defendant believe and each has been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases that we have valid defenses to the litigation pending against us as well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts if any all such cases are and will continue to be vigorously defended however we and our subsidiaries may enter into settlement discussions in particular cases if we believe it is in our best interests to do so 

  

the table below lists the number of tobaccorelated cases pending against us andor our subsidiaries or indemnitees as of february 15 2009 december 31 2007 and 2006 

  

   

   

since 1995 when the first tobaccorelated litigation was filed against a pmi entity approximately 297 smoking and health lights and health care cost recovery cases in which we andor one of our subsidiaries and indemnitees was a defendant have been dismissed in addition eight cases have been decided in favor of plaintiffs five of these cases have subsequently reached final resolution in our favor one has been annulled and returned to the trial court for further proceedings and two remain on appeal to date we have paid total judgments including costs of approximately six thousand euros these payments were made in order to appeal three italian small claims cases two of which were subsequently reversed on appeal and one of which remains on appeal to date no tobaccorelated case has been finally resolved in favor of a plaintiff against us our subsidiaries or indemnitees
