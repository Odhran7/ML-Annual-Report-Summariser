consumer insights research and product development process 

the markets in which we compete require constant innovation to remain competitive consumer preferences tend to drive change in our markets and as science evolves and sustainability continues to be a key factor to customers and consumers we must continue to strengthen our research and development platforms and adapt our capabilities to provide differentiated products 

consumer insights 

we believe that the first step to creating an innovative and unique product experience begins with gaining insight into the consumer and emerging industry trends by developing a deep understanding of what consumers value and prefer through our consumer insight programs we are better able to focus our research and development and creative efforts 

our consumer science insight and marketing teams interpret trends monitor product launches analyze quantitative market data and conduct numerous consumer interviews annually 

based on this information we develop innovative and proprietary programs to evaluate potential products that enable us to understand the emotional connections between a prospective product and the consumer we believe this ability to pinpoint the likelihood of a product’s success translates into stronger brand equity resulting in increased returns and greater market share gains for our customers as well as for iff 

research and development 

we consider our research and development infrastructure to be one of our key competencies and critical to our ability to provide differentiated products to our customers we have strong product and application development pipelines built upon a global network that includes research and development as well as regulatory and product stewardship capabilities 

we focus and invest substantial resources in the research and development of new and innovative molecules compounds formulations and technologies and the application of these to our customers’ products using the knowledge gained from our consumer insights programs and business unit needs we strategically focus our resources around key research and development platforms that address or anticipate consumer needs or preferences by aligning our capabilities and resources to these platforms we ensure the proper support and focus for each program so that our products can be further developed and eventually accepted for commercial application 

as of december 31 2021 we have been granted 1346 patents in the united states since 2000 and have 608 pending patent applications we have developed many unique molecules and delivery systems for our customers that are used as the foundations of successful products around the world 

our principal basic research and development activities are located in union beach new jersey wilmington delaware palo alto california brabrand denmark and leiden the netherlands at those locations our scientists and application engineers while collaborating with our other research and development centers around the world support the 

• discovery of new materials 

• development of new technologies such as delivery systems 

• creation of new compounds and 

• enhancement of existing ingredients and compounds 

as of december 31 2021 we employed approximately 3400 people globally in research and development activities 

creative application 

through our global network of creative centers and application laboratories we create or adapt the basic nourish health  biosciences scent and pharma solutions that we have developed in the research and development process to commercialize for use in our customers’ consumer products our global creative teams consist of marketing consumer science consumer insights and technical application experts from a wide range of cultures and nationalities in close partnership with our customers’ product development groups our creative teams create the experiences that our customers are seeking in order to satisfy consumer demands in each of their respective markets 

new product development is driven by a variety of sources including requests from our customers who are in need of specific products for use in a new or modified consumer product or as a result of internal initiatives stemming from our consumer insights program our product development team works in partnership with our scientists and researchers to optimize the consumer appeal and relevance of our offerings we use a collaborative process between our researchers our product development team and our customers to perfect our offerings so they are ready to be included in the final consumer product 

in addition to creating new products our researchers and product development teams advise customers on ways to improve their existing products by moderating or substituting current ingredients with more readily accessible or less expensive materials enhancing their yield this often results in creating a better value proposition for our customers 

most of our formulas are treated as trade secrets and remain our proprietary assets our business is not materially dependent upon any individual patent trademark or license 

supply chain 

we strive to provide our customers with consistent and quality products on a timely and costeffective basis by managing all aspects of the supply chain from raw material sourcing through manufacturing quality assurance regulatory compliance and distribution 

procurement 

in connection with the manufacture of our products we use natural and synthetic ingredients as of december 31 2021 we purchased approximately 28500 different raw materials sourced from an extensive network of domestic and international suppliers and distributors 

natural ingredients are derived from flowers fruits and other botanical products as well as from animal and marine products and commodity crops like wheat corn and soy they contain varying numbers of organic chemicals that are responsible for the fragrance flavor antioxidant properties and nutrition of the natural products natural products are purchased directly from farms or in processed and semiprocessed forms some natural products are used in compounds in the state in which they are obtained and others are used after further processing natural products together with various chemicals are also used as raw materials for the manufacture of synthetic ingredients by chemical processes 

in order to ensure our supply of raw materials achieve favorable pricing and provide timely transparency regarding inflationary trends to our customers we continue to focus on 

• purchasing under contract with fixed or formulabased pricing for set time periods 

• entering into hedging for raw materials we purchase that can be hedged against liquid commodity assets 

• entering into supplier relationships to gain access to supplies we would not otherwise have 

• implementing indexed pricing 

• reducing the complexity of our formulations 

• evaluating the profitability of whether to buy or make an ingredient and 

• sourcing from local countries with our own procurement professionals 

manufacturing and distribution 

as of december 31 2021 we had approximately 210 manufacturing facilities creative centers and application laboratories located in approximately 45 different countries our major manufacturing facilities are located in the united states the netherlands spain great britain germany indonesia turkey brazil mexico slovenia china india ireland finland denmark belgium and singapore 

during the last few years we undertook an initiative to optimize our global operations footprint to efficiently and costeffectively deliver value to our global customers between 2019 and 2020 the company completed the closure of 21 sites during 2021 the company completed the closure of one site by the completion of this initiative targeted for the end of 2022 we expect to close approximately 30 manufacturing sites 

our supply chain initiatives are focused on increasing capacity and investing in key technologies within our more mature markets we tend to focus on consolidation and cost optimization as well as the implementation of new technologies in addition to our own manufacturing facilities we develop relationships with third parties including contract manufacturing organizations that expand our access to the technologies capabilities and capacity that we need to better serve our customers 

for more detailed information about risks related to our supply chain please refer to item 1a “risk factors” – supply chain disruptions geopolitical developments or climatechange events may adversely affect our suppliers or our procurement of raw materials and thus may impact our business and financial results

for more detailed information about our esg programs and performance please refer to our annual sustainability report 

governmental regulation 

we develop produce and market our products in a number of jurisdictions around the world and are subject to federal regional and local legislation and regulations in various countries our products which among other industries are intended for use in food beverage pharmaceutical and dietary supplements home and personal care feed cosmetics industries are subject to strict quality and regulatory standards and environmental laws and regulations we in turn are required to meet strict standards which in recent years have become increasingly stringent and affect both existing as well as new products while the cost of compliance with such laws and regulations leads to higher overall capital expenditure which can be significant in certain periods we do not currently anticipate any material capital expenditures necessary to comply with such laws and regulations we continue to monitor existing and pending laws and regulations and while the impact of regulatory changes cannot be predicted with certainty compliance has not had and is not expected to have a material adverse effect on capital expenditure earnings or competitive position 

our products and operations are subject to regulation by governmental agencies in each of the markets in which we operate these agencies include 1 the food and drug administration and equivalent international agencies that regulate flavors pharmaceutical excipients and other ingredients in consumer products 2 the environmental protection agency and equivalent international agencies that regulate our manufacturing facilities as well as fragrance products including encapsulation systems and microbial products 3 the occupational safety and health administration and equivalent international agencies that regulate the working conditions in our manufacturing research laboratories and creative centers 4 local and international agencies that regulate trade and customs 5 the drug enforcement administration and other local or international agencies that regulate controlled chemicals that we use in our operations 6 the chemical registrationnotification authorities that regulate chemicals that we use in or transport to the various countries in which we manufacture andor market our products and 7 the us department of agriculture and equivalent international authorities with respect to among other things labeling of consumer products we have seen an increase in registration and reporting requirements concerning the use of certain chemicals in a number of countries such as registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals “reach” regulations in the european union as well as similar regulations in other countries 

in addition we are subject to various rules relating to health work safety and the environment at the local and international levels in the various countries in which we operate our manufacturing facilities throughout the world are subject to environmental standards relating to air emissions sewage discharges the use of hazardous materials waste disposal practices and cleanup of existing environmental contamination in recent years there has been an increase in the stringency of environmental regulation and enforcement of environmental standards and the costs of compliance have risen significantly a trend we expect will continue in the future 

for more detailed information about risks related to governmental regulation applicable to the company please refer to item 1a “risk factors” – if we are unable to comply with regulatory requirements and industry standards including those regarding product safety quality efficacy and environmental impact we could incur significant costs and suffer reputational harm which could adversely affect results of operations 

competition 

the markets for our products are part of a larger market that supplies a wide variety of ingredients and compounds used in consumer products the broader market includes functional foods and food additives including seasonings texturizers spices enzymes certain foodrelated commodities and fortified products as well as natural ingredients nutritional ingredients supplements and active cosmetic ingredients our recent acquisitions have also expanded our reach in products within the functional food ingredient market including ingredients focused on improving the health and wellness characteristics of a consumer good the dietary supplement pharmaceutical ingredient infant nutrition markets and the cosmetic actives market 

the global market for our products has expanded primarily as a result of an increase in demand for and an increase in the variety of consumer products 

the market for our products is highly competitive our main competitors consist of 1 other large global companies such as givaudan firmenich symrise kerry adm novozymes chr hansen 2 midsized companies 3 numerous regional and local manufacturers and 4 consumer product companies who may develop their own competing products 

we believe that our ability to create products with the sustainability related attributes customers expect and compete successfully in the various submarket is based on 

• our indepth understanding of consumers 

• vertical integration 

• innovation and technological advances from our research and development activities and as applicable our scientists 

• our ability to tailor products to customers’ needs 

• our ability to manufacture products on a global scale and 

• broadbased regulatory capabilities 

in certain industries large multinational customers and increasingly midsized customers may limit the number of their suppliers by placing some on “core lists” giving them priority for development and production of their new or modified products to compete more successfully we must make continued investments in customer relationships and tailor our research and development efforts to anticipate customers’ needs provide effective service and secure and maintain inclusion on these “core lists” 

private label manufacturers mostly mediumsized local or small food manufacturers constitute a growing segment in certain markets where we are active over the last decade with the strengthening of supermarket chains online platforms and growing consumer price consciousness consumption of private label products has grown at a faster rate than the brand food industry rate we believe that new business opportunities will continue to arise from these clients as they are increasing their demand for products that are similar to existing products in the market distinctive premium products as well as more innovative products

risk factors 

we routinely encounter and address risks in conducting our business some of these risks may cause our future results to be different  sometimes materially different  than we presently anticipate below are material risks we have identified that could adversely affect our business how we react to material future developments as well as how our competitors and customers react to those developments could also affect our future results 

risks related to our business and industry 

inflationary trends in the price of our input costs such as raw materials transportation and energy could adversely affect our business and financial results 

we have experienced and may continue to experience volatility and increases in the price of certain raw materials transportation and energy costs as a result of global market and supply chain disruptions and the broader inflationary environment 

if we are unable to increase the prices to our customers of our products to offset inflationary cost trends or if we are unable to achieve cost savings to offset such cost increases we could fail to meet our cost expectations and our profits and operating results could be adversely affected our ability to price our products competitively to timely reflect higher input costs is critical to maintain and grow our sales increases in prices of our products to customers or the impact of the broader inflationary environment on our customers and may lead to declines in demand and sales volumes further we may not be able to accurately predict the volume impact of price increases especially if our competitors are able to more successfully adjust to such input cost volatility increasing our prices to our customers could result in longterm sales declines or loss of market share if our customers find alternative suppliers or choose to reformulate their consumer products to rely less on our products which could have an adverse longterm impact on our results of operations 

supply chain disruptions geopolitical developments or climatechange events may adversely affect our suppliers or our procurement of raw materials and thus may impact our business and financial results 

in connection with our manufacturing of our products we often rely on third party suppliers for raw materials we use many different raw materials for our business such as essential oils extracts and concentrates derived from fruits vegetables flowers woods and other botanicals animal products raw fruits organic chemicals and petroleumbased chemicals as well as gelatin glycols cellulose processed grains guar locust bean gum organic vegetable oils peels saccharides seaweed soybeans and sugars and yeasts 

supply chain disruptions such as the ones related to the covid19 pandemic may impair or delay our ability to obtain sufficient quantities of certain raw materials through our ordinary supply channels and cause us to incur higher costs by procuring raw materials from other sources in order to compensate for such delays or lack of availability 

in addition our suppliers similar to us are subject to risks inherent in agriculture manufacturing and distribution on a global scale including industrial accidents environmental events climate change strikes and other labor disputes disruptions in supply chain or information systems disruption or loss of key research or manufacturing sites product quality control safety and environmental compliance issues licensing requirements and other regulatory issues as well as natural disasters global or local health crisis international conflicts terrorist acts geopolitical developments trade wars and other external factors over which neither they nor we have control these suppliers also could become insolvent or experience other financial distress for example in 2017 a fire at the manufacturing facility of basf group “basf” one of our suppliers caused them to declare a force majeure event which resulted in industry disruption due to the lack of availability of certain ingredients used in many fragrance compounds 

if our suppliers are unable to supply us with sufficient quantities of ingredients and raw materials to meet our needs we would need to seek alternative sources of such materials which may result in higher transportation or procurement costs or pursue our own production of such ingredients or direct acquisition of such raw materials however for certain of our ingredients and raw materials we rely on a limited number of suppliers where there are not readily available alternatives if we are unable to obtain or manufacture alternative sources of such ingredients or raw materials at a similar cost we may seek to i reformulate our products andor ii increase pricing to reflect the higher supply cost to mitigate our sourcing risk we maintain strategic stock levels for critical items however if we do not accurately estimate the amount of raw materials that will be used for the geographic region in which we will need these materials or competitively price our products our margins could be adversely affected 

at the same time climatechange related disruptions like the february 2021 winter storm in texas may affect the availability quality and pricing of raw materials there is growing evidence that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures weather and precipitation patterns growing and harvesting conditions both on land and in the sea and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters such as floods wildfires droughts and water scarcity to the extent such climate change effects have a negative impact on crop size and quality supply chain energy or transportation costs it could impact the availability quality and pricing of affected raw materials climate related policies and energy production restrictions and pricing may exacerbate such negative impacts 

more generally as we source many of our raw materials globally to help ensure quality control or to mitigate supply chain disruptions we are subject to additional risks related to the increases to energy or transportation costs energy prices are in turn subject to significant volatility caused by among other things market fluctuations supply and demand currency fluctuations production and transportation disruptions geopolitical developments and other world events as well as climate change related conditions discussed above for instance the russiaukraine conflict could adversely impact among other things our raw material energy and transportation costs as well as certain of our suppliers and local markets global and local macroeconomic conditions and cause further supply chain disruptions 

if we are not able to successfully mitigate such supply chain and climatechange related risks we could experience disruptions in production or increased costs which may result in decrease in our gross margin or reduced sales and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

the covid19 pandemic may materially and adversely impact our operations financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

on march 11 2020 the world health organization designated covid19 as a global pandemic since then government and local authorities including those in countries where we have manufacturing and other operations have taken various measures to contain the spread of the pandemic including the closure of nonessential businesses reduced travel the closure of retail establishments the promotion of social distancing and remote working policies where appropriate 

while increase in vaccination rates and new treatment measures have proven effective to date the covid19 pandemic remains a serious threat to the health of the worlds population and certain countries and regions continue to suffer from outbreaks or have seen a resurgence of infections especially with the emergence of new variants of the virus the continuing uncertainty related to the covid19 pandemic leads to continued volatility and risk of new government restrictions or market disruptions the scope location and timing of such restrictions or disruptions if any are difficult to predict and may materially impact our operations in the future the pandemic may also affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not expect to present significant risks 

the covid19 pandemic has subjected and may continue to subject our operations financial condition and results of operations to a number of risks including but not limited to those discussed below 

• supply chainrelated risks as a result of disruptions or uncertainty relating to the covid19 pandemic we are experiencing and may continue to experience increased costs delays or limited availability related to raw materials strain on shipping and transportation resources and higher energy prices which have negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact our margins and operating results 

• customerrelated risks we experienced and may experience in the future changes in the demand and volume for certain of our products including due to consumption or stocking behavior changes related to the covid19 pandemic for example ingredients used in products sold mainly in retail outlets such as fine fragrances or products used in retail food services experienced a decrease in demand as these outlets closed due to covid19 related restrictions we received requests for extensions in payment terms from some customers in select markets whose products experienced reduced demand while conditions have since improved any resurgence of covid19 new variants or new government measures imposed including new vaccine mandates to manage the spread of the pandemic could further exacerbate this risk 

• operationsrelated risks although our sites have restored operations to historical levels there is a risk that our operations may be affected if employees are infected at high rates or if new restrictions are reintroduced while we are following the requirements of governmental authorities and taking additional protective measures such as mandatory site guidelines and returntoworkplace protocols to ensure the safety of our workforce to the extent that employees in our manufacturing or distribution centers contract covid19 we may need to temporarily close those facilities which may result in reduced production hours inability to deliver products to our customers and reduced sales additionally compliance with vaccine mandates to the extent they are imposed in the jurisdictions in which we operate may lead to employee absences resignations or labor shortages any such mandates may also affect our suppliers which could disrupt our access to raw materials and exacerbate supplychain related risks 

although we do not currently anticipate any impairment charges related to covid19 the continuing effects of a prolonged pandemic could result in increased risk to us of asset writedowns and impairments including but not limited to property plant and equipment goodwill and other intangibles and equity investments any of these events could potentially result in a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

the integration of the nb business may continue to present significant challenges and we may not realize anticipated synergies and other benefits of the nb transaction 

the combination of large diverse and independent businesses is complex costly and timeconsuming the combination with the nb business may also result in material unanticipated problems expenses liabilities competitive responses employee turnover and loss of customer and other business relationships in addition even if the operations of the nb business are integrated successfully the full benefits of the transaction may not be realized including among others the synergies cost savings or revenue growth that are expected these benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all 

the difficulties of integration or realizing the full benefits of the nb transaction include among others 

• the diversion of management’s attention to integration matters 

• integrating operations and systems including communications systems administrative and information technology infrastructure and financial reporting and internal control systems some of which may prove to be incompatible 

• conforming standards controls procedures and accounting and other policies business cultures and compensation structures between the businesses 

• integrating employees and attracting and retaining key personnel including talent 

• retaining relationships with existing or new customers and suppliers 

• integrating and managing the expanded operations of a significantly larger and more complex company 

• liabilities that are larger than expected or potential unknown liabilities adverse consequences and unforeseen increased expenses associated with the transaction 

• restrictions until february 2023 that may limit our ability to pursue certain strategic transactions including issuing iff common stock for acquisitions and equity capital market transactions or disposing of certain businesses that would otherwise increase the value of our business if such transactions could cause certain aspects of the nb transaction and certain dupont historic transactions to fail to qualify as taxfree transactions 

• successfully exiting transitional services agreement entered into with dupont in connection with the nb transaction without impacting the continuity or quality of such services or incurring materially increased costs and 

• our ability to negotiate terms that are as favorable as those dupont had received as we replace or renew contracts following the nb transaction and the loss of the dupont brand recognition for the nb business 

the failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating the businesses and to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction could result in a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness that could materially adversely affect our financial condition 

as of december 31 2021 our total debt was 11400 billion despite our level of indebtedness we expect to continue to have the ability to borrow additional debt there may be circumstances in which required payments of principal andor interest on our debt could adversely affect our cash flows our operating results or our ability to return capital to our shareholders furthermore our degree of leverage could adversely affect our future credit ratings if we are unable to maintain or improve our current investment grade rating it could adversely affect our future cost of funding liquidity and access to capital markets in addition our current level of leverage could increase our vulnerability to sustained adverse macroeconomic weakness limit our ability to obtain further financing and our ability to pursue certain operational and strategic opportunities including large acquisitions our level of indebtedness as well as our failure to comply with covenants under our debt instruments could adversely affect our business results of operation and financial condition or our ability to return capital to our shareholders and the additional debt instruments may subject us to additional covenants 

we may not realize all the synergies and other benefits anticipated from the frutarom acquisition which could adversely affect our business 

the full benefits of the frutarom acquisition depend on the continuing realization of cost synergies through global footprint optimization across manufacturing the realization of procurement synergies organizational and operational efficiencies in overhead expenses as well as revenue growth and synergies by leveraging customer relationships across a much broader customer base and crossselling legacy iff and frutarom capabilities these benefits and the expected revenue growth may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all further additional unanticipated costs may be incurred as we continue to work towards achieving the full cost and revenue synergies if the anticipated benefits from the frutarom acquisition are not fully realized or take longer to realize than expected the value of our common stock revenues levels of expenses and results of operations may be adversely affected 

if we are unable to successfully market to our expanded and diverse customer base our operating results and future growth may be adversely affected 

as a result of our acquisition of frutarom and the nb transaction the number of our customers significantly increased and became more diverse our historical customer base was primarily comprised of large and mediumsized food beverage and consumer products companies with the completion of the nb transaction our customer base has further increased significantly and based on 2021 sales we had approximately 42000 customers approximately 59 of which are small and midsized companies this substantial increase in and diversity of our customer base has required us and may continue to require us to adjust among other things our product development manufacturing distribution marketing customer relationship and sales strategy as well as adapt corporate information technology finance and administrative infrastructures to support different gotomarket models we may experience difficulty managing the growth of a portfolio of customers that is more diverse in terms of its geographical presence as well as with respect to the types of services they require and the infrastructure required to deliver our products if we are unable to successfully gain market share or maintain our relationships with these customers our future growth could be adversely affected 

failure to successfully establish and manage acquisitions collaborations joint ventures or partnerships or the failure to close strategic transactions or divestments could adversely affect our growth 

from time to time we evaluate acquisition candidates that may strategically fit our business andor growth objectives if we are unable to successfully integrate and develop acquired businesses we could fail to achieve anticipated synergies and cost savings including any expected increase in revenues and operating results which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results furthermore even if successfully integrated the acquisition target may fail to further the company’s business strategy as anticipated expose the company to increased competition or other challenges with respect to the company’s products or geographic markets and expose the company to additional liabilities associated with the acquired business technology or other asset or arrangement we may also incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions if we fail to maintain and integrate the acquired businesses and such impairments charges would reduce our earnings 

we also evaluate and enter into collaborations joint ventures or partnerships from time to time to enhance our research and development efforts or expand our product portfolios and technology the process of establishing and maintaining collaborative relationships is difficult and timeconsuming to negotiate document and implement we may not be able to successfully negotiate such arrangements or the terms of the arrangements may not be as favorable as anticipated furthermore our ability to generate revenues from such collaborations will depend on our partners’ abilities and efforts to successfully perform the functions assigned to them in these arrangements and these collaborations may not lead to development or commercialization of products in the most efficient manner or at all in addition from time to time we have acquired and we may acquire only a majority interest in companies and provided or may provide earnouts for the former owners along with the ability at our option or obligation at the former owners’ option to purchase the minority interests at a future date at an established price these investments may have additional risks and may not be as efficient as other operations as we may have fiduciary or contractual obligations to the minority investors and may rely on former owners for the continuing operation of the acquired business if we are unable to successfully establish and manage these collaborative relationships and majority investments it could adversely affect our future growth 

in addition from time to time we may enter into other strategic transactions or we may sell or divest certain noncore assets as part of our portfolio optimization strategy such as the sale of the microbial control business which we expect will close in the second quarter of 2022 subject to customary closing conditions the failure to complete or potential delays in closing any such transaction could adversely affect the development of our portfolio optimization strategy and our future growth 

our business is highly competitive and if we are unable to compete effectively our sales and results of operations will suffer 

the markets in which we compete are highly competitive we face vigorous competition from companies throughout the world including multinational and specialized companies active in flavors fragrances enzymes pharmaceutical excipients nutrition and specialty ingredients as well as consumer product companies which may develop their own competing products for instance in the flavors industry we face increasing competition from ingredient suppliers that have expanded their portfolios to include flavor offerings some of our competitors specialize in one or more of our product subsegments while others participate in many of our product subsegments in addition some of our global competitors may have more resources than we do or may have proprietary products that could permit them to respond to changing business and economic conditions more effectively than we can consolidation of or partnerships among our competitors may exacerbate these risks 

as we continue to enter into adjacent markets such as cosmetic ingredients functional foods specialty fine ingredients and nutrition products we may face greater competitionrelated risks in these markets than with our other businesses for example the specialty fine ingredients market is more price sensitive than the flavors market and is characterized by relatively lower profit margins some fine ingredients products are less unique and more replaceable than competitors’ products there is no assurance that operating margins will remain at current levels which could substantially impact our business operating results and financial condition 

competition in our business is based among other things on innovation product quality regulatory compliance pricing quality of customer service the support provided by marketing and application groups and understanding of consumers it is difficult for us to predict the timing scale and success of our competitors’ actions in these areas in particular the discovery and development of new products protection of our intellectual property and development and retention of key employees are critical to our ability to effectively compete in our business advancement in technologies have also enhanced the ability of our competitors to develop substitutable products increased competition by existing or future competitors including aggressive price competition could result in the loss of sales reduced pricing and margin pressure and could adversely impact our sales and profitability 

failing to identify and make capital expenditures to achieve growth opportunities being unable to make new concepts scalable or failing to effectively and timely reinvest in our business operations could result in the loss of competitive position and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

our success depends on attracting and retaining talented people within our business significant shortfalls in recruitment or retention could adversely affect our ability to compete and achieve our strategic goals 

attracting developing and retaining talented employees is essential to the successful delivery of our products and has become more difficult and costly in the current labor market with historically high employee resignations furthermore as we continue to focus on innovation our need for scientists and other professionals will increase and may result in increased labor costs the ability to attract and retain talented employees is critical in the development of new products and technologies which is an integral component of our growth strategy 

competition for employees can be intense and if we are unable to successfully integrate motivate and reward the acquired frutarom employees employees from the nb business or our current employees in our combined company we may not be able to retain them if we are unable to retain these employees or attract new employees in the future our ability to effectively compete with our competitors and to grow our business could be adversely affected 

a significant portion of our sales is generated from a limited number of large multinational customers which are currently under competitive pressures that may affect the demand for our products and profitability 

during 2021 our 25 largest customers a majority of which were multinational consumer products companies collectively accounted for 29 of our sales in the aggregate large multinational customers’ market share especially in the consumer product industry continues to be pressured by new smaller companies and specialty players that cater to or are more adept at adjusting to the latest consumer trends including towards natural products and clean labels changes in the retail landscape including ecommerce and consolidation and increased competition from private labels which have resulted and may continue to result in decreased demand for our products by such multinational customers and volume erosion especially in our nourish business furthermore consolidations amongst our customers have resulted in larger and more sophisticated customers with greater buying power and additional negotiating strength if such trends continue our sales could be adversely impacted if we are not able to replace these sales 

in addition large multinational customers and increasingly middle market customers continue to utilize “core lists” of suppliers to improve margins and profitability in the flavors and fragrance segments typically these “core list suppliers are then given priority for new or modified products recently these customers are making inclusion on their “core lists” contingent upon a supplier providing more favorable terms including rebates which could adversely affect our margins we must either offer competitive costinuse solutions to secure and maintain inclusion on these “core lists” or seek to manage the relationship without being on the “corelist” if we choose not to pursue “corelist” status due to profitability concerns or if we are unable to obtain “corelist” status our ability to maintain our share of these customers’ future purchases could be adversely affected and therefore our future results of operations 

we may not successfully develop and introduce new products that meet our customers’ needs which may adversely affect our results of operations 

our ability to differentiate ourselves and deliver growth largely depends on our ability to successfully develop and introduce new products and product improvements that meet our customers’ needs and ultimately appeal to consumers innovation is a key element of our ability to develop and introduce new products we cannot be certain that we will be successful in achieving our innovation goals such as the development of new molecules new and expanded delivery systems and other technologies we currently spend approximately 5 of our sales on research and development however this investment level may vary in the future if available resources to invest in research and development are limited due to our ongoing integration and restructuring efforts our research and development investments may only generate future revenues to the extent that we are able to develop products that meet our customers’ specifications are at an acceptable cost and achieve acceptance by the targeted consumer market furthermore there may be significant lag times from the time we incur research and development costs to the time that these research and development costs may result in increased revenue 

consequently even when we “win” a project our ability to generate revenues as a result of these investments is subject to numerous customer economic and other risks that are outside of our control including delays by our customers in the launch of a new product the level of promotional support for the launch poor performance of our thirdparty vendors anticipated sales by our customers not being realized or changes in market preferences or demands or disruptive innovations by competitors 

natural disasters public health crises such as the covid19 pandemic international conflicts geopolitical events terrorist acts labor strikes political crisis accidents and other events could adversely affect our business and financial results by disrupting development manufacturing distribution or sale of our products 

as a company engaged in the global development manufacture and distribution of products we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities including industrial accidents environmental events strikes and other labor disputes product quality control issues safety licensing requirements and other regulatory issues as well as natural disasters public health crises such as pandemics or epidemics international conflicts geopolitical events terrorist acts and other external factors over which we have no control for instance the russiaukraine conflict could adversely impact among other things certain of our local markets and suppliers global and local macroeconomic conditions foreign exchange rates and financial markets raw material energy and transportation costs and cause further supply chain disruptions 

while we operate research and development manufacturing and distribution facilities throughout the world many of these facilities are extremely specialized and certain of our research and development or creative laboratories facilities are uniquely situated to support our research and development efforts while certain of our manufacturing facilities are the sole location where a specific ingredient or product is produced if our research and development activities or the manufacturing of ingredients or products were disrupted the cost of relocating or replacing these activities or reformulating these ingredients or products may be substantial which could result in production or development delays or otherwise have an adverse effect on our margins operating results and future growth 

a significant data breach or other disruption to our information technology systems could disrupt our operations result in the loss of confidential information or personal data and adversely impact our reputation business or results of operations 

we rely on information technology systems including some managed by thirdparty providers to conduct business and support our business processes including those relating to product formulas product development manufacturing sales order and invoice processing production distribution internal communications and communications with third parties throughout the world processing transactions summarizing and reporting results of operations complying with regulatory tax or legal requirements and collecting and storing customer supplier employee and other stakeholder information cybersecurity incidents data breaches and operational disruptions are constantly evolving becoming more sophisticated and are conducted by groups and individuals with a wide range of expertise and motives including foreign governments cyber terrorists cyber criminals and malicious employees and other insiders and outsiders we and our thirdparty providers are subject to risks posed by such incidents which can take many forms including code anomalies “acts of god” data leakage hardware or software failures human error cyber extortion password theft or introduction of viruses malware and ransomware including through phishing emails 

a disruption to our information technology systems could result in the loss of confidential business customer supplier or employee information litigation or fines and may require substantial investigations repairs or replacements or impact our ability to summarize and report financial results in a timely manner resulting in significant financial legal and relational costs and potentially harming our reputation and adversely impacting our operations customer service and results of operations as we work on integrating nb’s and frutarom’s systems with iff’s systems these risks may be exacerbated additionally a security or data breach could require us to devote significant management and financial resources to address the problems created and as a result of the private rights of action provided for under the eu’s general data protection regulation the “gdpr” the california consumer privacy act the “ccpa” and other laws relating to data protection and privacy in other jurisdictions in the event of such breaches additional private litigation against us may result these types of adverse impacts could also occur in the event the confidentiality integrity or availability of company customer supplier or employee information are compromised due to a data loss by us or a trusted third party we or the third parties with which we share information may not discover any such incidents and loss of information for a significant period of time after the incident occurs in addition our remote work arrangements as a result of covid19 may pose challenges for our employees and our it systems and extended periods of remote work arrangements could introduce operational risk including cybersecurity and it systems management risks 

although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and customer data and to prevent data loss and other security breaches and expect to continue to expend additional resources to bolster these protections these security measures cannot provide absolute security and we may be unable to detect or prevent a breach or disruption in the future additionally while we have insurance coverage designed to address certain aspects of cyber risks in place such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise 

we have made investments in and continue to expand our business into emerging markets which exposes us to certain risks 

as part of our growth strategy we have increased our presence in emerging markets by expanding our manufacturing presence sales organization and product offerings in these markets and we expect to continue to expand our business in these markets with our acquisition of frutarom in 2018 and the nb transaction each of which also had a significant presence in emerging markets our business in these markets has meaningfully grown in addition to the currency and international risks described below our operations in these markets may be subject to a variety of other risks emerging markets typically have a consumer base with limited or fluctuating disposable income and customer demand in these markets may fluctuate accordingly as a result decrease in customer demand in emerging markets may have an adverse effect on our ability to execute our growth strategy 

further there is no assurance that our existing products variants of our existing products or new products that we make manufacture distribute or sell will be accepted or be successful in any particular developing or emerging market due to local or global competition product price cultural differences consumer preferences or otherwise in addition emerging markets may have weak legal systems which may affect our ability to enforce our intellectual property and contractual rights exchange controls unstable governments and privatization or other government actions that may affect taxes subsidies and incentive programs and the flow of goods and currency in conducting our business we move products from one country to another and may provide services in one country from a subsidiary located in another country accordingly we are vulnerable to abrupt changes in trade customs and tax regimes in these markets if we are unable to expand our business in developing and emerging markets effectively operate or manage the risks associated with operating in these markets or achieve the return on capital we expect from our investments in these markets our operating results and future growth could be adversely affected 

the impact of currency fluctuation or devaluation in the international markets in which we operate may negatively affect our results of operations 

we have significant operations outside the us the results of which are reported in the local currency and then translated into us dollars at applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements the exchange rates between these currencies and the us dollar have fluctuated and will continue to do so in the future with the fluctuations being particularly pronounced in certain emerging markets changes in exchange rates between these local currencies and the us dollar will affect the recorded levels of sales profitability assets andor liabilities additionally volatility in currency exchange rates may adversely impact our financial condition cash flows or liquidity although we employ a variety of techniques to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations including sourcing strategies and a limited number of foreign currency hedging activities we cannot guarantee that such hedging and risk management strategies will be effective and our results of operations could be adversely affected 

international economic political legal compliance and business factors could negatively affect our financial statements operations and growth 

we operate on a global basis with manufacturing and sales facilities in or supply arrangements with companies based in the us europe africa the middle east latin america and greater asia during 2021 approximately 72 of our combined net sales were to customers outside the us and we intend to continue expansion of our international operations as a result our business is increasingly exposed to risks inherent in international operations these risks which can vary substantially by location include the following 

• governmental laws regulations and policies adopted to manage national economic and macroeconomic conditions such as increases in taxes austerity measures that may impact consumer spending monetary policies that may impact inflation rates employment regulations currency fluctuations or controls and sustainability of resources 

• changes in environmental health and safety permits or regulations such as regulations related to biodiversity or the continued implementation and evolution of the european union’s reach regulations and similar regulations that are being evaluated and adopted in other markets or the ban on microplastics proposed by european commission and the burdens and costs of our compliance with such regulations which may differ significantly across jurisdictions 

• increased product labeling and ingredient prohibitions in specific markets that may impact consumer preferences products costs andor customer acceptance 

• the imposition of or changes in customs tariffs quotas trade barriers other trade protection measures import or export licensing requirements and sanctions on trade with certain countries imposed by the us or other countries which could adversely affect our cost or ability to import raw materials or export our products to surrounding markets 

• risks and costs arising from our ability to cater to local demand and customer preferences language and cultural differences 

• changes in the laws and policies that govern foreign investment in the countries in which we operate including the risk of expropriation or nationalization the costs and ability to repatriate the profit that we generate in these countries 

• risks and costs associated with complying with antimoney laundering and counterterrorism financing laws 

• risks and costs associated with political and economic instability bribery and corruption antiamerican sentiment and social and ethnic unrest in the countries in which we operate 

• difficulty in recruiting and retaining trained local personnel 

• natural disasters global or local health crisis pandemics such as the covid19 pandemic epidemics or international conflicts including terrorist acts political crisis national and regional labor strikes in the countries in which we operate which could endanger our personnel interrupt our operations or adversely affect the demand for our products the results of certain regions or our global supply chain or 

• the risks of operating in developing or emerging markets in which there are significant uncertainties regarding the interpretation application and enforceability of laws and regulations and the enforceability of contract rights and intellectual property rights 

the occurrence of any one or more of these factors could increase our costs and adversely affect our results of operations 

economic uncertainty including increased inflation may adversely affect demand for our products which may have a negative impact on our operating results and future growth 

many of our products are ingredients in a wide assortment of global consumer products throughout the world historically demand for consumer products using our products was stimulated and broadened by changing social habits and consumer needs population growth an expanding global middleclass and general economic growth especially in emerging markets 

changes in the global regional or local economic conditions have and may in the near future adversely impact demand for consumer products at a regional or global level such parameters include but are not limited to increased inflation unemployment and underemployment salaries and wage rates stagnation and low growth rates reduced consumer spending may cause changes in our customer orders including reduced demand for our products or order cancellations the timing of placing of orders and the amounts of these orders are generally at our customers’ discretion customers may cancel reduce or postpone orders with us on relatively short notice significant cancellations reductions or delays in orders by customers could affect our quarterly results 

recently impacts of the ongoing covid19 pandemic have resulted in increased volatility and economic uncertainty and may lead to significant negative impacts on consumer spending demand for our products the ability for our customers to pay or our suppliers to supply our financial condition and the financial condition of our suppliers or customers even prior to covid19 the global economy had experienced significant recessionary pressures and declines in consumer confidence and economic growth and if those conditions emerge again or the impact of the covid19 pandemic continues our operating results and future growth may be adversely affected 

if we are unable to react in a timely and costeffective manner to changes in consumer trends such as increasing awareness of health and wellness our results of operations and future growth may be adversely affected 

we must continually anticipate and react in a timely and costeffective manner to changes in consumer preferences and demands including changes in demand driven by increasing awareness of health and wellness and demands for transparency or cleaner labels with respect to product ingredients by consumers and regulators consumers especially in developed economies such as the us and western europe are rapidly shifting away from products containing artificial ingredients to allnatural healthier alternatives in addition there has been a growing demand by consumers nongovernmental organizations and to a lesser extent governmental agencies to provide more transparency in product labeling and our customers have been taking steps to address this demand including by voluntarily providing productspecific ingredients disclosure these two trends could affect the types and volumes of our ingredients and compounds that our customers include in their consumer product offerings and therefore affect the demand for our products if we are unable to react to or anticipate these trends in a timely and costeffective manner our results of operations and future growth may be adversely affected 

we are subject to increasing customer consumer shareholder and regulatory focus on sustainability which may result in additional costs in order to meet new requirements or integrate the nb business and frutarom with our sustainability practices 

federal state local and foreign governments our customers consumers and shareholders are becoming increasingly sensitive to environmental and other sustainability issues in response we have committed to a sustainability strategy through which we continue to assess our combined environmental footprint following the nb transaction and the frutarom acquisition with the intent of identifying synergies gaps and opportunities in our sustainability efforts 

as part of our assessment so far we have been upgrading frutarom’s sustainability practices to better align them to our legacy iff practices and we are also integrating the nb business’ practices both of which may require significant costs and time to implement our assessment may reveal additional gaps between the nb business or frutarom operations on the one hand and our sustainability practices and goals on the other hand which may require significant costs to remedy 

despite our efforts the increased focus on sustainability may result in new regulations and customer requirements that could affect us these could cause us to incur additional direct costs or to make changes to our operations in order to comply with any new regulations and customer requirements we could also lose revenue if our customers divert business from us because we have not complied with their sustainability requirements or if we are not successful in integrating nb business’ and frutarom’s sustainability metrics increased shareholder activism with respect to sustainability or other governance issues or management concerns could also lead to increased costs these potential costs changes and loss of revenue could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our performance may be adversely impacted if we are not successful in managing our inventory andor working capital balances 

we evaluate our inventory balances of materials based on shelf life expected sourcing levels known uses and anticipated demand based on forecasted customer order activity and changes in our productsales mix efficient inventory management is a key component of our business success financial returns and profitability to be successful we must maintain sufficient inventory levels and an appropriate productsales mix to meet our customers’ demands without allowing those levels to increase to such an extent that the costs associated with storing and holding other inventory adversely impact our financial results if our buying decisions do not accurately predict sourcing levels customer trends or our expectations about customer needs are inaccurate we may have to take unanticipated markdowns or impairment charges to dispose of the excess or obsolete inventory which can adversely impact our financial results current supplychain related issues could also lead to raw material shortages and inventory depletion which may adversely affect our operations see “—supply chain disruptions or climatechange events may adversely affect our suppliers or our procurement of raw materials and thus may impact our business and financial results” additionally we believe excess inventory levels of raw materials with a short shelf life in our manufacturing facilities subjects us to the risk of increased inventory shrinkage if we are not successful in managing our inventory balances and shrinkage our results of and cash flows from operations may be negatively affected 

we sell certain accounts receivable on a nonrecourse basis to unrelated financial institutions under “factoring” agreements some of which are sponsored by certain customers the cost of participating in these programs was immaterial to our results in all periods should we choose not to participate or if these programs were no longer available it could reduce our cash flows from operations in the period in which the arrangement ends 

any impairment of our tangible or intangible longlived assets including goodwill may adversely impact our profitability 

a significant portion of our assets consists of longlived assets including tangible assets such as our manufacturing facilities and intangible assets including goodwill and customer relationships 

as a result of our recent acquisitions including the acquisition of frutarom and the nb transaction as of december 31 2021 we had recorded approximately 26920 billion of intangible assets and goodwill including 4289 billion of goodwill associated with the acquisition of frutarom and 11817 billion of goodwill associated with the merger with the nb business our results of operations and financial position in future periods could be negatively impacted should future impairments of our longlived assets including intangible assets or goodwill occur 

at least annually we assess both goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment we test for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value we record an impairment charge based on the difference of the two intangible assets with finite lives are also tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable such events and changes in circumstances could include a sustained decrease in our market capitalization increased competition or unexpected loss of market share increased input costs beyond projections for example due to regulatory or industry changes our inability to recognize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions unexpected business disruptions for example due to a natural disaster public health crises such as pandemics or epidemics or loss of a customer supplier or other significant business relationship acts by governments and courts operating results falling short of projections or significant adverse changes in the markets in which we operate 

fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions estimates and market factors estimating the fair value of reporting units requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our business performance future plans future annual net cash flows income tax considerations discount rates growth rates and based on industry economic regulatory conditions and other market factors moreover management will make significant accounting judgments and estimates for the application of acquisition accounting under gaap and the underlying valuation models iff’s business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted in future periods if iff’s accounting judgments and estimates related to these models prove to be inaccurate 

to the extent any of our acquisitions including the acquisitions of frutarom and the nb business do not perform as anticipated and our underlying assumptions and estimates related to their fair value determination are not met whether due to internal or external factors the value of such assets may be negatively affected and we may be required to record impairment charges 

our funding obligations for our pension and postretirement plans could adversely affect our earnings and cash flows 

the funding obligations for our pension plans are impacted by the performance of the financial markets particularly the equity markets and interest rates funding obligations are determined under government regulations and are measured each year based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date if the financial markets do not provide the longterm returns that are expected under the governmental funding calculations we could be required to make larger contributions the equity markets can be very volatile and therefore our estimate of future contribution requirements can change dramatically in relatively short periods of time similarly changes in interest rates and legislation enacted by governmental authorities can impact the timing and amounts of contribution requirements an adverse change in the funded status of the plans could significantly increase our required contributions in the future and adversely impact our liquidity 

assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans are determined by us in consultation with outside consultants and advisors in the event that we determine that changes are warranted in the assumptions used such as the discount rate expected longterm rate of return on assets or expected health care costs our future pension and postretirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease due to changing market conditions or changes in the participant population the assumptions that we use may differ from actual results which could have a significant impact on our pension and postretirement liabilities and related costs and funding requirements 

the expected phase out of the london interbank office rate “libor” could impact the interest rates paid on our variable rate indebtedness and cause our interest expense to increase 

in 2017 the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority the “fca” which regulates libor announced that it intends to phase out libor by the end of 2021 it was unclear at that time whether or not libor would cease to exist if new methods of calculating libor would be established such that it continues to exist after 2021 or if replacement conventions would be developed in march 2021 the fca confirmed that publication of all of the libor settings for euro sterling and swiss franc and some of the libor settings for japanese yen and us dollars ceased in december 2021 and the remainder of the libor settings for us dollars will cease in june 2023 to identify a successor rate for libor financial regulators in various countries including the united states the united kingdom the european union and switzerland have formed working groups with the aim of recommending alternatives to libor denominated in their local currencies some of the financial regulators have identified the secured overnight financing rate “sofr” as their preferred alternative rate for libor 

sofr is observed and backwardlooking which stands in contrast with libor under the current methodology which is an estimated forwardlooking rate and relies to some degree on the expert judgment of submitting panel members given that sofr is a secured rate backed by government securities it will be a rate that does not take into account bank credit risk as is the case with libor whether or not sofr attains market traction as a libor replacement tool remains in question although certain financial regulators have indicated their preference for sofr as the preferred replacement rate for libor it is unclear if other benchmarks may emerge or if other rates will be adopted as such the future of libor is uncertain 

even if the financial instruments transition to using alternative benchmarks like sofr successfully the new benchmarks are likely to differ from libor as the alternative benchmark rate may be calculated differently borrowings under our revolving credit and term loan facilities are at variable interest rates based on libor although our revolving credit and term loan facilities include mechanics to facilitate the adoption by us and our lenders of an alternative benchmark rate in place of libor no assurance can be made that such alternative rate will perform in a manner similar to libor and may result in interest rates that are higher or lower than those that would have resulted had libor remained in effect further transitioning to an alternative benchmark rate such as sofr may result in us incurring expense and legal risks as renegotiation and changes to documentation may be required in effecting the transition any of these occurrences could materially and adversely affect our borrowing costs financial condition and results of operations 

our business may be negatively impacted as a result of the united kingdom’s departure from the european union 

we currently manufacture goods in the united kingdom for distribution in the european union and viceversa and therefore may be adversely affected as a result of the united kingdom’s departure from the european union “brexit” in 2020 the impact of the withdrawal has and may continue to among other outcomes exacerbate the disruption of the free movement of goods services and people between the united kingdom and the european union undermine bilateral cooperation in key geographic areas and significantly disrupt trade between the united kingdom and the european union or other nations as the united kingdom pursues independent trade relations in addition brexit has and continues to cause legal uncertainty which could last indefinitely and may potentially create divergent national laws and regulations as the united kingdom determines which european union laws to replace or replicate given the lack of comparable precedent it is unclear what the financial trade and legal implications of the withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union will be and how the withdrawal will continue to affect us adverse consequences concerning brexit or the european union could include deterioration in global economic conditions instability in global financial markets political uncertainty volatility in currency exchange rates or adverse changes in the crossborder agreements currently in place any of which could have an adverse impact on our financial results in the future 

risks related to legal and regulatory considerations 

if we are unable to comply with regulatory requirements and industry standards including those regarding product safety quality efficacy and environmental impact we could incur significant costs and suffer reputational harm which could adversely affect results of operations 

the development manufacture and sale of our products are subject to various regulatory requirements in each of the countries in which our products are developed manufactured and sold in addition we are subject to product safety and compliance requirements established by governments nongovernmental organizations including industry or similar oversight bodies or contractually by our customers including requirements concerning product safety quality and efficacy environmental impacts including packaging energy and water use and waste management and other sustainability or similar issues changes to regulations or the implementation of additional regulations especially in certain highly regulated markets we are active in such as regulatory modernization of food safety laws and evolving standards and regulations affecting pharmaceutical excipients microbials or in reaction to new or nextgeneration technologies including advances in protein engineering gene editing and gene mapping or novel uses of existing technologies has required and may in the future require us to reduce or remove certain ingredients substances or processing aids from the product portfolio and may result in significant costs or capital expenditures or require changes in business practice that could result in reduced margins or profitability 

we use a variety of strategies methodologies and tools to minimize the likelihood of product or process noncompliance with these regulations and standards by i monitoring regulatory developments and current product standards ii assessing relative risks in our supply chain iii monitoring internal and external performance and iv testing raw materials and finished goods as concerns regarding safety quality and environmental impact become more pressing we may see new more restrictive regulations adopted that impact our products for example the european chemicals agency has proposed that the european commission adopt a ban on microplastics including those found in personal care items detergents and cosmetics to reduce plastics pollution if this ban is adopted we will be required to modify our products andor innovate new solutions to replace microplastics in our products if we are unable to adapt to these new regulations or standards in a cost effective and timely manner we may lose business to competitors who are able to provide compliant products expose ourselves to customer claims regulatory fines litigation or reputational damage 

gaps in our operational processes or those of our suppliers or distributors can result in products that do not meet our quality control or industry standards or fail to comply with the relevant regulatory requirements which in turn can result in finished consumer goods that do not comply with applicable standards and requirements products that are mislabeled contaminated or damaged could result in a regulatory noncompliance event or even a product recall by the fda or a similar foreign agency for instance the company determined that certain grades of microcrystalline cellulose avicel® ph 101 102 and 200 nf and avicel® rc591 nf were found to be outofspecification collectively “oos avicel® nf” although the company does not expect this issue to affect the functionality of avicel® nf grades or to pose a human health hazard corrective actions have been implemented to improve operational and laboratory conditions 

we may also be exposed to serious adverse health claims related to undetected poor quality of raw materials internal system failures to adequately reduce or eliminate certain hazards such as pathogens allergens contaminants pesticides physical hazards etc or products that are not in line with required or agreed specifications supply chain complexities aging equipment and infrastructure human errors or other failures may exacerbate such risks 

our contracts often require us to indemnify our customers for the costs associated with a product noncompliance event including penalties costs and settlements arising from litigation remediation costs or loss of sales as our offerings are used in many products intended for human use or consumption these consequences would be exacerbated if we or our customer did not identify the defect before the product reaches the consumer and there was a resulting impact at the consumer level such a result could lead to potentially largescale adverse publicity negative effects on consumer’s health recalls and potential litigation fines penalties sanctions or other regulatory actions in addition if we do not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification from suppliers or other third parties or if insurance or indemnification is not available the liability relating to product or possible thirdparty claims arising from mislabeled contaminated or damaged products could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations furthermore adverse publicity about our products or our customers’ products that contain our ingredients including concerns about product safety or similar issues whether real or perceived could harm our reputation and result in an immediate adverse effect on our sales and customer relationships as well as require us to utilize significant resources to rebuild our reputation 

defects quality issues including product recalls inadequate disclosure or misuse with respect to the products and capabilities could adversely affect our business reputation and results of operations 

defects in misuse of quality issues with respect to including products recalls or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to our products could lead to lost profits and other economic damage property damage personal injury or other liability resulting in thirdparty claims criminal liability significant costs damage to our reputation and loss of business any of these factors could adversely affect our business financial condition and our results of operations 

our results of operations may be negatively impacted by the outcome of uncertainties related to litigation 

from time to time we are involved in a number of legal claims regulatory investigations and litigation including claims related to intellectual property product liability environmental matters and indirect taxes for instance product liability claims may arise due to the fact that we supply products to the food and beverage functional food pharmanutraceutical and personal care industries our manufacturing and other facilities may expose us to environmental claims and regulatory investigations and potential fines 

in addition in light of our product offerings into functional food nutraceuticals and natural antioxidants we may also be subject to claims of false or deceptive advertising claims relating to the efficacy health benefits or other performance attributes of such offerings in the us europe and other foreign jurisdictions in which we offer these types of products these claims can arise as a result of function claims health claims nutrient content claims and other claims that impermissibly suggest such benefits or attributes for certain foods or food components the cost of defending these claims or our obligations for direct damages and indemnification if we were found liable could adversely affect our results of operations 

as a result of the nb transaction and the frutarom acquisition we assumed legal or environmental claims regulatory investigations and litigation including product liability patent infringement commercial litigation and other actions and we may become involved in additional actions in the future arising from the acquired operations specifically as the nb business and frutarom had a significant number of facilities located globally and a large number of customers our exposure to legal claims regulatory and environmental investigations and litigation may increase this could result in an increase in our cost for defense or settlement of claims or indemnification obligations if we were to be found liable in excess of our historical experience 

in addition we are also the subject of a putative shareholder class action lawsuit filed in august 2019 after we disclosed that preliminary results of investigations indicated that frutarom businesses operating principally in russia and ukraine had made improper payments to representatives of customers 

our insurance may not be adequate to protect us from all material expenses related to pending and future claims and our current levels of insurance may not be available in the future at commercially reasonable prices any of these factors could adversely affect our profitability and results of operations 

failure to comply with environmental protection laws may cause us to close relocate or operate one or more of our plants at reduced production levels and expose us to civil or criminal liability which could adversely affect our operating results and future growth 

our business operations and properties procure make use of manufacture sell and distribute substances that are sometimes considered hazardous and are therefore subject to extensive and increasingly stringent federal state local and foreign laws and regulations pertaining to protection of the environment including air emissions sewage discharges the use of hazardous materials waste disposal practices and cleanup of existing environmental contamination 

failure to comply with these laws and regulations or any future changes to them may result in significant consequences to us including the need to close or relocate one or more of our production facilities administrative civil and criminal penalties fines sanctions litigation costly remediation measures liability for damages and negative publicity if we are unable to meet production requirements we can lose customer orders which can adversely affect our future growth or we may be required to make incremental capital investments to ensure supply for example we have completed negotiations with the chinese government concerning the relocation of a second fragrance facility in china idling of facilities or production modifications has caused or may cause customers to seek alternate suppliers due to concerns regarding supply interruptions and these customers may not return or may order at reduced levels even once issues are remediated if these noncompliance issues reoccur in china or occur or in any other jurisdiction we may lose business and may be required to incur capital spending above previous expectations close a plant or operate a plant at significantly reduced production levels on a permanent basis and our operating results and cash flows from operations may be adversely affected 

we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act or similar us or foreign antibribery and anticorruption laws and regulations or applicable sanctions laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate 

the global nature of our business our increased size and employee count the significance of our international revenue our focus on emerging markets and presence in regulated industries create various domestic and local regulatory challenges and subject us to risks associated with our international operations the us foreign corrupt practices act or fcpa and similar antibribery and anticorruption laws and regulations in other countries generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or for other commercial advantage in addition us public companies are required to maintain records that accurately and fairly represent their transactions and have an adequate system of internal accounting controls under the fcpa us companies may be held liable for the corrupt actions taken by directors officers employees agents or other strategic or local partners or representatives as such if we or our intermediaries fail to comply with the requirements of the fcpa or similar legislation governmental authorities in the us and elsewhere could seek to impose substantial civil andor criminal fines and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation operating results and financial condition 

we operate or may pursue opportunities in some jurisdictions such as china india brazil russia and africa that pose potentially elevated risks of fraud or corruption or increased risk of internal control issues in certain jurisdictions compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices from time to time we have conducted and will conduct internal investigations of the relevant facts and circumstances control testing and compliance reviews and take remedial actions when appropriate to help ensure that we are in compliance with applicable corruption and similar laws and regulations for example in august 2019 during the integration of frutarom we were made aware of allegations that two frutarom businesses operating principally in russia and ukraine made certain improper payments including to representatives of a number of customers our investigation substantiated the allegations that improper payments to representatives of customers were made and that key members of frutarom’s senior management at the time were aware of such payments we did not uncover any evidence suggesting that such payments had any connection to the us in addition frutarom grew through rapid acquisition and as part of our integration efforts we have implemented our anticorruption and similar policies throughout a number of those acquired companies many of which were not previously subject to these us laws 

given the international scope of our business we also sell certain of our products to countries that are subject to us and other sanctions under general authorizations regarding such products compliance with sanctions laws is highly technical and requires careful oversight and it is possible that actions taken by us our subsidiaries or our suppliers may cause us to be in breach with these laws which could have a material adverse effect to our business detecting investigating and resolving actual or alleged violations of the fcpa or other antibribery and anticorruption laws and regulations is expensive could consume significant time and attention of our senior management and could subject us to investigations and inquiries by governmental and other regulatory bodies any allegations of noncompliance with such laws and regulations could have a disruptive effect on our operations in such jurisdiction including interruptions of business or loss of thirdparty relationships which may negatively impact our results of operations or financial condition any determination that our operations or activities are not in compliance with such laws and regulations could expose us to severe criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions significant fines termination of necessary licenses and permits and penalties or other sanctions that may harm our business and reputation 

our ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights 

we rely on patents trademarks copyrights and trade secrets to protect our intellectual property rights we often rely on trade secrets to protect our products manufacturing processes extract methodologies and other processes as this does not require us to publicly file information regarding our intellectual property from time to time a third party may claim that we have infringed upon or misappropriated their intellectual property rights or a third party may infringe upon or misappropriate our intellectual property rights we could incur significant costs in connection with legal actions to assert our intellectual property rights against third parties or to defend ourselves from thirdparty assertions of invalidity infringement misappropriation or other claims any settlement or adverse judgment resulting from such litigation could require us to obtain a license to continue to use the intellectual property rights that are the subject of the claim or otherwise restrict or prohibit our use of such intellectual property rights any required licensing fees may not be available to us on acceptable terms if at all for those intellectual property rights that are protected as trade secrets this litigation could result in even higher costs and potentially the loss of certain rights since we would not have a perfected intellectual property right that precludes others from making using or selling our products or processes the ongoing trend among our customers towards more transparent labeling could further diminish our ability to effectively protect our products 

we vigilantly protect our intellectual property rights including trade secrets we have designed and implemented internal controls intended to restrict access to and distribution of our respective intellectual property despite these precautions our intellectual property is vulnerable to unauthorized access through employee error or actions theft and cybersecurity incidents and other security breaches protecting intellectual property related to biotechnology is particularly challenging because theft is difficult to detect and biotechnology can be selfreplicating accordingly the impact of such theft can be significant 

for intellectual property rights that we seek to protect through patents we cannot be certain that these rights if obtained will not later be opposed invalidated or circumvented in addition even if such rights are obtained in the us the laws of some of the other countries in which our products are or may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us if other parties were to infringe on our intellectual property rights or if our intellectual property rights were the subject of unauthorized access leading to competitive pressure or if a third party successfully asserted that we had infringed on their intellectual property rights it could materially and adversely affect our future results of operations by among other things i being required to cease production and marketing or reducing the price that we could obtain in the marketplace for products which are based on such rights ii increasing the royalty or other fees that we may be required to pay in connection with such rights iii limiting the volume if any of such products that we can sell or iv resulting in significant litigation costs and potential liability 

changes in our tax rates the adoption of new us or international tax legislation or changes in existing tax laws could expose us to additional tax liabilities that may affect our future results 

we are subject to taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in liabilities for uncertain tax positions cost of repatriations or changes in tax laws or their interpretation any of these changes could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 

we have and will continue to implement transfer pricing policies among our various operations located in different countries these transfer pricing policies are a significant component of the management and compliance of our operations across international boundaries and overall financial results many countries routinely examine transfer pricing policies of taxpayers subject to their jurisdiction challenge transfer pricing policies aggressively where there is potential noncompliance and impose significant interest charges and penalties where noncompliance is determined however governmental authorities could challenge these policies more aggressively in the future and if challenged we may not prevail we could suffer significant costs related to one or more challenges to our transfer pricing policies 

we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service state tax authorities and foreign tax authorities in those countries in which we operate and we may be subject to assessments or audits in the future in any of the countries in which we operate the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals and while we do not believe the results that follow would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition such results could have a material effect on our income tax provision net income or cash flows in the period or periods in which that determination is made 

in addition a number of international legislative and regulatory bodies have proposed legislation and begun investigations of the tax practices of multinational companies and in the european union the tax policies of certain european union member states one of these efforts has been led by the organization for economic cooperation and development an international association of 34 countries including the us which has finalized recommendations to revise corporate tax transfer pricing and tax treaty provisions in member countries since 2013 the european commission “ec” has been investigating tax rulings granted by tax authorities in a number of european union member states with respect to specific multinational corporations to determine whether such rulings comply with european union rules on state aid as well as more recent investigations of the tax regimes of certain european union member states under european union law selective tax advantages for particular taxpayers that are not sufficiently grounded in economic realities may constitute impermissible state aid if the ec determines that a tax ruling or tax regime violates the state aid restrictions the tax authorities of the affected european union member state may be required to collect back taxes for the period of time covered by the ruling in late 2015 and early 2016 the ec declared that tax rulings related to other companies by tax authorities in luxembourg the netherlands and belgium did not comply with the european union state aid restrictions if the ec or tax authorities in other jurisdictions were to successfully challenge tax rulings applicable to us in any of the member states in which we are subject to taxation or our internal intercompany arrangements we could be exposed to increased tax liabilities 

in december 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” that significantly revised the us tax code effective january 1 2018 by among other things lowering the corporate income tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35 to a flat 21 limiting deductibility of interest expense and performance based incentive compensation transitioning to a territorial system and creating new taxes associated with global operations the tax act impacted our consolidated results of operations during 2021 and is expected to continue to impact our consolidated results of operations in future periods in future periods we expect that our effective tax rate will be impacted by the lower us corporate tax rate that will initially be offset by the elimination of the deductibility of performancebased incentive compensation and other provisions of the tax act that may impact us prospectively however the ultimate impact of the tax act will depend on additional regulatory or accounting guidance that may be issued with respect to the tax act and any operating and structural changes that we may undertake to permit us to benefit from the new lower us tax rate prospectively this could adversely affect our results of operations 

the nb transaction could result in significant tax liability and we may be obligated to indemnify dupont for any such tax liability imposed on dupont 

the completion of the nb transaction was conditioned upon the receipt by dupont of an opinion that the transaction generally will qualify as a taxfree reorganization the tax opinion was based upon various factual representations and assumptions as well as certain undertakings made by dupont iff and nb if any of those factual representations or assumptions were untrue or incomplete in any material respect any undertaking was or is not complied with or the facts upon which the opinion was based are materially different from the facts at the closing of the nb transaction the transaction may not qualify in whole or part for taxfree treatment 

the nb spinoff and certain aspects of the prespinoff internal reorganizations to form nb could be taxable to dupont if nb or we were to engage in a “spinco tainting act” as defined in the tax matters agreement by and among dupont nb and iff a form of which is attached to iff’s registration statement on form s4 registration number 333238072 a spinco tainting act is generally any action or inaction within our control or under the control of nb or their affiliates any event involving our common stock or the common stock of nb or any assets of nb or its subsidiaries or any breach by nb or any of its subsidiaries of any factual representations assumptions or undertakings made by it in each case that would affect the nonrecognition treatment of the spinoff and internal reorganizations for us federal income tax purposes as described above under the tax matters agreement we and nb will be required to indemnify dupont for any taxes resulting from a spinco tainting act if we or nb were required to indemnify dupont pursuant to the tax matters agreement as described above this indemnification obligation may be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on us including with respect to its financial condition and results of operations 

if we fail to comply with data protection laws in the us and abroad we may be subject to fines penalties and other costs 

legal requirements relating to the collection storage handling use disclosure transfer and security of personal data continue to evolve and regulatory scrutiny in this area is increasing around the world this regulatory environment is increasingly challenging and may present material obligations and risks to our business including significantly expanded compliance burdens restrictions on transfer of personal data costs and enforcement risks for example the european union’s gdpr which became effective in may 2018 greatly increases the jurisdictional reach of eu law and adds a broad array of requirements related to personal data including individual notice and optout preferences restrictions on and requirements for transfer of personal data and the public disclosure of significant data breaches additionally violations of the gdpr can result in fines of as much as 4 of a company’s annual revenue other governments have enacted or are enacting similar data protection laws including data localization laws that require data to stay within their borders all of these evolving compliance and operational requirements restrictions on use of personal data as well as the uncertain interpretation and enforcement of laws impose significant costs and regulatory risks that are likely to increase over time our failure to comply with these evolving regulations could expose us to fines sanctions penalties and other costs that could harm our reputation and adversely impact our financial results

financial measures — currency neutral 

our financial results include the impact of foreign currency exchange rates we provide currency neutral calculations in this report to remove the impact of these items beginning in the first quarter 2021 we elected to change the method in which we calculate currency neutral numbers to now be calculated by translating current year invoiced sale amounts at the exchange rates used for the corresponding prior year period previously we calculated currency neutral numbers by comparing current year results to the prior year results restated at exchange rates in effect for the current year based on the currency of the underlying transaction we use currency neutral results in our analysis of subsidiary or segment performance we also use currency neutral numbers when analyzing our performance against our competitors and believe the change in method better allows us to do so 

due to the merger with nb for the fiscal year 2021 we will not be presenting currency neutral impacts for the nourish health  biosciences and pharma solutions operating segments as the performance in these operating segments includes effects of nb in 2021 while the 2020 period does not and thus the period ’ s results are not comparable we present the currency neutral impacts for the scent operating segment as this operating segment does not have any effects of nb 

impact of covid19 pandemic 

on march 11 2020 the world health organization designated covid19 as a global pandemic various policies and initiatives have been implemented around the world to reduce the global transmission of covid19 although there continue to be minor operational disruptions all of iff’s manufacturing facilities remain open and continue to manufacture products 

the covid19 pandemic remains a serious threat to the health of the world’s population and certain countries and regions continue to suffer from outbreaks or have seen a recurrence of infections especially with the emergence of new variants of the virus accordingly the company continues to take the threat from covid19 seriously the impact that covid19 will have on our consolidated results of operations for the remainder of 2022 remains uncertain due to the length and severity of covid19 there is continued volatility as a result of retail and travel consumer shopping and consumption behavior moreover as a result of disruptions or uncertainty relating to the covid19 pandemic we are experiencing and may continue to experience increased costs delays or limited availability related to raw materials strain on shipping and transportation resources and higher energy prices which have negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact our margins and operating results we will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of these potential impacts to our business consolidated results of operations segment results liquidity and capital resources 

although iff has not experienced and does not currently anticipate any impairment charges related to covid19 the continuing effects of a prolonged pandemic could result in increased risk of asset writedowns and impairments any of these events could potentially result in a material adverse impact on iff’s business and results of operations 

for more detailed information about risks related to covid19 refer to item 1a “risk factors”  the covid19 pandemic may materially and adversely impact our operations financial condition results of operations and cash flows

segment adjusted operating ebitda results by business unit 

effective in the first quarter of 2021 management elected to change the profit or loss measure of the companys reportable segments from segment operating profit to segment adjusted operating ebitda for internal reporting and performance measurement purposes segment adjusted operating ebitda is defined as income before taxes before depreciation and amortization expense interest expense restructuring and other charges and certain nonrecurring items prior period amounts have been recast to reflect these changes in segment profitability measures our determination of reportable segments was made on the basis of our strategic priorities within each segment and corresponds to the manner in which our chief operating decision maker reviews and evaluates operating performance to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment in addition to our strategic priorities segment reporting is also based on differences in the products and services we provide as a result we added two new reportable segments  health  biosciences and pharma solutions nourish is composed of most of iff’s legacy taste division and nb’s food  beverage division the scent and health  biosciences segments include a component of the legacy taste segment 



nourish segment adjusted operating ebitda 

nourish segment adjusted operating ebitda increased 573 million to 1172 billion 187 of segment sales in 2021 from 599 million 208 of segment sales in the comparable 2020 period the increase primarily reflected the inclusion of nb along with volume increases in the operating segment the decrease in segment adjusted operating ebitda margin as a percentage of sales was due to the difference in product portfolio mix of the new nourish operating segment as a result of the merger with nb compared to the legacy taste operating segment and higher input costs

2020 in comparison to 2019 

for a comparison of our results of operations for the fiscal years ended december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 see “part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of our form 10k for the fiscal year ended december 31 2020 filed with the sec on february 22 2021 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash and cash equivalents 

we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 711 million at december 31 2021 compared to 650 million at december 31 2020 and of this balance a portion was held outside the united states cash balances held in foreign jurisdictions are in most circumstances available to be repatriated to the united states 

in connection with the merger with nb the companys cash balance increased by approximately 246 million which included the cash acquired of 193 million and approximately 53 million related to the special cash payment made in accordance with the merger agreement 

effective utilization of the cash generated by our international operations is a critical component of our strategy we regularly repatriate cash from our nonus subsidiaries to fund financial obligations in the us as we repatriate these funds to the us we will be required to pay income taxes in certain us states and applicable foreign withholding taxes during the period when such repatriation occurs accordingly as of december 31 2021 we have a deferred tax liability of approximately 81 million for the effect of repatriating the funds to the us 

restricted cash 

at december 31 2021 we had a balance of 5 million of which 4 million is included in current assets and 1 million is included in other assets compared to 10 million at december 31 2020 

cash flows provided by operating activities 

cash flows provided by operations in 2021 were 1437 billion or 123 of sales compared to 714 million or 140 of sales in 2020 and 699 million in 2019 the increase in cash provided by operating activities from 2020 to 2021 was primarily driven by higher cash earnings excluding the impact of depreciation and amortization and amortization of nb inventory stepup costs and changes related to accounts payable inventories and accounts receivable the increase in cash provided by operating activities from 2019 to 2020 was primarily driven by changes related to accounts receivable inventories incentive compensation and accrued expenses largely offset by lower cash earnings in 2020 

working capital current assets less current liabilities totaled 3354 billion at yearend 2021 compared to 1156 billion at yearend 2020 the increase in working capital was due to the merger with nb 

we have various factoring agreements in the us and the netherlands under which we can factor up to approximately 250 million in receivables with a financial institution additionally we maintain factoring programs that are sponsored by certain customers under all of the arrangements we sell the receivables on a nonrecourse basis to unrelated financial institutions and account for the transactions as a sale of receivables the applicable receivables are removed from our consolidated balance sheets when the cash proceeds are received 

the impact on cash provided by operations from participating in these programs increased approximately 19 million 43 million and 38 million in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively compared to each respective prior year period the cost of participating in these programs was approximately 6 million 4 million and 7 million in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively see note 1 for additional information 

cash flows provided by used in investing activities 

cash flows used in investing activities in 2021 were 18 million compared to 187 million and 226 million in 2020 and 2019 respectively the decrease in cash used in investing activities from 2020 to 2021 was primarily driven by the increase in cash provided by the merger with nb and higher net proceeds received from the sale of the fruit preparation business largely offset by higher spending on property plant and equipment in the current year the decrease in cash used in investing activities from 2019 to 2020 was primarily driven by lower payments for acquisitions and lower spending on property plant and equipment partially offset by lower proceeds from disposal of assets in 2020 and cash paid on settlement of derivative instruments in 2020 versus proceeds in 2019 

additions to property plant and equipment were 393 million 192 million and 236 million in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively net of grants and other reimbursements from government authorities these investments largely arise from our ongoing focus to align our manufacturing facilities with customer demand primarily in emerging markets and new technology consistent with our strategy 

we have evaluated and reprioritized our capital projects and expect that capital spending in 2022 will be approximately 50 of sales net of potential grants and other reimbursements from government authorities 

cash flows used in financing activities 

cash flows used in financing activities in 2021 were 1304 billion compared to 512 million and 505 million in 2020 and 2019 respectively the increase in cash used in financing activities from 2020 to 2021 was primarily driven by higher repayments of both shortterm and longterm debt and higher cash dividend payments partially offset by proceeds from issuance of commercial paper the increase in cash used in financing activities from 2019 to 2020 was primarily driven by higher repayments of debt and higher cash dividend payments largely offset by cash proceeds from issuance of new longterm debt in 2020 

we paid dividends totaling 667 million 323 million and 314 million in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively the cash dividend declared per share in 2021 2020 and 2019 was 312 304 and 296 respectively 

our capital allocation strategy is primarily focused on debt repayment to maintain our investment grade rating we will also prioritize capital investment in our businesses to support the strategic long term plans we are also committed to maintaining our history of paying a dividend to investors determined by our board of directors at its discretion based on various factors 

we currently have a board approved stock repurchase program with a total remaining value of 280 million as of may 7 2018 we have suspended our share repurchases 

capital resources 

operating cash flow provides the primary source of funds for capital investment needs dividends paid to shareholders and debt service repayments we anticipate that cash flows from operations and availability under our existing credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our investing and financing needs we regularly assess our capital structure including both current and longterm debt instruments as compared to our cash generation and investment needs in order to provide ample flexibility and to optimize our leverage ratios we believe our existing cash balances are sufficient to meet our debt service requirements

the information above does not include approximately 130 million of the total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions 36 million of associated accrued interest and 81 million associated with the deferred tax liability on deemed repatriation due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential cash flows we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the amount and period in which the remaining liabilities might be paid 

critical accounting policies and use of estimates 

our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements as disclosed in note 1 the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and accompanying disclosures these estimates are based on management’s best judgment of current events and actions that we may undertake in the future actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates 

those areas requiring the greatest degree of management judgment or deemed most critical to our financial reporting involve 

business combinations from time to time we enter into strategic acquisitions in an effort to better service existing customers and to attain new customers when we acquire a controlling financial interest in an entity or group of assets that are determined to meet the definition of a business we apply the acquisition method described in asc topic 805 business combinations in accordance with gaap the results of the acquisitions we have completed are reflected in our financial statements from the date of acquisition forward 

we allocate the purchase consideration paid to acquire the business to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values at the acquisition date with the excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill if during the measurement period a period not to exceed twelve months from the acquisition date we receive additional information that existed as of the acquisition date but at the time of the original allocation described above was unknown to us we make the appropriate adjustments to the purchase price allocation in the reporting period in which the amounts are determined 

significant judgment is required to estimate the intangibles and fair value of fixed assets and in assigning their respective useful lives accordingly we typically engage thirdparty valuation specialists who work under the direction of management to assist in valuing significant tangible and intangible assets acquired 

the fair value estimates are based on available historical information future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management but are inherently uncertain 

we typically use an income method to estimate the fair value of intangible assets which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants and include the amount and timing of future cash flows including expected growth rates discount rates and profitability royalty rates used in the relief of royalty method customer attrition rates product obsolescence factors a brand’s relative market position and the discount rate applied to the cash flows unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions 

determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires significant judgment all of our acquired intangible assets eg trademarks product formulas noncompete agreements and customer relationships are expected to have finite useful lives our estimates of the useful lives of finitelived intangible assets are based on a number of factors including competitive environment market share brand history operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the regions in which the brands are sold 

the costs of finitelived intangible assets are amortized through expense over their estimated lives the value of residual goodwill is not amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment as described in the following note for acquired intangible assets the remaining useful life of the trade names and trademarks product formulas and customer relationships was estimated at the point at which substantially all of the present value of cumulative cash flows have been earned 

the periodic assessment of potential impairment of goodwill as of december 31 2021 we have goodwill of 16414 billion we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level as of november 30 every year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a component to which goodwill is assigned when initially recorded 

we identify our reporting units by assessing whether the components of our operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and management of each operating segment regularly reviews the operating results of those components we have identified seven reporting units under the nourish health  biosciences scent and pharma solutions segments 1 nourish 2 fragrance compounds 3 fragrance ingredients 4 cosmetic actives 5 health  biosciences 6 microbial control and 7 pharma solutions 

for the annual impairment test as of november 30 2021 we utilized step 0 of the guidance in asc topic 350 intangibles – goodwill and other which allows for the assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value if based on a review of qualitative factors it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value a quantitative impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount based on a review of qualitative factors we determined that for four of the reporting units a quantitative step 1 impairment analysis was not necessary to determine if the carrying values of the reporting unit exceeded their fair values for the other three reporting units nourish health  biosciences and pharma solutions we determined that a step 1 test was necessary 

we assessed the fair value of the reporting units primarily using an income approach under the income approach we determined the fair value by using a discounted cash flow method at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the projected future cash flows of each reporting unit as well as a terminal value we use the most current actual and forecasted operating data available key estimates and assumptions used in these valuations include revenue growth rates and profit margins based on our internal forecasts and historical operating trends and our specific weightedaverage cost of capital used to discount future cash flows 

in performing the quantitative test we determined that the fair value of the three reporting units exceeded their carrying values and taken together with the results of the qualitative test we determined that there was no impairment of goodwill at any of our seven reporting units in 2021 based on the quantitative impairment test performed at november 30 2021 we determined that the excess of fair values over their respective carrying values were 62 44 and 29 for the nourish health  biosciences and pharma solutions reporting units respectively 

if current longterm projections for these reporting units are not realized or materially decrease we may be required to writeoff all or a portion of the goodwill such charge could have a material effect on the consolidated statements of operations and balance sheets 

the periodic assessment of potential impairment of longlived assets we review longlived assets for impairment when events or changes in business conditions indicate that their full carrying value may not be recovered an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by an asset or group of assets is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists if assets are determined to be impaired the loss is measured based on an estimate of fair value using various valuation techniques including a discounted estimate of future cash flows

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we operate on a global basis and are exposed to currency fluctuation related to the manufacture and sale of our products in currencies other than the us dollar the major foreign currencies involve the markets in the european union great britain mexico brazil china india indonesia australia russia and japan although all regions are subject to foreign currency fluctuations versus the us dollar we actively monitor our foreign currency exposures in all major markets in which we operate and employ a variety of techniques to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations including foreign currency hedging activities 

we have established a centralized reporting system to evaluate the effects of changes in interest rates currency exchange rates and other relevant market risks our risk management procedures include the monitoring of interest rate and foreign exchange exposures and hedge positions utilizing statistical analyses of cash flows market value and sensitivity analysis however the use of these techniques to quantify the market risk of such instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of their accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions for the year ended december 31 2021 our exposure to market risk was estimated using sensitivity analyses which illustrate the change in the fair value of a derivative financial instrument assuming hypothetical changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts with the objective of reducing exposure to cash flow volatility associated with foreign currency receivables and payables and with anticipated purchases of certain raw materials used in operations these contracts the counterparties to which are major international financial institutions generally involve the exchange of one currency for a second currency at a future date and have maturities not exceeding twelve months the gain or loss on the hedging instrument and services is recorded in earnings at the same time as the transaction being hedged is recorded in earnings at december 31 2021 our foreign currency exposures pertaining to derivative contracts exist with the euro based on a hypothetical decrease or increase of 10 in the applicable balance sheet exchange rates primarily against the us dollar the estimated fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts would increase by approximately less than 1 million however any change in the value of the contracts real or hypothetical would be significantly offset by a corresponding change in the value of the underlying hedged items 

we use derivative instruments as part of our interest rate risk management strategy we have entered into certain cross currency swap agreements in order to mitigate a portion of our net european investments from foreign currency risk as of december 31 2021 these swaps were in a net liability position with an aggregate fair value of 5 million based on a hypothetical decrease or increase of 10 in the value of the us dollar against the euro the estimated fair value of our cross currency swaps would change by approximately 32 million 

at december 31 2021 the fair value of our eur fixed rate debt was 1545 billion based on a hypothetical decrease or increase of 10 in foreign exchange rates the estimated fair value of our eur fixed rate debt would change by approximately 160 million 

at december 31 2021 the fair value of our usd fixed rate debt was 8603 billion based on a hypothetical decrease or increase of 10 in interest rates the estimated fair value of our us fixed rate debt would change by approximately 860 million 

we purchase certain commodities such as natural gas electricity petroleum based products and certain crop related items we generally purchase these commodities based upon market prices that are established with the vendor as part of the purchase process in general we do not use commodity financial instruments to hedge commodity prices

flavor ingredients the flavor ingredients market includes natural flavor extracts specialty botanical extracts distillates essential oils citrus products aroma chemicals and natural gums and resins such ingredients are used for food beverage and flavors and are often sold directly to food and beverage manufacturers who use them in producing consumer products 

scent 

our global scent business creates fragrance compounds and fragrance ingredients that are integral elements in the world’s finest perfumes and bestknown household and personal care products we believe our unique portfolio of natural and synthetic ingredients global footprint innovative technologies and knowhow deep consumer insight and customer intimacy make us a market leader in scent products 

our scent business is a vertically integrated operation originating in our research facilities with the development of natural synthetic and proprietary molecules and innovative delivery systems progressing to our creative centers application laboratories and consumer insight teams where our perfumers partner with our customers to create unique fragrance compounds for use in a variety of enduse products we produce these products in our manufacturing facilities in a consistent highquality and costeffective manner we also produce cosmetic active and functional ingredients for use in cosmetics by providing our fragrance development teams with an extensive portfolio of innovative highquality and effective ingredients to support their creativity we are able to provide our customers with a unique identity for their brands these ingredients or fragrance compounds can then be combined with our innovative delivery systems which are key differentiators in the growth of our consumer fragrance portfolio 

fragrance compounds  fragrance compounds are unique and proprietary combinations of multiple ingredients that are ultimately used by our customers in their consumer goods our creative and commercial teams within fragrance compounds are organized into two broad categories fine fragrances and consumer fragrances 

our fine fragrances focus on perfumes and colognes our scientists and perfumers collaborate to develop new molecules new natural extractions and innovative processes to create unique and inspiring fragrances we have created some of the industryleading fine fragrance classics as well as cuttingedge niche fragrances as evidenced by the number of top sellers and award winners

consumer insights research and product development process 

the markets in which we compete require constant innovation to remain competitive consumer preferences tend to drive change in our markets and as science evolves and sustainability continues to be a key factor to customers and consumers we must continue to strengthen our research and development platforms and adapt our capabilities to provide differentiated products 

consumer insights 

we believe that the first step to creating an innovative and unique product experience begins with gaining insight into the consumer and emerging trends by developing a deep understanding of what consumers value and prefer through our consumer insight programs we are better able to focus our research and development and creative efforts 

our consumer science insight and marketing teams interpret trends monitor product launches analyze quantitative market data and conduct numerous consumer interviews annually our sensory experts direct research programs exploring topics such as fragrance performance the psychophysics of sensory perception including chemesthetic properties such as warming cooling and tingling the genetic basis for flavor and fragrance preference and the effects of aromas on mood performance health and wellbeing 

based on this information we develop innovative and proprietary programs to evaluate potential products that enable us to understand the emotional connections between a prospective product and the consumer we believe this ability to pinpoint the likelihood of a product’s success translates into stronger brand equity resulting in increased returns and greater market share gains for our customers as well as for iff 

research and development 

we consider our research and development infrastructure to be one of our key competencies and critical to our ability to provide differentiated products to our customers we focus and invest substantial resources in the research and development of new and innovative molecules compounds formulations and technologies and the application of these to our customers’ products using the knowledge gained from our consumer insights programs and business unit needs we strategically focus our resources around key research and development platforms that address or anticipate consumer needs or preferences by aligning our capabilities and resources to these platforms we ensure the proper support and focus for each program so that they can be further developed and eventually accepted for commercial application 

as of december 31 2020 we have been granted 430 patents in the united states since 2000 and have 564 pending patent applications we have developed many unique molecules and delivery systems for our customers that are used as the foundations of successful flavors and fragrances around the world 

we have historically conducted our principal basic research and development activities in union beach new jersey where we employ scientists and application engineers who collaborate with our other research and development centers around the world to support the 

• discovery of new materials 

• development of new technologies such as delivery systems 

• creation of new compounds and 

• enhancement of existing ingredients and compounds 

following the nb transaction we expect that our principal basic research and development activities will continue in union beach new jersey as well as in wilmington delaware palo alto california barbrand denmark and leiden the netherlands the nb business has strong product and application development pipelines built upon a global network that includes research and development as well as regulatory and product stewardship capabilities 

as of december 31 2020 we employed approximately 2600 people globally in research and development activities including in key basic research and development centers in union beach new jersey tilburg the netherlands neuilly and grasse france and nanjing china 

our ingredients research program discovers molecules found in natural substances and creates new molecules that are subsequently tested for their sensorial value to broaden our offerings of natural innovative and unique products we have established a number of collaborations with research institutions and other companies throughout the world we may also consider acquiring companies that could provide access to new technologies 

the development of new and customized flavor and fragrance compounds is a complex process calling upon the combined knowledge of our scientists flavorists and perfumers scientists from various disciplines work in project teams with flavorists and perfumers to develop flavor and fragrance compounds with consumer preferred performance characteristics the development of new flavor and fragrance compounds requires i an indepth knowledge of the flavor and fragrance characteristics of the various ingredients we use ii an understanding of how the many ingredients in a consumer product interact and iii the creation of controlled release and delivery systems to enhance flavor and fragrance performance to facilitate this process we have a scientific advisory board that provides external perspectives and independent feedback on our research and development and sustainability initiatives 

creative application 

through our global network of creative centers and application laboratories we create or adapt the basic flavors or fragrances compounds that we have developed in the research and development process to commercialize for use in our customers’ consumer products our global creative teams consist of perfumers fragrance evaluators and flavorists as well as marketing consumer science consumer insights and technical application experts from a wide range of cultures and nationalities in close partnership with our customers’ product development groups our creative teams create the sensory experiences that our customers are seeking in order to satisfy consumer demands in each of their respective markets 

new flavor and fragrance development is driven by a variety of sources including requests from our customers who are in need of specific flavors and fragrances for use in a new or modified consumer product or as a result of internal initiatives stemming from our consumer insights program our product development team works in partnership with our scientists and researchers to optimize the consumer appeal and relevance of our flavors and fragrances we use a collaborative process between our researchers our product development team and our customers to perfect the flavors and fragrances so they are ready to be included in the final consumer product 

in addition to creating new flavors and fragrances our researchers and product development teams advise customers on ways to improve their existing products by moderating or substituting current ingredients with more readily accessible or less expensive materials enhancing their yield this often results in creating a better value proposition for our customers 

our flavors and fragrances compound formulas are treated as trade secrets and remain our proprietary assets our business is not materially dependent upon any individual patent trademark or license 

supply chain 

we strive to provide our customers with consistent and quality products on a timely and costeffective basis by managing all aspects of the supply chain from raw material sourcing through manufacturing quality assurance regulatory compliance and distribution 

procurement 

in connection with the manufacture of compounds we use natural ingredients and primarily in our fragrance compounds synthetic ingredients as of december 31 2020 we purchased approximately 124500 different raw materials sourced from an extensive network of domestic and international suppliers and distributors 

the nb transaction will significantly increase the number of natural products that we will source and the percentage of our ingredients that are natural or croprelated natural ingredients are derived from flowers fruits and other botanical products as well as from animal and marine products and commodity crops like wheat corn and soy they contain varying numbers of organic chemicals that are responsible for the fragrance flavor antioxidant properties and nutrition of the natural products natural products are purchased directly from farms or in processed and semiprocessed forms some natural products are used in compounds in the state in which they are obtained and others are used after further processing natural products together with various chemicals are also used as raw materials for the manufacture of synthetic ingredients by chemical processes 

in order to ensure our supply of raw materials achieve favorable pricing and provide timely transparency regarding inflationary trends to our customers we continue to focus on 

• purchasing under contract with fixed or formulabased pricing for set time periods 

• entering into supplier relationships to gain access to supplies we would not otherwise have 

• implementing indexed pricing 

• reducing the complexity of our formulations 

• evaluating the profitability of whether to buy or make an ingredient and 

• sourcing from local countries with our own procurement professionals 

manufacturing and distribution 

as of december 31 2020 we had 242 manufacturing facilities creative centers and application laboratories located in 47 different countries our major manufacturing facilities are located in the united states the netherlands spain great britain germany indonesia turkey brazil mexico slovenia china india and singapore based on the regional nature of the taste business and the logistical concerns regarding the fragile nature of transporting raw materials we have typically established smaller manufacturing facilities in our local markets that are focused on local needs products within the scent business are typically composed of compounds that are more stable and more transportable consequently we have fewer manufacturing facilities within our scent business which produce compounds and ingredients for global distribution 

during the last few years we undertook an initiative to optimize our global operations footprint to efficiently and costeffectively deliver value to our global customers during 2020 we announced the closure of eleven sites of which five sites were in europe africa and middle east four sites were in north america and two sites were in greater asia as a continuation of this initiative we expect to close approximately nine additional manufacturing sites by the end of 2021 

our supply chain initiatives are focused on increasing capacity and investing in key technologies within our more mature markets we tend to focus on consolidation and cost optimization as well as the implementation of new technologies in addition to our own manufacturing facilities we develop relationships with third parties including contract manufacturing organizations that expand our access to the technologies capabilities and capacity that we need to better serve our customers 

sustainability 

over the past several years we have redefined the way we envision sustainability moving from the traditional “takemakedispose” model we have embraced the circular economy model  one that is restorative and regenerative by design which we believe is key in safeguarding the wellbeing of consumers the health of our planet and the integrity of our business 

customers and consumers of our products want to know if the products they are purchasing are responsibly sourced and produced in an environmentally conscious manner our sustainability vision and strategy are designed to address these global trends and we are committed to making real progress happen at every opportunity following the nb transaction and the frutarom acquisition we have been working on evaluating our expanded environmental footprint and integrating and updating the nb business and frutaroms sustainability practices to align them with legacy iff sustainability practices 

in line with our purpose of applying science and creativity for a better world our sustainability goals include 

• reducing our environmental footprint  we seek to leverage synergies to reduce our operational impact in ways that will mitigate climate change conserve water and reduce waste 

• strengthening responsible sourcing  we seek to ensure ethical practices in our supply chain reduce impact to the environment and support workers and grower communities 

• driving sustainable innovation  we seek to embed regenerative approaches and circular design principles into our products processes and rd pipeline 

• embracing people and communities  we seek to nurture an inclusive culture where we celebrate diversity and give back to the communities where we source and operate 

in 2020 we were named for the first time to the dow jones sustainability indices a family of bestinclass benchmarks for investors who recognize that sustainable business practices are critical to generating longterm shareholder value named to both the 2020 world index and the north america index this distinction validates iff’s leadership position in sustainability performance and underscores our commitment to executing on key environmental social and governance esg priorities we were also awarded the 2020 ecovadis platinum sustainability rating a highly selective designation by ecovadis a leading platform for monitoring sustainability in global supply chains this distinction places iff in the top 1 of companies assessed in the areas of environment labor  human rights ethics and sustainable procurement in addition among other distinctions in 2019 we were named one of barron’s 100 most sustainable companies for the third consecutive year and listed in the ftse4good index series as well as in the euronext vigeo world 120 index for esg performance 

our commitment to good governance starts with our board and executive committee and is supported by a strong governance framework this framework is implemented through our organization with frequent communications and trainings on best practices in governance risk management business conduct compliance and ethics moreover we adhere to the highest standards of ethics integrity honesty and respect in our dealings with each other and our business partners to maintain those relationships and our strong reputation we have a robust program to ensure compliance with our codes 

for more detailed information about our sustainability programs and performance please refer to our annual sustainability report 

governmental regulation 

we develop produce and market our products in a number of jurisdictions around the world and are subject to federal regional and local legislation and regulations in various countries our products which among other industries are intended for use in food beverage pharmaceutical industries home and personal care are subject to strict quality and regulatory standards and environmental laws and regulations we in turn are required to meet strict standards which in recent years have become increasingly stringent and affect both existing as well as new products while the cost of compliance with such laws and regulations leads to higher overall capital expenditure which can be significant in certain periods we do not know of any material capital expenditures necessary to comply with such laws and regulations we continue to monitor existing and pending laws and regulations and while the impact of regulatory changes cannot be predicted with certainty compliance has not had and is not expected to have a material adverse effect on capital expenditure earnings or competitive position 

our products and operations are subject to regulation by governmental agencies in each of the markets in which we operate these agencies include 1 the food and drug administration and equivalent international agencies that regulate flavors pharmaceutical excipients and other ingredients in consumer products 2 the environmental protection agency and equivalent international agencies that regulate our manufacturing facilities as well as fragrance products including encapsulation systems and microbial products 3 the occupational safety and health administration and equivalent international agencies that regulate the working conditions in our manufacturing research laboratories and creative centers 4 local and international agencies that regulate trade and customs 5 the drug enforcement administration and other local or international agencies that regulate controlled chemicals that we use in our operations 6 the chemical registrationnotification authorities that regulate chemicals that we use in or transport to the various countries in which we manufacture andor market our products and 7 the us department of agriculture and equivalent international authorities with respect to among other things labeling of consumer products we have seen an increase in registration and reporting requirements concerning the use of certain chemicals in a number of countries such as registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals “reach” regulations in the european union as well as similar regulations in other countries the acquisitions of frutarom and nb will broaden the landscape of regulatory compliance requirements applicable to iff 

in addition we are subject to various rules relating to health work safety and the environment at the local and international levels in the various countries in which we operate our manufacturing facilities throughout the world are subject to environmental standards relating to air emissions sewage discharges the use of hazardous materials waste disposal practices and cleanup of existing environmental contamination in recent years there has been an increase in the stringency of environmental regulation and enforcement of environmental standards and the costs of compliance have risen significantly a trend we expect will continue in the future 

competition 

the markets for taste and scent are part of a larger market that supplies a wide variety of ingredients and compounds used in consumer products the broader market includes functional foods and food additives including seasonings texturizers spices enzymes certain foodrelated commodities and fortified products as well as nutritional ingredients supplements and active cosmetic ingredients 

the global market for taste and scent has expanded primarily as a result of an increase in demand for and an increase in the variety of consumer products containing flavors and fragrances 

the market for taste and scent is highly competitive based on annual sales our main competitors consist of 1 other large global flavor and fragrance manufacturers givaudan firmenich and symrise 2 midsized companies 3 numerous regional and local manufacturers and 4 consumer product companies who may develop their own flavors or fragrances 

we believe that our ability to create products with the sustainability related attributes customers expect and compete successfully in the flavors and fragrances submarket is based on 

• our indepth understanding of consumers 

• vertical integration 

• innovation and technological advances from our research and development activities and our perfumers and flavorists 

• our ability to tailor products to customers’ needs 

• our ability to manufacture products on a global scale and 

• broadbased regulatory capabilities 

large multinational customers and increasingly midsized customers may limit the number of their suppliers by placing some on “core lists” giving them priority for development and production of their new or modified products to compete more successfully we must make continued investments in customer relationships and tailor our research and development efforts to anticipate customers’ needs provide effective service and secure and maintain inclusion on these “core lists” 

private label manufacturers mostly mediumsized local or small food manufacturers constitute a growing segment in the flavor market over the last decade with the strengthening of supermarket chains online platforms and growing consumer price consciousness consumption of private label products has grown at a faster rate than the brand food industry rate we believe that new business opportunities will continue to arise from these clients as they are increasing their demand for products that are similar to existing products in the market distinctive premium products as well as more innovative products 

the global demand for functional foods food additives natural ingredients nutritional ingredients and supplements and active cosmetic ingredients is also growing with our recent acquisitions we have expanded our offerings to include products within the functional food ingredient market including ingredients focused on improving the health and wellness characteristics of a consumer good the nutritional supplement and infant nutrition markets and the cosmetic actives market while the three other large global flavor and fragrance manufacturers givaudan firmenich and symrise are active in these areas we also compete with specialty chemical companies other large multinational companies and smaller regional and local participants that offer products that address these same needs

risk factors 

we routinely encounter and address risks in conducting our business some of these risks may cause our future results to be different  sometimes materially different  than we presently anticipate below are material risks we have identified that could adversely affect our business how we react to material future developments as well as how our competitors and customers react to those developments could also affect our future results 

risks related to our business and industry 

the covid19 pandemic may materially and adversely impact our operations financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

covid19 was identified in china in late 2019 and since then has spread globally government authorities including those in countries where we have manufacturing and other operations have taken various measures to try to contain this spread such as the closure of nonessential businesses reduced travel the closure of retail establishments the promotion of social distancing and remote working policies where appropriate these measures have impacted and may further impact our workforce and operations and the operations of our customers vendors and suppliers 

the covid19 pandemic has subjected our operations financial condition and results of operations to a number of risks including but not limited to those discussed below 

• operationsrelated risks our manufacturing plants continue to operate worldwide in compliance with the orders and restrictions imposed by government authorities in each of our locations and we are working with our customers to meet their specific shipment needs most plants have restored operations to historical levels notwithstanding that certain restrictions imposed to ensure safe operations remain in place in some instances the nb businesss manufacturing sites have reduced certain operations or furloughed employees in response to government measures employee welfare concerns and the impact of covid19 on the global demand and supply chain some of our research and development and creative applications centers are operating on limited schedules or with a reduced workforce of essential employees as a result of certain safety measures implemented by us to limit the number of the onsite workforce 

our ability to continue to supply our products is highly dependent on our ability to maintain the safety of our workforce the ability of employees to work may be significantly impacted by individuals contracting or being exposed to covid19 and our operations and financial results may be negatively affected as a result we have developed returntoworkplace protocols and mandatory site guidelines to continue to protect the health and safety of employees at each location and to promote an orderly and phased return for employees who have been working from home while we are following the requirements of governmental authorities and taking additional preventative and protective measures to ensure the safety of our workforce there can be no assurance that these measures will be successful and to the extent that employees in our manufacturing or distribution centers contract covid19 we may be required to temporarily close those facilities which may result in reduced production hours more rigorous cleaning processes and other preventative and protective measures for employees workforce disruptions of this nature may significantly impact our ability to maintain our operations and may adversely impact our financial results 

resolving such operational challenges has increased certain costs such as labor shipping and cleaning and the failure to resolve such challenges may result in our inability to deliver products to our customers and reduce sales 

• supply chainrelated risks we have experienced some disruption primarily regarding distribution of certain raw materials and transport logistics in markets where governments have implemented the strictest regulations more significant disruptions may occur if the covid19 pandemic continues to impact markets around the world in addition as a result of disruptions or uncertainty relating to the covid19 pandemic we are experiencing and may continue to experience increased costs delays or limited availability related to raw materials shipping and transportation resources which has negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact our margins and operating results 

• customerrelated risks  we are experiencing and may continue to experience changes in the demand and volume for certain of our products including due to consumption or stocking behavior changes for example ingredients used in products sold mainly in retail outlets such as fine fragrances or taste products used in retail food services have seen a decrease in demand as these outlets have closed due to covid19 related restrictions similarly the nb business experienced covid19 related declines in demand from food service distribution channels and for products for the oil and gas and select industrial endmarkets including for biorefinery and microbial control in addition we have received requests for extensions in payment terms from some customers in select markets whose products are experiencing reduced demand 

although we do not currently anticipate any impairment charges related to covid19 the continuing effects of a prolonged pandemic could result in increased risk to us of asset writedowns and impairments including but not limited to equity investments goodwill and intangibles any of these events could potentially result in a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

• integration execution risks  the travel and operational restrictions related to covid19 have changed the way we operate interact and collaborate internally and externally if these restrictions persist they may impact our ability to prepare and implement detailed integration plans in connection with the nb business needed to achieve our revenue and cost synergy targets 

• marketrelated risks the funding obligations for our pension plans will be impacted by the performance of the financial markets particularly the equity markets and interest rates lower interest rates and lower expected asset valuations and returns can materially impact the calculation of longterm liabilities such as pension liabilities in addition the volatility in financial and commodities markets may have adverse impacts on other asset valuations such as the value of the investment portfolios supporting pension obligations if the financial markets do not provide the longterm returns that are expected we could be required to make larger contributions 

in addition to the risks noted above covid19 may also heighten other risks described herein including but not limited to risks related to a decrease in global demand for consumer products manufacturing disruptions disruption or cost increases in the supply chain price volatility for raw materials level of indebtedness currency fluctuations and impairment of longlived assets the magnitude of the impact of the covid19 pandemic including the extent of its impact on our operating and financial results will be determined by the length of time that the pandemic continues and while government authorities’ measures relating to covid19 may be relaxed if and when covid19 abates these measures may be reinstated as the pandemic continues to evolve the scope and timing of any such reinstatements are difficult to predict and may materially impact our operations in the future as covid19 continues to adversely impact the broader global economy including negatively impacting economic growth and creating disruption and volatility in the global financial and capital markets which increases the cost of capital and adversely impacts the availability of and access to capital this could negatively affect our liquidity which could in turn negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition the covid19 pandemic may also affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not expect to present significant risks 

the integration of the nb business may present significant challenges and we may not realize anticipated synergies and other benefits of the nb transaction 

the combination of large diverse and independent businesses is complex costly and timeconsuming designing and building our combined operating models along with the necessary business processes systems and infrastructure in connection with our combination with the nb business may divert significant management attention and resources and disrupt our legacy business the failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating the businesses and to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction could cause an interruption of or a loss of momentum in our business activities and could adversely affect our results of operations the overall combination with the nb business may also result in material unanticipated problems expenses liabilities competitive responses employee turnover and loss of customer and other business relationships the difficulties of integration include among others 

• the diversion of management attention to integration matters 

• integrating operations and systems including intellectual property and communications systems administrative and information technology infrastructure and financial reporting and internal control systems some of which may prove to be incompatible 

• conforming standards controls procedures and accounting and other policies business cultures and compensation structures between the businesses 

• integrating employees and attracting and retaining key personnel including talent 

• retaining existing and obtaining new customers and suppliers 

• integrating and managing the expanded operations of a significantly larger and more complex company 

• contingent liabilities that are larger than expected and 

• potential unknown liabilities adverse consequences and unforeseen increased expenses associated with the transaction 

many of these factors are outside of our complete control andor will be outside the control of the nb business and any one of them could result in lower revenues higher costs and diversion of management time and energy which could materially impact the business financial condition and results of operations of our business we bear full responsibility for any and all nb liabilities and issues with nb assets following the closing of the nb transaction even if related to a breach of a representation under the merger agreement to the extent any such nb liabilities are larger than anticipated or an issue with an nb asset prohibits the nb business from performing as planned it could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition even if the operations of the nb business are integrated successfully the full benefits of the transaction may not be realized including among others the synergies cost savings or revenue growth that are expected these benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all further additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the nb business all of these factors could cause dilution to our earnings per share decrease or delay the projected accretive effect of the nb transaction and negatively impact the price of iff common stock following the nb transaction 

the substantial amount of indebtedness that we incurred in connection with the nb transaction could materially adversely affect our financial condition 

in connection with the nb transaction our consolidated indebtedness and that of our subsidiaries include the indebtedness incurred by nb in the debt financings completed prior to the nb transaction increasing our indebtedness by 75 billion as of december 31 2020 our total debt consisted of 44 billion despite our level of indebtedness we expect to continue to have the ability to borrow additional debt 

there may be circumstances in which required payments of principal andor interest on our debt could adversely affect our cash flows our operating results or our ability to return capital to our shareholders furthermore our degree of leverage could adversely affect our future credit ratings if we are unable to maintain or improve our current investment grade rating it could adversely affect our future cost of funding liquidity and access to capital markets in addition our current level of leverage could increase our vulnerability to sustained adverse macroeconomic weakness limit our ability to obtain further financing and our ability to pursue certain operational and strategic opportunities including large acquisitions our level of indebtedness as well as our failure to comply with covenants under our debt instruments could adversely affect our business results of operation and financial condition or our ability to return capital to our shareholders and the additional debt instruments may subject us to additional covenants 

we have incurred and will incur substantial direct and indirect costs as a result of the nb transaction 

we have incurred and will incur substantial expenses or required investments in connection with and as a result of completing the nb transaction including financial advisory legal accounting consulting and other integration related advisory fees and expenses regulatory filings and filing and printing fees 

in addition over a period of time following the closing we expect to incur substantial expenses in connection with transitioning integrating and coordinating the businesses operations policies and procedures of us and the nb business while we have assumed that a certain level of transaction expenses will be incurred factors beyond our control could affect the total amount or the timing of these expenses many of the expenses that will be incurred by their nature are difficult to estimate accurately these costs could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations prior to the transaction and of the combined businesses following the transaction 

in connection with the nb transaction we are required to abide by potentially significant restrictions which could limit our ability to undertake certain corporate actions such as the issuance of common stock or the undertaking of a merger or consolidation that otherwise could be advantageous 

during the two year period following the closing of the nb transaction we and our respective subsidiaries are generally prohibited from taking certain actions that could cause certain aspects of the nb transaction and certain historic transactions undertaken by dupont to fail to qualify as taxfree transactions unless we receive either i an opinion of counsel or ii a ruling from the irs or other applicable tax authority in either case acceptable to dupont in dupont’s discretion to the effect that such action or actions will not cause a relevant transaction to fail to qualify as a taxfree transaction these restrictions may limit our ability to pursue certain strategic transactions or engage in other transactions including using iff common stock to make acquisitions and in connection with equity capital market transactions or disposing of certain businesses that might increase the value of our business 

we may be unable to provide or obtain from thirdparties the same types and level of services to the nb business that historically have been provided by dupont or may be unable to provide or obtain them at the same cost 

as part of dupont the nb business received services from dupont following the nb transaction we will need to replace these services either by providing them internally from our existing services or by obtaining them from unaffiliated third parties these services include certain corporate level functions of which the effective and appropriate performance is critical to our operations following the nb transaction while dupont will provide certain services on a transitional basis pursuant to the transition services agreements entered into in connection with the nb transaction the duration of such services is generally limited to no longer than three years from the date of the separation of dupont and the nb business for information technology services and no longer than two years from the date of the separation of dupont and the nb business for all other services we may be unable to replace these services in a timely manner or on terms and conditions as favorable as those the nb business previously received from dupont the costs for these services could in the aggregate be higher than the combination of our current costs and those reflected in the historical financial statements of the nb business if we are not 

able to replace the services provided by dupont or we are unable to replace them at the same cost or is delayed in replacing the services provided by dupont our results of operations may be materially adversely impacted 

our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected following the nb transaction if we cannot negotiate terms that are as favorable as those dupont has received when we replace contracts after the closing of the nb transaction 

as a part of dupont the nb business has been able to benefit from dupont’s financial strength extensive business relationships and purchasing power following the nb transaction we will not be able to leverage dupont’s financial strength may not have access to all of dupont’s extensive business relationships and may not have purchasing power similar to what the nb business benefited from by being a part of dupont prior to the nb transaction it is therefore possible whether as a result of routine renegotiations of terms in the ordinary course of business or as part of a request for a renewal replacement or amendment of a contract that we may not be able to negotiate terms as favorable as those dupont has received and in the aggregate it is possible that the loss or renegotiation of contracts in connection with the foregoing could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations following the closing of the nb transactions by increasing costs or decreasing revenues 

our success will also depend on relationships with third parties and our preexisting customers and the preexisting customers of the nb business which relationships may be affected by customer or thirdparty preferences or public attitudes about the nb transaction any adverse changes in these relationships could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

our success will depend on the ability to maintain renew and grow our relationships with preexisting customers suppliers and other third parties of ours and of the nb business and our ability to establish new relationships there can be no assurance that our business will be able to maintain and renew preexisting contracts and other business relationships or enter into or maintain new contracts and other business relationships on acceptable terms if at all the failure to maintain important business relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we may not realize all the synergies and other benefits anticipated from the frutarom acquisition which could adversely affect our business 

the full benefits of the frutarom acquisition depend on the continuing realization of cost synergies through global footprint optimization across manufacturing the realization of procurement synergies organizational and operational efficiencies in overhead expenses as well as revenue growth and synergies by leveraging customer relationships across a much broader customer base and crossselling legacy iff and frutarom capabilities these benefits and the expected revenue growth may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all further additional unanticipated costs may be incurred as we continue to work towards achieving the full cost and revenue synergies if the anticipated benefits from the frutarom acquisition are not fully realized or take longer to realize than expected the value of our common stock revenues levels of expenses and results of operations may be adversely affected 

if we are unable to successfully market to our expanded and diverse customer base our operating results and future growth may be adversely affected 

as a result of our acquisition of frutarom and the nb transaction the number of our customers significantly increased and became more diverse our historical customer base was primarily comprised of large and mediumsized food beverage and consumer products companies based on 2020 sales we had approximately 33000 customers approximately 65 of which are small and midsized companies following the nb transaction our customer base has further increased significantly this substantial increase in and diversity of our customer base requires us to adjust among other things our product development manufacturing distribution marketing customer relationship and sales strategy as well as adapt corporate information technology finance and administrative infrastructures to support different gotomarket models we may experience difficulty managing the growth of a portfolio of customers that is more diverse in terms of its geographical presence as well as with respect to the types of services they require and the infrastructure required to deliver our products if we are unable to successfully gain market share or maintain our relationships with these customers our future growth could be adversely affected 

failure to successfully establish and manage acquisitions collaborations joint ventures or partnerships could adversely affect our growth 

from time to time we evaluate acquisition candidates that may strategically fit our business andor growth objectives if we are unable to successfully integrate and develop acquired businesses we could fail to achieve anticipated synergies and cost savings including any expected increase in revenues and operating results which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results we may also incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions that reduce our earnings 

additionally we also evaluate and enter into collaborations joint ventures or partnerships from time to time to enhance our research and development efforts or expand our product portfolios and technology the process of establishing and maintaining collaborative relationships is difficult and timeconsuming to negotiate document and implement we may not be able to 

successfully negotiate such arrangements or the terms of the arrangements may not be as favorable as anticipated furthermore our ability to generate revenues from such collaborations will depend on our partners’ abilities and efforts to successfully perform the functions assigned to them in these arrangements and these collaborations may not lead to development or commercialization of products in the most efficient manner or at all in addition from time to time we have acquired and we may acquire only a majority interest in companies and provided or may provide earnouts for the former owners along with the ability at our option or obligation at the former owners’ option to purchase the minority interests at a future date at an established price these investments may have additional risks and may not be as efficient as other operations as we may have fiduciary or contractual obligations to the minority investors and may rely on former owners for the continuing operation of the acquired business if we are unable to successfully establish and manage these collaborative relationships and majority investments it could adversely affect our future growth 

our business is highly competitive and if we are unable to compete effectively our sales and results of operations will suffer 

the markets in which we compete are highly competitive we face vigorous competition from companies throughout the world including multinational and specialized companies active in flavors fragrances enzymes pharmaceutical excipients nutrition and specialty ingredients as well as consumer product companies which may develop their own flavors fragrances or ingredients in the flavors industry we also face increasing competition from ingredient suppliers that have expanded their portfolios to include flavor offerings some of our competitors specialize in one or more of our product subsegments while others participate in many of our product subsegments in addition some of our global competitors may have more resources than we do or may have proprietary products that could permit them to respond to changing business and economic conditions more effectively than we can consolidation of or partnerships among our competitors may exacerbate these risks 

as we continue to enter into adjacent markets such as cosmetic ingredients functional foods specialty fine ingredients and nutrition products we may face greater competitionrelated risks in these markets than with our core historic flavor and fragrances businesses for example the specialty fine ingredients market is more price sensitive than the flavors market and is characterized by relatively lower profit margins some fine ingredients products are less unique and more replaceable than competitors’ products there is no assurance that operating margins will remain at current levels which could substantially impact our business operating results and financial condition 

competition in our business is based among other things on innovation product quality regulatory compliance pricing quality of customer service the support provided by marketing and application groups and understanding of consumers it is difficult for us to predict the timing scale and success of our competitors’ actions in these areas in particular the discovery and development of new products protection of our intellectual property and development and retention of key employees are critical to our ability to effectively compete in our business advancement in technologies have also enhanced the ability of our competitors to develop substitutable products increased competition by existing or future competitors including aggressive price competition could result in the loss of sales reduced pricing and margin pressure and could adversely impact our sales and profitability 

failing to identify and make capital expenditures to achieve growth opportunities being unable to make new concepts scalable or failing to effectively and timely reinvest in our business operations could result in the loss of competitive position and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

our success depends on attracting and retaining talented people within our business significant shortfalls in recruitment or retention could adversely affect our ability to compete and achieve our strategic goals 

attracting developing and retaining talented employees including our perfumers scientists and flavorists is essential to the successful delivery of our products and success in the marketplace furthermore as we continue to focus on innovation our need for scientists and other professionals will increase the ability to attract and retain talented employees is critical in the development of new products and technologies which is an integral component of our growth strategy 

competition for employees can be intense and if we are unable to successfully integrate motivate and reward the acquired frutarom employees employees from the nb business or our current employees in our combined company we may not be able to retain them if we are unable to retain these employees or attract new employees in the future our ability to effectively compete with our competitors and to grow our business could be adversely affected 

a significant portion of our sales is generated from a limited number of large multinational customers which are currently under competitive pressures that may affect the demand for our products and profitability 

during 2020 our 25 largest customers each of which was a multinational consumer products company collectively accounted for 39 of our sales in the aggregate large multinational customers’ market share especially in the consumer product industry continues to be pressured by new smaller companies and specialty players that cater to or are more adept at adjusting to the latest consumer trends including towards natural products and clean labels changes in the retail landscape including ecommerce and consolidation and increased competition from private labels which have resulted and may 

continue to result in decreased demand for our products by such multinational customers and volume erosion especially in our taste business furthermore consolidations amongst our customers have resulted in larger and more sophisticated customers with greater buying power and additional negotiating strength if such trends continue our sales could be adversely impacted if we are not able to replace these sales 

in addition large multinational customers and increasingly middle market customers continue to utilize “core lists” of suppliers to improve margins and profitability typically these “core list suppliers are then given priority for new or modified products recently these customers are making inclusion on their “core lists” contingent upon a supplier providing more favorable commercial terms including rebates which could adversely affect our margins we must either offer competitive costinuse solutions to secure and maintain inclusion on these “core lists” or seek to manage the relationship without being on the “corelist” if we choose not to pursue “corelist” status due to profitability concerns or if we are unable to obtain “corelist” status our ability to maintain our share of these customers’ future purchases could be adversely affected and therefore our future results of operations 

we may not successfully develop and introduce new products that meet our customers’ needs which may adversely affect our results of operations 

our ability to differentiate ourselves and deliver growth largely depends on our ability to successfully develop and introduce new products and product improvements that meet our customers’ needs and ultimately appeal to consumers innovation is a key element of our ability to develop and introduce new products we cannot be certain that we will be successful in achieving our innovation goals such as the development of new molecules new and expanded delivery systems and other technologies we currently spend approximately 70 of our sales on research and development however this investment level may vary in the future if available resources to invest in research and development are limited due to our ongoing integration and restructuring efforts our research and development investments may only generate future revenues to the extent that we are able to develop products that meet our customers’ specifications are at an acceptable cost and achieve acceptance by the targeted consumer market furthermore there may be significant lag times from the time we incur research and development costs to the time that these research and development costs may result in increased revenue consequently even when we “win” a project our ability to generate revenues as a result of these investments is subject to numerous customer economic and other risks that are outside of our control including delays by our customers in the launch of a new product the level of promotional support for the launch poor performance of our thirdparty vendors anticipated sales by our customers not being realized or changes in market preferences or demands or disruptive innovations by competitors 

natural disasters public health crises such as the covid19 international conflicts terrorist acts labor strikes political crisis accidents and other events could adversely affect our business and financial results by disrupting development manufacturing distribution or sale of our products 

as a company engaged in the global development manufacture and distribution of products we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities including industrial accidents environmental events strikes and other labor disputes product quality control issues safety licensing requirements and other regulatory issues as well as natural disasters public health crises such as pandemics or epidemics international conflicts terrorist acts and other external factors over which we have no control 

while we operate research and development manufacturing and distribution facilities throughout the world many of these facilities are extremely specialized and certain of our research and development or creative laboratories facilities are uniquely situated to support our research and development efforts while certain of our manufacturing facilities are the sole location where a specific ingredient or product is produced if our research and development activities or the manufacturing of ingredients or products were disrupted the cost of relocating or replacing these activities or reformulating these ingredients or products may be substantial which could result in production or development delays or otherwise have an adverse effect on our margins operating results and future growth 

for example in december 2019 there was an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus covid19 in wuhan china that has since spread to other regions in china and the rest of the world as a result of restrictions imposed by governments to contain the outbreak a portion of our manufacturing plants and offices were required to close the outbreak may result in additional or more extensive travel restrictions closures disruptions of businesses or facilities in affected regions around the world or lead to social economic political or labor instability in the affected areas may impact our our suppliers’ or our customers’ operations the outbreak may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations at this point the extent of such impact is uncertain 

a disruption in our supply chain including the inability to obtain ingredients and raw materials from third parties could adversely affect our business and financial results 

in connection with our manufacture of our fragrance and flavor products we often rely on third party suppliers for ingredients and raw materials that are integral to our manufacture of such compounds in addition with the nb transaction we significantly increased our natural products and as a result the percentage of our ingredients that are natural or croprelated 

has increased our purchases of raw materials are subject to fluctuations in market price and availability caused by weather conditions climate change as further discussed below market conditions governmental actions and other factors beyond our control affecting us andor our suppliers import alerts or specific country regulations may impair or delay our ability to obtain sufficient quantity of certain ingredients raw materials and naturals at the relevant manufacturing facility in addition our ingredient or raw material suppliers similar to us are subject to risks as applicable inherent in agriculture manufacturing and distribution on a global scale including industrial accidents environmental events strikes and other labor disputes disruptions in supply chain or information systems disruption or loss of key research or manufacturing sites product quality control safety and environmental compliance issues licensing requirements and other regulatory issues as well as natural disasters global or local health crisis international conflicts terrorist acts and other external factors over which they have no control for example as a result of the outbreak of covid19 the ability of our suppliers and vendors to provide products and services to us may be impaired or delayed these suppliers also could become insolvent or experience other financial distress for example in 2017 a fire at the manufacturing facility of basf group “basf” one of our suppliers caused them to declare a force majeure and has resulted in industry disruption due to the lack of availability of certain ingredients used in many fragrance compounds 

these risks are enhanced since we often rely on a limited number of suppliers for particular ingredients if our suppliers are unable to supply us with sufficient quantities of ingredients and raw materials to meet our needs we would need to seek alternative sources of such materials or pursue our own production of such ingredients or direct acquisition of such raw materials however for certain of our ingredients and raw materials we rely on a limited number of suppliers where there are not readily available alternatives if we are unable to obtain or manufacture alternative sources of such ingredients or raw materials at a similar cost we would seek to i reformulate our compounds andor ii increase pricing to reflect the higher supply cost however if we are not able to successfully implement any of these alternatives we could experience disruptions in production increased cost of sales and a corresponding decrease in gross margin or reduced sales especially if our competitors were able to more successfully adjust to such market disruption at the same time industrywide supply disruptions such as the one caused by the basf incident may lead to broader market shortages and sales volatility such fluctuations and decrease in gross margin could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

volatility and increases in the price of raw materials energy and transportation including due to climate change could harm our profits 

we use many different raw materials for our business particularly natural products including essential oils extracts and concentrates derived from fruits vegetables flowers woods and other botanicals animal products raw fruits organic chemicals and petroleumbased chemicals as well as in connection with the nb business gelatin glycols cellulose processed grains including dextrose and glucose guar locust bean gum organic vegetable oils peels saccharides seaweed soybeans and sugars and yeasts we have experienced price volatility with respect to raw materials for example there has been industrywide price volatility of certain ingredients used in fragrance compounds due to the basf incident in 2019 and 2020 we experienced increases in the prices of certain naturals in addition in connection with the outbreak of covid19 we may experience price volatility of certain raw materials as a result of restrictions on travel and movement and other measures enacted by countries around the world to contain the spread of covid19 

natural products represent approximately sixty percent of our raw material spend and we expect such volatility to continue in the near future in addition because we offer a substantial number of natural product offerings and often rely on a limited number of suppliers for certain products this risk may be exacerbated there is growing evidence that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures weather and precipitation patterns growing and harvesting conditions and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters such as floods wildfires droughts and water scarcity to the extent such climate change effects have a negative impact on crop size and quality it could impact the availability and pricing of these natural products if we are unable to increase the prices to our customers of our products to offset raw material and other input cost increases or if we are unable to achieve cost savings to offset such cost increases we could fail to meet our cost expectations and our profits and operating results could be adversely affected increases in prices of our products to customers may lead to declines in sales volumes and we may not be able to accurately predict the volume impact of price increases which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

similarly synthetic commodities dependent on oil feedstock are affected by climate policies and energy production restrictions and pricing energy prices are subject to significant volatility caused by among other things market fluctuations supply and demand prices are subject to significant volatility caused by among other things market fluctuations supply and demand currency fluctuations production and transportation disruptions climate change and weather conditions and other world events as we source many of our raw materials globally to help ensure quality control if the cost of energy shipping or transportation increases and we are unable to timely and fully pass along these costs to our customers our profit margins would be adversely affected in connection with our combination with the nb business a majority of the revenue generated by nb business’s former pharma solutions segment and to a lesser extent the nb’s former food  beverage and health  biosciences segments is pursuant to contracts which are subject to renewal annually or allow price to be adjusted annually 

under certain circumstances including changes in raw material costs furthermore increasing our prices to our customers could result in longterm sales declines or loss of market share if our customers find alternative suppliers or choose to reformulate their consumer products to use fewer ingredients which could have an adverse longterm impact on our results of operations our ability to price our products competitively to timely reflect volatility in prices of raw material and ingredients is critical to maintain and grow our sales to mitigate our sourcing risk we maintain strategic stock levels for critical items however if we do not accurately estimate the amount of raw materials that will be used for the geographic region in which we will need these materials or competitively price our products our margins could be adversely affected 

a significant data breach or other disruption to our information technology systems could disrupt our operations result in the loss of confidential information or personal data and adversely impact our reputation business or results of operations 

we rely on information technology systems including some managed by thirdparty providers to conduct business and support our business processes including those relating to product formulas product development manufacturing sales order and invoice processing production distribution internal communications and communications with third parties throughout the world processing transactions summarizing and reporting results of operations complying with regulatory tax or legal requirements and collecting and storing customer supplier employee and other stakeholder information cyber security incidents data breaches and operational disruptions are constantly evolving becoming more sophisticated and are conducted by groups and individuals with a wide range of expertise and motives including foreign governments cyber terrorists cyber criminals and malicious employees and other insiders and outsiders we and our thirdparty providers are subject to risks posed by such incidents which can take many forms including code anomalies “acts of god” data leakage hardware or software failures human error cyber extortion password theft or introduction of viruses malware and ransomware including through phishing emails 

a disruption to our information technology systems could result in the loss of confidential business customer supplier or employee information litigation or fines and may require substantial investigations repairs or replacements or impact our ability to summarize and report financial results in a timely manner resulting in significant financial legal and relational costs and potentially harming our reputation and adversely impacting our operations customer service and results of operations as we work on upgrading and integrating nb’s and frutarom’s systems these risks may be exacerbated additionally a security or data breach could require us to devote significant management and financial resources to address the problems created and as a result of the private rights of action provided for under the eu’s general data protection regulation the “gdpr” the california consumer privacy act the “ccpa” and other laws relating to data protection and privacy in other jurisdictions in the event of such breaches additional private litigation against us may result these types of adverse impacts could also occur in the event the confidentiality integrity or availability of company customer supplier or employee information are compromised due to a data loss by us or a trusted third party we or the third parties with which we share information may not discover any such incidents and loss of information for a significant period of time after the incident occurs in addition as a result of covid19 we are facing increased operational challenges as we take measures to support and protect employee health and safety including implementing workfromhome policies for employees in particular our remote work arrangements coupled with stayathome orders may pose challenges for our employees and our it systems and extended periods of remote work arrangements could introduce operational risk including cybersecurity and it systems management risks although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and customer data and to prevent data loss and other security breaches and expect to continue to expend additional resources to bolster these protections these security measures cannot provide absolute security and we may be unable to detect or prevent a breach or disruption in the future additionally while we have insurance coverage designed to address certain aspects of cyber risks in place such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise 

we have made investments in and continue to expand our business into emerging markets which exposes us to certain risks 

as part of our growth strategy we have increased our presence in emerging markets by expanding our manufacturing presence sales organization and product offerings in these markets and we expect to continue to expand our business in these markets with our acquisition of frutarom in 2018 and the closing of the nb transaction in february 2021 each of which also had a significant presence in emerging markets our business in these markets has meaningfully grown in addition to the currency and international risks described below our operations in these markets may be subject to a variety of other risks emerging markets typically have a consumer base with limited or fluctuating disposable income and customer demand in these markets may fluctuate accordingly as a result decrease in customer demand in emerging markets may have an adverse effect on our ability to execute our growth strategy 

further there is no assurance that our existing products variants of our existing products or new products that we make manufacture distribute or sell will be accepted or be successful in any particular developing or emerging market due to local or global competition product price cultural differences consumer preferences or otherwise in addition emerging markets may have weak legal systems which may affect our ability to enforce our intellectual property and contractual rights exchange 

controls unstable governments and privatization or other government actions that may affect taxes subsidies and incentive programs and the flow of goods and currency in conducting our business we move products from one country to another and may provide services in one country from a subsidiary located in another country accordingly we are vulnerable to abrupt changes in trade customs and tax regimes in these markets if we are unable to expand our business in developing and emerging markets effectively operate or manage the risks associated with operating in these markets or achieve the return on capital we expect from our investments in these markets our operating results and future growth could be adversely affected 

the impact of currency fluctuation or devaluation in the international markets in which we operate may negatively affect our results of operations 

we have significant operations outside the us the results of which are reported in the local currency and then translated into us dollars at applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements the exchange rates between these currencies and the us dollar have fluctuated and will continue to do so in the future for example as of july 1 2018 we concluded that argentina’s economy is highly inflationary under us gaap as it has experienced cumulative inflation of approximately 100 or more over a threeyear period while our current operations in argentina represent less than 3 of our consolidated net sales and less than 1 of our consolidated total assets continuing inflation in argentina could adversely affect our profitability in a specific period changes in exchange rates between these local currencies and the us dollar will affect the recorded levels of sales profitability assets andor liabilities additionally volatility in currency exchange rates may adversely impact our financial condition cash flows or liquidity although we employ a variety of techniques to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations including sourcing strategies and a limited number of foreign currency hedging activities we cannot guarantee that such hedging and risk management strategies will be effective and our results of operations could be adversely affected 

international economic political legal compliance and business factors could negatively affect our financial statements operations and growth 

we operate on a global basis with manufacturing and sales facilities in or supply arrangements with companies based in the us europe africa the middle east latin america and greater asia during 2020 approximately 80 of our combined net sales were to customers outside the us and we intend to continue expansion of our international operations as a result our business is increasingly exposed to risks inherent in international operations these risks which can vary substantially by location include the following 

• governmental laws regulations and policies adopted to manage national economic and macroeconomic conditions such as increases in taxes austerity measures that may impact consumer spending monetary policies that may impact inflation rates employment regulations currency fluctuations or controls and sustainability of resources 

• changes in environmental health and safety regulations such as regulations related to biodiversity or the continued implementation and evolution of the european union’s reach regulations and similar regulations that are being evaluated and adopted in other markets and the burdens and costs of our compliance with such regulations which may differ significantly across jurisdictions 

• increased environmental health and safety regulations or the loss of necessary environmental permits in certain countries 

• increased product labeling and ingredient prohibitions in specific markets that may impact consumer preference products costs andor customer acceptance 

• the imposition of or changes in customs tariffs quotas trade barriers other trade protection measures import or export licensing requirements and sanctions on trade with certain countries imposed by the us or other countries which could adversely affect our cost or ability to import raw materials or export our products to surrounding markets 

• risks and costs arising from our ability to cater to local demand and customer preferences language and cultural differences 

• changes in the laws and policies that govern foreign investment in the countries in which we operate including the risk of expropriation or nationalization the costs and ability to repatriate the profit that we generate in these countries 

• risks and costs associated with complying with antimoney laundering and counterterrorism financing laws 

• risks and costs associated with political and economic instability bribery and corruption antiamerican sentiment and social and ethnic unrest in the countries in which we operate 

• difficulty in recruiting and retaining trained local personnel 

• natural disasters global or local health crisis pandemics such as the covid19 pandemic epidemics or international conflicts including terrorist acts political crisis national and regional labor strikes in the countries in which we operate which could endanger our personnel interrupt our operations or adversely affect the demand for our products the results of certain regions or our global supply chain or 

• the risks of operating in developing or emerging markets in which there are significant uncertainties regarding the interpretation application and enforceability of laws and regulations and the enforceability of contract rights and intellectual property rights 

the occurrence of any one or more of these factors could increase our costs and adversely affect our results of operations 

economic uncertainty may adversely affect demand for our products which may have a negative impact on our operating results and future growth 

our products are a subset of a wide assortment of global consumer products throughout the world historically demand for consumer products using our products such as flavors and fragrance compounds and ingredients was stimulated and broadened by changing social habits and consumer needs population growth an expanding global middleclass and general economic growth especially in emerging markets however impacts of the ongoing covid19 pandemic have resulted in increased volatility and economic uncertainty and may lead to significant negative impacts on consumer spending demand for our products the ability for our customers to pay or our suppliers to supply our financial condition and the financial condition of our suppliers or customers it is currently anticipated that these challenging economic uncertainties will continue to affect certain of our markets during 2021 which could adversely affect our sales profitability and overall operating results even prior to covid19 the global economy had experienced significant recessionary pressures and declines in consumer confidence and economic growth the predictions surrounding the global recessionary economic environment has and may in the near future increase unemployment and underemployment decrease salaries and wage rates increase inflation or result in other marketwide cost pressures that will adversely affect demand for consumer products in both developed and emerging markets in addition growth rates in the emerging markets have moderated from previous levels reduced consumer spending may cause changes in our customer orders including reduced demand for our flavors and fragrances compounds or ingredients or order cancellations the timing of placing of orders and the amounts of these orders are generally at our customers’ discretion customers may cancel reduce or postpone orders with us on relatively short notice significant cancellations reductions or delays in orders by customers could affect our quarterly results 

increasing awareness of health and wellness are driving changes in the consumer products industry and if we are unable to react in a timely and costeffective manner our results of operations and future growth may be adversely affected 

we must continually anticipate and react in a timely and costeffective manner to changes in consumer preferences and demands including changes in demand driven by increasing awareness of health and wellness and demands for transparency or cleaner labels with respect to product ingredients by consumers and regulators consumers especially in developed economies such as the us and western europe are rapidly shifting away from products containing artificial ingredients to allnatural healthier alternatives in addition there has been a growing demand by consumers nongovernmental organizations and to a lesser extent governmental agencies to provide more transparency in product labeling and our customers have been taking steps to address this demand including by voluntarily providing productspecific ingredients disclosure these two trends could affect the types and volumes of our ingredients and compounds that our customers include in their consumer product offerings and therefore affect the demand for our products if we are unable to react to or anticipate these trends in a timely and costeffective manner our results of operations and future growth may be adversely affected 

we are subject to increasing customer consumer shareholder and regulatory focus on sustainability which may result in additional costs in order to meet new requirements or integrate the nb business and frutarom with our sustainability practices 

federal state local and foreign governments our customers and consumers are becoming increasingly sensitive to environmental and other sustainability issues in response we have committed to a sustainability strategy through which we continue to assess our combined environmental footprint following the nb transaction and the frutarom acquisition with the intent of identifying synergies gaps and opportunities in our sustainability efforts 

as part of our assessment so far we have been upgrading frutarom’s sustainability practices to better align them to our legacy iff practices and we have begun integrating the nb business’ practices both of which may require significant costs and time to implement our assessment may reveal additional gaps between the nb business or frutarom operations on the one hand and our sustainability practices and goals on the other hand which may require significant costs to remedy 

despite our efforts the increased focus on sustainability may result in new regulations and customer requirements that could affect us these could cause us to incur additional direct costs or to make changes to our operations in order to comply with any new regulations and customer requirements we could also lose revenue if our customers divert business from us because we have not complied with their sustainability requirements or if we are not successful in integrating nb business’ and frutarom’s sustainability metrics these potential costs changes and loss of revenue could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our performance may be adversely impacted if we are not successful in managing our inventory andor working capital balances 

we evaluate our inventory balances of materials based on shelf life expected sourcing levels known uses and anticipated demand based on forecasted customer order activity and changes in our productsales mix efficient inventory management is a key component of our business success financial returns and profitability to be successful we must maintain sufficient inventory levels and an appropriate productsales mix to meet our customers’ demands without allowing those levels to increase to such an extent that the costs associated with storing and holding other inventory adversely impact our financial results if our buying decisions do not accurately predict sourcing levels customer trends or our expectations about customer needs are inaccurate we may have to take unanticipated markdowns or impairment charges to dispose of the excess or obsolete inventory which can adversely impact our financial results additionally we believe excess inventory levels of raw materials with a short shelf life in our manufacturing facilities subjects us to the risk of increased inventory shrinkage if we are not successful in managing our inventory balances and shrinkage our results of and cash flows from operations may be negatively affected 

we sell certain accounts receivable on a nonrecourse basis to unrelated financial institutions under “factoring” agreements that are sponsored solely and individually by certain customers the cost of participating in these programs was immaterial to our results in all periods should we choose not to participate or if these programs were no longer available it could reduce our cash flows from operations in the period in which the arrangement ends 

any impairment of our tangible or intangible longlived assets including goodwill may adversely impact our profitability 

a significant portion of our assets consists of longlived assets including tangible assets such as our manufacturing facilities and intangible assets including goodwill 

as a result of our recent acquisitions including the 2018 acquisition of frutarom as of december 31 2020 we had recorded approximately 83 billion of intangible assets and goodwill including 43 billion of goodwill associated with the acquisition of frutarom the nb transaction will add approximately 205 billion of goodwill and other intangible assets to iff’s consolidated balance sheet our results of operations and financial position in future periods could be negatively impacted should future impairments of our longlived assets including intangible assets or goodwill occur 

at least annually we assess both goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment we test for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value we record an impairment charge based on the difference of the two intangible assets with finite lives are also tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable such events and changes in circumstances could include a sustained decrease in our market capitalization increased competition or unexpected loss of market share increased input costs beyond projections for example due to regulatory or industry changes our inability to recognize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions unexpected business disruptions for example due to a natural disaster public health crises such as pandemics or epidemics or loss of a customer supplier or other significant business relationship acts by governments and courts operating results falling short of projections or significant adverse changes in the markets in which we operate 

fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions estimates and market factors estimating the fair value of reporting units requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our business performance future plans future annual net cash flows income tax considerations discount rates growth rates and based on industry economic regulatory conditions and other market factors moreover management will make significant accounting judgments and estimates for the application of acquisition accounting under gaap and the underlying valuation models iff’s business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted in future periods if iff’s accounting judgments and estimates related to these models prove to be inaccurate 

to the extent any of our acquisitions including the acquisitions of frutarom and the nb business do not perform as anticipated and our underlying assumptions and estimates related to their fair value determination are not met whether due to internal or external factors the value of such assets may be negatively affected and we may be required to record impairment charges 

our funding obligations for our pension and postretirement plans could adversely affect our earnings and cash flows 

the funding obligations for our pension plans are impacted by the performance of the financial markets particularly the equity markets and interest rates funding obligations are determined under government regulations and are measured each year based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date if the financial markets do not provide the longterm returns that are expected under the governmental funding calculations we could be required to make larger contributions the equity markets can be very volatile and therefore our estimate of future contribution requirements can change dramatically in relatively short periods of time similarly changes in interest rates and legislation enacted by governmental authorities can impact the timing and amounts of contribution requirements an adverse change in the funded status of the plans could significantly increase our required contributions in the future and adversely impact our liquidity 

assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans are determined by us in consultation with outside consultants and advisors in the event that we determine that changes are warranted in the assumptions used such as the discount rate expected longterm rate of return on assets or expected health care costs our future pension and postretirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease due to changing market conditions or changes in the participant population the assumptions that we use may differ from actual results which could have a significant impact on our pension and postretirement liabilities and related costs and funding requirements 

the expected phase out of the london interbank office rate “libor” could impact the interest rates paid on our variable rate indebtedness and cause our interest expense to increase 

in 2017 the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority which regulates libor announced that it intends to phase out libor by the end of 2021 currently there is no definitive information regarding the future utilization of libor or of any particular replacement rate borrowings under our revolving credit and term loan facilities are at variable interest rates based on libor although our revolving credit and term loan facilities include mechanics to facilitate the adoption by us and our lenders of an alternative benchmark rate in place of libor no assurance can be made that such alternative rate will perform in a manner similar to libor and may result in interest rates that are higher or lower than those that would have resulted had libor remained in effect 

our business may be negatively impacted as a result of the united kingdom’s departure from the european union 

we currently manufacture goods in the united kingdom for distribution in the european union and viceversa and therefore may be adversely affected as a result of the united kingdom’s departure from the european union “brexit” in 2020 the impact of the withdrawal could among other outcomes exacerbate the disruption of the free movement of goods services and people between the united kingdom and the european union undermine bilateral cooperation in key geographic areas and significantly disrupt trade between the united kingdom and the european union or other nations as the united kingdom pursues independent trade relations in addition brexit has caused legal uncertainty which could last indefinitely and may potentially create divergent national laws and regulations as the united kingdom determines which european union laws to replace or replicate given the lack of comparable precedent it is unclear what the financial trade and legal implications of the withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union will be and how the withdrawal will affect us adverse consequences concerning brexit or the european union could include deterioration in global economic conditions instability in global financial markets political uncertainty volatility in currency exchange rates or adverse changes in the crossborder agreements currently in place any of which could have an adverse impact on our financial results in the future 

risks related to legal and regulatory considerations 

if we are unable to comply with regulatory requirements and industry standards including those regarding product safety quality efficacy and environmental impact we could incur significant costs and suffer reputational harm which could adversely affect results of operations 

the development manufacture and sale of our products are subject to various regulatory requirements in each of the countries in which our products are developed manufactured and sold in addition we are subject to product safety and compliance requirements established by governments nongovernmental organizations including industry or similar oversight bodies or contractually by our customers including requirements concerning product safety quality and efficacy environmental impacts including packaging energy and water use and waste management and other sustainability or similar issues changes to regulations or the implementation of additional regulations especially in certain highly regulated markets served by us following the nb transaction such as regulatory modernization of food safety laws and evolving standards and regulations affecting pharmaceutical excipients microbials or in reaction to new or nextgeneration technologies including advances in protein engineering gene editing and gene mapping or novel uses of existing technologies has required and may in the future require us to reduce or remove certain ingredients substances or processing aids from the product portfolio and may result in significant costs or capital expenditures or require changes in business practice that could result in reduced margins or profitability we use a variety of strategies methodologies and tools to minimize the likelihood of product or process non 

compliance with these regulations and standards by i monitoring regulatory developments and current product standards ii assessing relative risks in our supply chain iii monitoring internal and external performance and iv testing raw materials and finished goods as concerns regarding safety quality and environmental impact become more pressing we may see new more restrictive regulations adopted that impact our products for example the european chemicals agency has proposed that the european commission adopt a ban on microplastics including those found in personal care items detergents and cosmetics to reduce plastics pollution if this ban is adopted we will be required to modify our products andor innovate new solutions to replace microplastics in our products if we are unable to adapt to these new regulations or standards in a cost effective and timely manner we may lose business to competitors who are able to provide compliant products 

gaps in our operational processes or those of our suppliers or distributors can result in products that do not meet our quality control or industry standards or fail to comply with the relevant regulatory requirements which in turn can result in finished consumer goods that do not comply with applicable standards and requirements products that are mislabeled contaminated or damaged could result in a regulatory noncompliance event or even a product recall by the fda or a similar foreign agency our contracts often require us to indemnify our customers for the costs associated with a product noncompliance event including penalties costs and settlements arising from litigation remediation costs or loss of sales as our flavors and fragrance compounds and ingredients and our nutrition and health food and beverage and pharma offerings are used in many products intended for human use or consumption these consequences would be exacerbated if we or our customer did not identify the defect before the product reaches the consumer and there was a resulting impact at the consumer level such a result could lead to potentially largescale adverse publicity negative effects on consumer’s health recalls and potential litigation fines penalties sanctions or other regulatory actions in addition if we do not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification from suppliers or other third parties or if insurance or indemnification is not available the liability relating to product or possible thirdparty claims arising from mislabeled contaminated or damaged products could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations furthermore adverse publicity about our products or our customers’ products that contain our ingredients including concerns about product safety or similar issues whether real or perceived could harm our reputation and result in an immediate adverse effect on our sales and customer relationships as well as require us to utilize significant resources to rebuild our reputation 

failure to comply with environmental protection laws may cause us to close relocate or operate one or more of our plants at reduced production levels and expose us to civil or criminal liability which could adversely affect our operating results and future growth 

our business operations and properties procure make use of manufacture sell and distribute substances that are sometimes considered hazardous and are therefore subject to extensive and increasingly stringent federal state local and foreign laws and regulations pertaining to protection of the environment including air emissions sewage discharges the use of hazardous materials waste disposal practices and cleanup of existing environmental contamination 

failure to comply with these laws and regulations or any future changes to them may result in significant consequences to us including the need to close or relocate one or more of our production facilities administrative civil and criminal penalties fines sanctions litigation costly remediation measures liability for damages and negative publicity if we are unable to meet production requirements we can lose customer orders which can adversely affect our future growth or we may be required to make incremental capital investments to ensure supply for example we recently completed negotiations with the chinese government concerning the relocation of a second fragrance facility in china idling of facilities or production modifications has caused or may cause customers to seek alternate suppliers due to concerns regarding supply interruptions and these customers may not return or may order at reduced levels even once issues are remediated if these noncompliance issues reoccur in china or occur or in any other jurisdiction we may lose business and may be required to incur capital spending above previous expectations close a plant or operate a plant at significantly reduced production levels on a permanent basis and our operating results and cash flows from operations may be adversely affected 

we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act or similar us or foreign antibribery and anticorruption laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate 

the global nature of our business the significance of our international revenue and our focus on emerging markets create various domestic and local regulatory challenges and subject us to risks associated with our international operations the us foreign corrupt practices act or fcpa and similar antibribery and anticorruption laws and regulations in other countries generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or for other commercial advantage in addition us public companies are required to maintain records that accurately and fairly represent their transactions and have an adequate system of internal accounting controls under the fcpa us companies may be held liable for the corrupt actions taken by directors officers employees agents or other strategic or local partners or representatives as such if we or our intermediaries fail to comply with the requirements of the fcpa or similar legislation governmental authorities in the us and elsewhere could seek to impose substantial civil andor criminal fines and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation operating results and financial condition 

we operate or may pursue opportunities in some jurisdictions such as china india brazil russia and africa that pose potentially elevated risks of fraud or corruption or increased risk of internal control issues in certain jurisdictions compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices from time to time we have conducted and will conduct internal investigations of the relevant facts and circumstances control testing and compliance reviews and take remedial actions when appropriate to help ensure that we are in compliance with applicable corruption and similar laws and regulations for example in august 2019 during the integration of frutarom we were made aware of allegations that two frutarom businesses operating principally in russia and ukraine made certain improper payments including to representatives of a number of customers our investigation substantiated the allegations that improper payments to representatives of customers were made and that key members of frutarom’s senior management at the time were aware of such payments we did not uncover any evidence suggesting that such payments had any connection to the us in addition frutarom grew through rapid acquisition and as part of our integration efforts we have implemented our anti corruption and similar policies throughout a number of those acquired companies many of which were not previously subject to these us laws 

detecting investigating and resolving actual or alleged violations of the fcpa or other antibribery and anticorruption laws and regulations is expensive could consume significant time and attention of our senior management and could subject us to investigations and inquiries by governmental and other regulatory bodies any allegations of non compliance with such laws and regulations could have a disruptive effect on our operations in such jurisdiction including interruptions of business or loss of thirdparty relationships which may negatively impact our results of operations or financial condition any determination that our operations or activities are not in compliance with such laws and regulations could expose us to severe criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions significant fines termination of necessary licenses and permits and penalties or other sanctions that may harm our business and reputation 

defects quality issues inadequate disclosure or misuse with respect to the products and capabilities could adversely affect our business reputation and results of operations 

defects in misuse of quality issues with respect to or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to our products could lead to lost profits and other economic damage property damage personal injury or other liability resulting in thirdparty claims criminal liability significant costs damage to our reputation and loss of business any of these factors could adversely affect our business financial condition and our results of operations 

our ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights 

we rely on patents trademarks copyrights and trade secrets to protect our intellectual property rights we often rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary fragrance and flavor formulations as well as our manufacturing processes extract methodologies and processes for our nutrition natural colors for food and natural antioxidants for food protection as this does not require us to publicly file information regarding our intellectual property from time to time a third party may claim that we have infringed upon or misappropriated their intellectual property rights or a third party may infringe upon or misappropriate our intellectual property rights we could incur significant costs in connection with legal actions to assert our intellectual property rights against third parties or to defend ourselves from thirdparty assertions of invalidity infringement misappropriation or other claims any settlement or adverse judgment resulting from such litigation could require us to obtain a license to continue to use the intellectual property rights that are the subject of the claim or otherwise restrict or prohibit our use of such intellectual property rights any required licensing fees may not be available to us on acceptable terms if at all for those intellectual property rights that are protected as trade secrets this litigation could result in even higher costs and potentially the loss of certain rights since we would not have a perfected intellectual property right that precludes others from making using or selling our products or processes the ongoing trend among our customers towards more transparent labeling could further diminish our ability to effectively protect our proprietary flavor formulations 

we vigilantly protect our intellectual property rights including trade secrets we have designed and implemented internal controls intended to restrict access to and distribution of our respective intellectual property despite these precautions our intellectual property is vulnerable to unauthorized access through employee error or actions theft and cybersecurity incidents and other security breaches protecting intellectual property related to biotechnology is particularly challenging because theft is difficult to detect and biotechnology can be selfreplicating accordingly the impact of such theft can be significant 

for intellectual property rights that we seek to protect through patents we cannot be certain that these rights if obtained will not later be opposed invalidated or circumvented in addition even if such rights are obtained in the us the laws of some of the other countries in which our products are or may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us if other parties were to infringe on our intellectual property rights or if our intellectual property rights were the subject of unauthorized access leading to competitive pressure or if a third party successfully asserted that we had infringed on their intellectual property rights it could materially and adversely affect our future results of operations by among other things i being required to cease production and marketing or reducing the price that we could obtain in the marketplace for products which are based on such rights ii increasing the royalty or other fees that we may be required to pay 

in connection with such rights iii limiting the volume if any of such products that we can sell or iv resulting in significant litigation costs and potential liability 

our results of operations may be negatively impacted by the outcome of uncertainties related to litigation 

from time to time we are involved in a number of legal claims regulatory investigations and litigation including claims related to intellectual property product liability environmental matters and indirect taxes for instance product liability claims may arise due to the fact that we supply flavors and fragrances to the food and beverage functional food pharmanutraceutical and personal care industries our manufacturing and other facilities may expose us to environmental claims and regulatory investigations in addition as we expand our product offering into functional food nutraceuticals and natural antioxidants we may also be subject to claims of false or deceptive advertising claims in the us europe and other foreign jurisdictions in which we offer these types of products these claims can arise as a result of function claims health claims nutrient content claims and other claims that impermissibly suggest therapeutic benefits for certain foods or food components the cost of defending these claims or our obligations for direct damages and indemnification if we were found liable could adversely affect our results of operations 

as a result of the nb transaction and the frutarom acquisition we assumed legal or environmental claims regulatory investigations and litigation including product liability patent infringement commercial litigation and other actions and we may become involved in additional actions in the future arising from the acquired operations specifically as the nb business and frutarom had a significant number of facilities located globally and a large number of customers our exposure to legal claims regulatory and environmental investigations and litigation may increase this could result in an increase in our cost for defense or settlement of claims or indemnification obligations if we were to be found liable in excess of our historical experience 

in addition we are also the subject of a putative shareholder class action lawsuit filed in august 2019 after we disclosed that preliminary results of investigations indicated that frutarom businesses operating principally in russia and ukraine had made improper payments to representatives of customers 

our insurance may not be adequate to protect us from all material expenses related to pending and future claims and our current levels of insurance may not be available in the future at commercially reasonable prices any of these factors could adversely affect our profitability and results of operations 

changes in our tax rates the adoption of new us or international tax legislation or changes in existing tax laws could expose us to additional tax liabilities that may affect our future results 

we are subject to taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in liabilities for uncertain tax positions cost of repatriations or changes in tax laws or their interpretation any of these changes could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 

we have and will continue to implement transfer pricing policies among our various operations located in different countries these transfer pricing policies are a significant component of the management and compliance of our operations across international boundaries and overall financial results many countries routinely examine transfer pricing policies of taxpayers subject to their jurisdiction challenge transfer pricing policies aggressively where there is potential noncompliance and impose significant interest charges and penalties where noncompliance is determined however governmental authorities could challenge these policies more aggressively in the future and if challenged we may not prevail we could suffer significant costs related to one or more challenges to our transfer pricing policies 

we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service state tax authorities and foreign tax authorities in those countries in which we operate and we may be subject to assessments or audits in the future in any of the countries in which we operate the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals and while we do not believe the results that follow would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition such results could have a material effect on our income tax provision net income or cash flows in the period or periods in which that determination is made 

in addition a number of international legislative and regulatory bodies have proposed legislation and begun investigations of the tax practices of multinational companies and in the european union the tax policies of certain european union member states one of these efforts has been led by the organization for economic cooperation and development an international association of 34 countries including the us which has finalized recommendations to revise corporate tax transfer pricing and tax treaty provisions in member countries since 2013 the european commission “ec” has been investigating tax rulings granted by tax authorities in a number of european union member states with respect to specific multinational corporations to determine whether such rulings comply with european union rules on state aid as well as more recent investigations of the tax regimes of certain european union member states under european union law selective tax advantages for particular taxpayers that are not sufficiently grounded in economic realities may constitute impermissible state aid if the ec determines that a tax 

ruling or tax regime violates the state aid restrictions the tax authorities of the affected european union member state may be required to collect back taxes for the period of time covered by the ruling in late 2015 and early 2016 the ec declared that tax rulings related to other companies by tax authorities in luxembourg the netherlands and belgium did not comply with the european union state aid restrictions if the ec or tax authorities in other jurisdictions were to successfully challenge tax rulings applicable to us in any of the member states in which we are subject to taxation or our internal intercompany arrangements we could be exposed to increased tax liabilities 

in december 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” that significantly revised the us tax code effective january 1 2018 by among other things lowering the corporate income tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35 to a flat 21 limiting deductibility of interest expense and performance based incentive compensation transitioning to a territorial system and creating new taxes associated with global operations the tax act impacted our consolidated results of operations during 2020 and is expected to continue to impact our consolidated results of operations in future periods in future periods we expect that our effective tax rate will be impacted by the lower us corporate tax rate that will initially be offset by the elimination of the deductibility of performancebased incentive compensation and other provisions of the tax act that may impact us prospectively however the ultimate impact of the tax act will depend on additional regulatory or accounting guidance that may be issued with respect to the tax act and any operating and structural changes that we may undertake to permit us to benefit from the new lower us tax rate prospectively this could adversely affect our results of operations 

the nb transaction could result in significant tax liability and we may be obligated to indemnify dupont for any such tax liability imposed on dupont 

the completion of the nb transaction was conditioned upon the receipt by dupont of an opinion that the transaction generally will qualify as a taxfree reorganization the tax opinion was based upon various factual representations and assumptions as well as certain undertakings made by dupont us and nb if any of those factual representations or assumptions were untrue or incomplete in any material respect any undertaking was or is not complied with or the facts upon which the opinion was based are materially different from the facts at the closing of the nb transaction the transaction may not qualify in whole or part for taxfree treatment 

the nb spinoff and certain aspects of the prespinoff internal reorganizations to form nb could be taxable to dupont if nb or we were to engage in a “spinco tainting act” as defined in the tax matters agreement by and among dupont nb and iff a form of which is attached to iff’s registration statement on form s4 registration number 333238072 a spinco tainting act is generally any action or inaction within our control or under the control of nb or their affiliates any event involving our common stock or the common stock of nb or any assets of nb or its subsidiaries or any breach by nb or any of its subsidiaries of any factual representations assumptions or undertakings made by it in each case that would affect the nonrecognition treatment of the spinoff and internal reorganizations for us federal income tax purposes as described above under the tax matters agreement we and nb will be required to indemnify dupont for any taxes resulting from a spinco tainting act if we or nb were required to indemnify dupont pursuant to the tax matters agreement as described above this indemnification obligation may be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on us including with respect to its financial condition and results of operations 

if we fail to comply with data protection laws in the us and abroad we may be subject to fines penalties and other costs 

legal requirements relating to the collection storage handling use disclosure transfer and security of personal data continue to evolve and regulatory scrutiny in this area is increasing around the world this regulatory environment is increasingly challenging and may present material obligations and risks to our business including significantly expanded compliance burdens restrictions on transfer of personal data costs and enforcement risks for example the european union’s gdpr which became effective in may 2018 greatly increases the jurisdictional reach of eu law and adds a broad array of requirements related to personal data including individual notice and optout preferences restrictions on and requirements for transfer of personal data and the public disclosure of significant data breaches additionally violations of the gdpr can result in fines of as much as 4 of a company’s annual revenue other governments have enacted or are enacting similar data protection laws including data localization laws that require data to stay within their borders all of these evolving compliance and operational requirements restrictions on use of personal data as well as the uncertain interpretation and enforcement of laws impose significant costs and regulatory risks that are likely to increase over time our failure to comply with these evolving regulations could expose us to fines sanctions penalties and other costs that could harm our reputation and adversely impact our financial results

for 2020 revenue was largely flat but this overall performance reflected strength in consumer fragrances offset by declines in fine fragrances and most taste categories especially those in the food service area the impact that covid19 will have on our consolidated results of operations in 2021 remains uncertain based on the length and severity of covid19 we experience continued volatility as a result of retail and travel consumer shopping and consumption behavior we will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of these potential impacts to our business consolidated results of operations segment results liquidity and capital resources 

although iff does not currently anticipate any impairment charges related to covid19 the continuing effects of a prolonged pandemic could result in increased risk of asset writedowns and impairments including but not limited to equity investments goodwill and intangibles any of these events could potentially result in a material adverse impact on iff’s business and results of operations

for a reconciliation between reported and adjusted figures please refer to the nongaap financial measures section 

sales 

sales in 2020 decreased 1 on a reported basis and were flat on a currency neutral basis which excludes the effects of changes in currency by restating exchange ratios in effect for the current year based on the currency of the underlying transaction scent sales increased 2 on a reported basis and 3 on a currency neutral basis taste sales decreased 3 on a reported basis and 2 on a currency neutral basis the change in consolidated reported and currency neutral sales was driven by strength in consumer fragrances and a slight increase in fragrance ingredients offset by volume reductions in most taste product categories and fine fragrances the yearonyear declines in sales of many product categories was partially due to travel and shelterinplace restrictions in certain regions as a result of covid19 the additional week of sales or a 53rd week in 2019 also contributed to the yearonyear decline in sales 

exchange rate variations had an unfavorable impact on net sales for 2020 of approximately 1 the effect of exchange rates can vary by business and region depending upon the mix of sales priced in us dollars as compared to other currencies 

our 25 largest customers accounted for approximately 39 of total sales in 2020 in 2020 no customer accounted for more than 10 of sales a key factor for commercial success is our inclusion on strategic customers’ core supplier lists which provides opportunities to expand and win new business we are on the core supplier lists of a large majority of our global and strategic customers within taste and scent 

gross margin 

gross margin decreased to 410 in 2020 from 411 in 2019 principally driven by unfavorable price versus input costs and mix and sales volume reductions on existing business due principally to covid19 largely offset by the impact of productivity integration and cross selling initiatives 

operating profit 

operating profit decreased 988 million to 5665 million 111 of sales in 2020 compared to 6653 million 129 of sales in 2019 foreign currency had a 2 unfavorable impact on operating profit in both the 2020 and 2019 periods adjusted operating profit was 7297 million 144 of sales for 2020 a decrease from 7931 million 154 of sales for 2019 principally driven by unfavorable price versus input costs and mix and sales volume reductions on existing business due principally to covid19 partially offset by the impact of productivity integration and cross selling initiatives

2020 in comparison to 2019 

sales 

sales for 2020 totaled 51 billion which decreased 1 on a reported basis and flat on a currency neutral basis as compared to the prior year sales performance for the scent segment reflected growth in consumer fragrances and a slight increase in fragrance ingredients offset by declines in fine fragrances through the first nine months of 2020 in the fourth quarter of 2020 fine fragrances saw a slight increase in sales when compared to the comparable period of the prior year sales performance for the taste segment reflected reduced sales in most taste categories especially those related to retail food services 

sales performance by segment was as follows 



 

1 currency neutral sales growth is calculated by translating prior year sales at the exchange rates for the corresponding 2020 period 

taste sales 

taste sales in 2020 decreased 3 on a reported basis and 2 on a currency neutral basis versus the prior year period performance was primarily driven by sales declines in all regions except north america primarily from volume reductions due to reduced consumer demand principally related to the covid19 pandemic partially offset by new win performances net of losses 

scent sales 

scent sales in 2020 increased 2 on a reported basis and 3 on a currency neutral basis sales growth in the scent business unit was led by consumer fragrances primarily driven by new win performances net of losses and volume increases in most product offerings such as fabric and home care items to support consumer demand related to the covid19 pandemic fragrance ingredients also contributed to a slight increase in the growth of the scent business unit primarily driven by volume increases offset by price reductions performance in the scent business unit was offset by fine fragrances through the first nine months of 2020 primarily driven by volume reductions caused by the disruption of consumer access to retail markets due to covid19 however in the fourth quarter of 2020 fine fragrances sales grew slightly compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 primarily driven by new win performances net of losses offset by volume reductions 

cost of goods sold 

cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales increased to 590 in 2020 compared to 589 in 2019 

research and development rd 

overall rd expenses as a percentage of sales increased to 70 in 2020 compared to 67 in 2019 

selling and administrative sa 

sa expenses increased 727 million to 9488 million or 187 as a percentage of sales in 2020 compared to 8761 million or 170 as a percentage of sales in 2019 adjusted sa expense increased by 198 million to 8087 million 159 as a percentage of sales in 2020 compared to 7889 million 153 as a percentage of sales in 2019 the increase in sa expenses was due to higher employee related expenses including bonuses to essential workers in 2020 and incentive compensation 

restructuring and other charges 

restructuring and other charges decreased to 173 million in 2020 compared to 298 million in 2019 primarily driven by the decrease in costs related to the 2019 severance plan see note 2 for additional information 

amortization of acquisitionrelated intangibles 

amortization expenses decreased to 1926 million in 2020 compared to 1931 million in 2019 

operating results by business unit 

we evaluate the performance of business units based on segment profit which is defined as operating profit before restructuring and other charges net global expenses as discussed in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements and certain nonrecurring items net interest expense other income expense net and taxes on income see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for the reconciliation to income before taxes   



taste segment profit 

taste segment profit decreased 460 million to 4364 million 140 of segment sales in 2020 from 4824 million 151 of segment sales in the comparable 2019 period the decrease principally reflected volume reductions on existing business and unfavorable price versus input costs and mix partially offset by new win performances net of losses integration cross selling and productivity initiatives 

scent segment profit 

scent segment profit increased 78 million to 3573 million 181 of segment sales in 2020 compared to 3494 million 180 of segment sales reported in 2019 the increase in segment profit principally reflected the impact of new win performances net of losses and productivity initiatives partially offset by unfavorable price versus input costs and mix 

global expenses 

global expenses represent corporate and headquartersrelated expenses which include legal finance human resources and rd and other administrative expenses that are not allocated to an individual business unit in 2020 global expenses were 640 million compared to 388 million during 2019 the increase was principally driven by higher incentive compensation expense in 2020 and lower gains from our currency hedging program 

interest expense 

in 2020 interest expense decreased 64 million to 1318 million compared to 1382 million in 2019 this decrease was primarily driven by repayments on the 2018 term loan facility and teus average cost of debt was 30 for the 2020 and 2019 periods 

other income net 

other income net decreased approximately 237 million to 67 million of income in 2020 versus 304 million of income in 2019 the decrease was primarily driven by foreign exchange losses 

income taxes 

the effective tax rate was 168 in 2020 as compared to 174 in 2019 the yearoveryear decrease was largely due to a more favorable mix of earnings and lower repatriation costs partially offset by loss provisions and the cost of global intangible lowtaxed income gilti 

excluding the 328 million tax benefit associated with the pretax frutarom integration related costs restructuring and other charges net losses on sale of assets employee separation costs a pension settlement frutarom acquisition related costs compliance review  legal defense costs nb transaction related costs and nb integration related costs the adjusted effective tax rate for 2020 was 175 for 2019 the adjusted effective tax rate was 181 excluding the 262 million tax benefit associated with the pretax operational improvement initiatives frutarom integration related costs restructuring and other charges net losses on sale of assets fda mandated product recall frutarom acquisition related costs compliance review  legal defense costs and nb transaction related costs the yearoveryear decrease was largely due to a more favorable mix of earnings and lower repatriation costs partially offset by loss provisions and the cost of gilti 

2019 in comparison to 2018 

for a comparison of our results of operations for the fiscal years ended december 31 2019 and december 31 2018 see “part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of exhibit 991 to our form 8k for the fiscal year ended december 31 2019 filed with the sec on june 18 2020 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash and cash equivalents 

we had cash and cash equivalents of 6495 million at december 31 2020 compared to 6068 million at december 31 2019 and of this balance a portion was held outside the united states cash balances held in foreign jurisdictions are in most circumstances available to be repatriated to the united states 

effective utilization of the cash generated by our international operations is a critical component of our strategy we regularly repatriate cash from our nonus subsidiaries to fund financial obligations in the us as we repatriate these funds to the us we will be required to pay income taxes in certain us states and applicable foreign withholding taxes during the period when such repatriation occurs accordingly as of december 31 2020 we have a deferred tax liability of 471 million for the effect of repatriating the funds to the us 

restricted cash 

as discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements restricted cash relates to amounts escrowed for various items including for payments to be made to former frutarom option holders and for acquisition related payments at december 31 2020 we had a balance of 103 million of which 73 million is included in current assets and 30 million is included in other assets compared to 171 million at december 31 2019 

cash flows from operating activities 

operating cash flows in 2020 were 7141 million compared to 6990 million in 2019 and 4376 million in 2018 the increase in operating cash flows from 2019 to 2020 was principally driven by changes primarily related to accounts receivable inventories incentive compensation and accrued expenses largely offset by lower cash earnings in the current year the increase in operating cash flows from 2018 to 2019 was principally driven by higher earnings from inclusion of our frutarom acquisition and lower net working capital primarily related to accounts receivable 

working capital current assets less current liabilities totaled 12 billion at yearend 2020 compared to 14 billion at yearend 2019 

we have various factoring agreements in the us and the netherlands under which we can factor up to approximately 100 million in receivables with a financial institution additionally we maintain factoring programs that are sponsored by certain customers under all of the arrangements we sell the receivables on a nonrecourse basis to unrelated financial institutions and account for the transactions as a sale of receivables the applicable receivables are removed from our consolidated balance sheet when the cash proceeds are received 

as of december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 we had sold receivables pursuant to these factoring programs of approximately 2488 million 2057 million and 1683 million respectively participation in the various programs increased cash provided by operations by approximately 431 million 377 million and 136 million in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively the cost of participating in these programs was approximately 44 million 71 million and 34 million in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively see note 1 for additional information 

cash flows used in investing activities 

net investing activities in 2020 utilized 1875 million compared to 2259 million and 50 billion in 2019 and 2018 respectively the decrease in cash paid for investing activities from 2019 to 2020 was primarily driven by lower payments for acquisitions and lower spending on property plant and equipment partially offset by lower proceeds from disposal of assets in 2020 and cash paid on settlement of derivative instruments in 2020 versus proceeds in 2019 the decrease in cash paid for investing activities from 2018 to 2019 was primarily driven by higher payments for acquisitions in 2018 in 2019 we acquired 

certain companies as described in note 3 for approximately 491 million net of cash acquired in 2018 we acquired frutarom for approximately 70 billion net of cash acquired of which 49 billion was paid in cash 

additions to property plant and equipment were 1918 million 2360 million and 1701 million in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively net of grants and other reimbursements from government authorities these investments largely arise from our ongoing focus to align our manufacturing facilities with customer demand primarily in emerging markets and new technology consistent with our strategy 

in light of the covid19 pandemic we have evaluated and reprioritized our capital projects we expect that capital spending in 2021 will be approximately 45 of sales net of potential grants and other reimbursements from government authorities 

frutarom integration initiative 

we expect to achieve 145 million of synergy targets with total savings in line with our original expectations see note 2 for additional information related to the frutarom integration initiative 

cash flows used in financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities in 2020 was 5116 million compared to 5051 million in 2019 and cash provided by financing activities of 49 billion in 2018 respectively the slight increase in 2020 versus 2019 was principally driven by higher repayments of debt and higher dividend payments largely offset by cash proceeds from issuance of new longterm debt in the current year the decrease in 2019 versus 2018 was principally driven by frutarom related financing activities in 2018 partially offset by higher dividend payments in 2019 

at december 31 2020 and 2019 we had approximately 44 billion of debt outstanding 

we paid dividends totaling 3226 million 3135 million and 2302 million in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively the cash dividend declared per share in 2020 2019 and 2018 was 304 296 and 284 respectively 

our capital allocation strategy is primarily focused on debt repayment to maintain our investment grade rating we will also prioritize capital investment in our businesses to support the strategic long term plans we are also committed to maintaining our history of paying a dividend to investors determined by our board of directors at its discretion based on various factors 

we currently have a board approved stock repurchase program with a total remaining value of 2797 million as of may 7 2018 we have suspended our share repurchases 

capital resources 

operating cash flow provides the primary source of funds for capital investment needs dividends paid to shareholders and debt service repayments we anticipate that cash flows from operations and availability under our existing credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our investing and financing needs we regularly assess our capital structure including both current and longterm debt instruments as compared to our cash generation and investment needs in order to provide ample flexibility and to optimize our leverage ratios we believe our existing cash balances are sufficient to meet our debt service requirements

other contingencies 

see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for information related to other contingencies  

other commitments 

compliance with existing governmental requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment has not materially affected our operations earnings or competitive position in 2020 and 2019 we spent approximately 74 million and 45 million on capital projects and approximately 292 million and 260 million respectively in operating expenses and governmental charges for the purpose of complying with such regulations expenditures for these purposes will continue for the foreseeable future in addition we are party to a number of proceedings brought under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act or similar state statutes it is expected that the impact of any judgments in or voluntary settlements of such proceedings will not be material to our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

contractual obligations 

at december 31 2020 we had contractual payment obligations due within the time periods as specified in the following table   



 

1 the rate assumed for the variable interest component of the contractual interest obligation was the rate in effect at december 31 2020 see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our various borrowing facilities 

2 leases include facility and other lease commitments executed in the normal course of the business included in note 7 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

3 see note 16 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our retirement plans anticipated funding obligations are based on current actuarial assumptions the projected contributions beyond fiscal year 2023 are not currently determinable 

4 amounts represent expected future benefit payments for our postretirement benefit plans 

5 purchase commitments include agreements for raw material procurement and contractual capital expenditures amounts for purchase commitments represent only those items which are based on agreements that are enforceable and legally binding 

6 this amount represents the cash portion of the “toll charge” that is payable in installments over eight years beginning in 2018 this amount represents the five remaining installments 

the table above does not include 966 million of the total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions and approximately 174 million of associated accrued interest and 471 million associated with the deferred tax liability on deemed repatriation due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential cash flows we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the amount and period in which the remaining liabilities might be paid 

critical accounting policies and use of estimates 

our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements as disclosed in note 1 the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and accompanying disclosures these estimates are based on management’s best judgment of current events and actions that we may undertake in the future actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates 

those areas requiring the greatest degree of management judgment or deemed most critical to our financial reporting involve 

business combinations from time to time we enter into strategic acquisitions in an effort to better service existing customers and to attain new customers when we acquire a controlling financial interest in an entity or group of assets that are determined to meet the definition of a business we apply the acquisition method described in asc topic 805 business combinations in accordance with gaap the results of the acquisitions we have completed are reflected in our financial statements from the date of acquisition forward 

we allocate the purchase consideration paid to acquire the business to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values at the acquisition date with the excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill if during the measurement period a period not to exceed twelve months from the acquisition date we receive additional information that existed as of the acquisition date but at the time of the original allocation described above was unknown to us we make the appropriate adjustments to the purchase price allocation in the reporting period in which the amounts are determined 

significant judgment is required to estimate the intangibles and fair value of fixed assets and in assigning their respective useful lives accordingly we typically engage thirdparty valuation specialists who work under the direction of management to assist in valuing significant tangible and intangible assets acquired 

the fair value estimates are based on available historical information future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management but are inherently uncertain 

we typically use an income method to estimate the fair value of intangible assets which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants and include the amount and timing of future cash flows including expected growth rates discount rate and profitability royalty rates used in the relief of royalty method customer attrition rates product obsolescence factors a brand’s relative market position and the discount rate applied to the cash flows unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions 

determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires significant judgment all of our acquired intangible assets eg trademarks product formulas noncompete agreements and customer relationships are expected to have finite useful lives our estimates of the useful lives of finitelived intangible assets are based on a number of factors including competitive environment market share brand history operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the regions in which the brands are sold 

the costs of finitelived intangible assets are amortized through expense over their estimated lives the value of residual goodwill is not amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment as described in the following note for acquired intangible assets the remaining useful life of the trade names and trademarks product formulas and customer relationships was estimated at the point at which substantially all of the present value of cumulative cash flows have been earned 

the periodic assessment of potential impairment of goodwill we currently as of december 31 2020 have goodwill of 559 billion we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level as of november 30 every year or more frequently if 

events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a component to which goodwill is assigned when initially recorded 

we identify our reporting units by assessing whether the components of our operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and management of each operating segment regularly reviews the operating results of those components we have identified eight reporting units under the taste and scent segments 1 flavor compounds which includes the taste reporting unit that was previously included in the former frutarom segment as well as legacy iff flavor compounds 2 fragrance compounds 3 fragrance ingredients 4 cosmetic active ingredients 5 savory 6 natural product solutions 7 fine and specialty ingredients fsi and 8 inclusions 

for the annual impairment test as of november 30 2020 we utilized step 0 of the guidance in asc topic 350 intangibles – goodwill and other which allows for the assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value if based on a review of qualitative factors it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value a quantitative impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount based on a review of qualitative factors we determined that for four of the reporting units a quantitative step 1 impairment analysis was not necessary to determine if the carrying values of the reporting unit exceeded their fair values for the other four reporting units savory natural product solutions fsi and inclusions we determined that a step 1 test was necessary 

we assessed the fair value of the reporting units primarily using an income approach under the income approach we determined the fair value by using a discounted cash flow method at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the projected future cash flows of each reporting unit as well as a terminal value we use the most current actual and forecasted operating data available key estimates and assumptions used in these valuations include revenue growth rates and profit margins based on our internal forecasts and historical operating trends and our specific weightedaverage cost of capital used to discount future cash flows 

in performing the quantitative test we determined that the fair value of the four reporting units exceeded their carrying values and taken together with the results of the qualitative test we determined that there was no impairment of goodwill at any of our eight reporting units in 2020 based on the quantitative impairment test performed at november 30 2020 we determined that the excess of fair values over their respective carrying values ranged from 35 to 105 for two reporting units fsi and inclusions the remaining two reporting units savory and natural product solutions had less than 10 excess fair value over carrying value 

as of november 30 2020 the savory reporting unit had excess fair value over carrying value of approximately 5 and goodwill of 121 billion and the natural product solutions reporting unit had excess fair value over carrying value of approximately 1 and goodwill of 8514 million while management believes that the assumptions used in the impairment test were reasonable changes in key assumptions including lower revenue growth lower operating margin lower terminal growth rates or increasing discount rates could result in a future impairment 

if current longterm projections for these reporting units are not realized or materially decrease we may be required to writeoff all or a portion of the goodwill such charge could have a material effect on the consolidated statements of operations and balance sheets 

the periodic assessment of potential impairment of longlived assets we review longlived assets for impairment when events or changes in business conditions indicate that their full carrying value may not be recovered an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by an asset or group of assets is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists if assets are determined to be impaired the loss is measured based on an estimate of fair value using various valuation techniques including a discounted estimate of future cash flows

nongaap financial measures 

we use nongaap financial measures in this form 10k including i currency neutral metrics ii adjusted gross margin iii adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating margin iv adjusted selling and administrative expenses and v adjusted effective tax rate we also provide the nongaap measures adjusted ebitda and net debt solely for the purpose of providing information on the extent to which we are in compliance with debt covenants contained in its debt agreements our nongaap financial measures are defined below

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we operate on a global basis and are exposed to currency fluctuation related to the manufacture and sale of our products in currencies other than the us dollar the major foreign currencies involve the markets in the european union great britain mexico brazil china india indonesia australia russia and japan although all regions are subject to foreign currency fluctuations versus the us dollar we actively monitor our foreign currency exposures in all major markets in which we operate and employ a variety of techniques to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations including foreign currency hedging activities 

we have established a centralized reporting system to evaluate the effects of changes in interest rates currency exchange rates and other relevant market risks our risk management procedures include the monitoring of interest rate and foreign exchange exposures and hedge positions utilizing statistical analyses of cash flows market value and sensitivity analysis however the use of these techniques to quantify the market risk of such instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of their accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions for the year ended december 31 2020 our exposure to market risk was estimated using sensitivity analyses which illustrate the change in the fair value of a derivative financial instrument assuming hypothetical changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts with the objective of reducing exposure to cash flow volatility associated with foreign currency receivables and payables and with anticipated purchases of certain raw materials used in operations these contracts the counterparties to which are major international financial institutions generally involve the exchange of one currency for a second currency at a future date and have maturities not exceeding twelve months the gain or loss on the hedging instrument and services is recorded in earnings at the same time as the transaction being hedged is recorded in earnings at december 31 2020 our foreign currency exposures pertaining to derivative contracts exist with the euro japanese yen british pound australian dollar and indonesian rupiah based on a hypothetical decrease or increase of 10 in the applicable balance sheet exchange rates primarily against the us dollar the estimated fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts would increase by approximately 70 million however any change in the value of the contracts real or hypothetical would be significantly offset by a corresponding change in the value of the underlying hedged items 

we use derivative instruments as part of our interest rate risk management strategy we have entered into certain cross currency swap agreements in order to mitigate a portion of our net european investments from foreign currency risk as of december 31 2020 these swaps were in a net liability position with an aggregate fair value of 234 million based on a hypothetical decrease or increase of 10 in the value of the us dollar against the euro the estimated fair value of our cross currency swaps would change by approximately 347 million 

at december 31 2020 the fair value of our eur fixed rate debt was €21 billion based on a hypothetical decrease or increase of 10 in foreign exchange rates the estimated fair value of our eur fixed rate debt would change by approximately 2163 million 

at december 31 2020 the fair value of our usd fixed rate debt was 25 billion based on a hypothetical decrease or increase of 10 in interest rates the estimated fair value of our us fixed rate debt would change by approximately 2455 million 

we purchase certain commodities such as natural gas electricity petroleum based products and certain crop related items we generally purchase these commodities based upon market prices that are established with the vendor as part of the purchase process in general we do not use commodity financial instruments to hedge commodity prices

our product portfolio covers taste scent and complementary adjacent products and we have over 128000 individual products that are provided to customers in approximately 200 countries our global manufacturing footprint allows us to optimize our supply chain and support our global and regional customers as of december 31 2019 we had 104 manufacturing facilities and 82 creative centers and application laboratories located in 44 different countries we currently anticipate that we will continue to optimize our global facilities footprint as we seek opportunities to efficiently and costeffectively deliver value to our global and regional customers 

sales in 2019 were approximately 51 billion which management believes makes us the second largest company in the taste scent nutrition and specialty ingredient industry during the past few years we have diversified our customer base and leveraged our technical expertise to significantly expand our global small and midsized customer base through acquisitions including frutarom and the development of tastepoint based on 2019 sales of our approximately 38000 customers approximately 35 are global consumer products companies and approximately 65 are small and midsized companies during 2019 our 25 largest customers accounted for 38 of our sales in 2019 no customer accounted for more than 10 of sales 

our business is geographically diverse with sales in the us representing approximately 20 of sales in 2019 no other country represents more than 6 of sales we believe that more significant future growth potential for taste and scent and for our business exists in the emerging markets which we classify as all markets except north america japan australia and western southern and northern europe as a result we intend to continue to build on our multidecade experience in the emerging markets as our customers seek to grow their businesses in emerging markets we provide them the ability to leverage our longstanding international presence and extensive market knowledge to help drive their brands in these markets 

for the periods presented in this form 10k our business was organized in three segments taste scent and frutarom beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 we are operating our business across two segments taste and scent as part of this new operating model nearly all of the former frutarom business segment was combined with the taste segment the financial results presented in this form 10k reflect the taste scent and legacy frutarom business segments prior to the realignment 

vision 2021 and frutarom integration initiative

flavor ingredients the flavor ingredients market includes natural flavor extracts specialty botanical extracts distillates essential oils citrus products aroma chemicals and natural gums and resins such ingredients are used for food beverage and flavors and are often sold directly to food and beverage manufacturers who use them in producing consumer products 

scent 

our global scent business creates fragrance compounds and fragrance ingredients that are integral elements in the world’s finest perfumes and bestknown household and personal care products we believe our unique portfolio of natural and synthetic ingredients global footprint innovative technologies and knowhow deep consumer insight and customer intimacy make us a market leader in scent 

our scent business is a vertically integrated operation originating in our research facilities with the development of natural synthetic and proprietary molecules and innovative delivery systems progressing to our creative centers application laboratories and consumer insight teams where our perfumers partner with our customers to create unique fragrance compounds for use in a variety of enduse products finally we produce these products in our manufacturing facilities in a consistent highquality and costeffective manner we also produce cosmetic active and functional ingredients for use in cosmetics by providing our fragrance development teams with an extensive portfolio of innovative highquality and effective ingredients to support their creativity we are able to provide our customers with a unique identity for their brands these ingredients or fragrance compounds can then be combined with our innovative delivery systems which are key differentiators in the growth of our consumer fragrance portfolio in september 2019 we opened our new home  fabric care innovation center in holmdel new jersey a 60000 squarefoot research and development hub to further drive innovation in our home care and fabric care categories including digital olfaction technology immersive virtual reality scent experiences and the latest generation of encapsulation technology 

fragrance compounds  fragrance compounds are unique and proprietary combinations of multiple ingredients that are ultimately used by our customers in their consumer goods our creative and commercial teams within fragrance compounds are organized into two broad categories fine fragrances and consumer fragrances 

our fine fragrances focus on perfumes and colognes our scientists and perfumers collaborate to develop new molecules new natural extractions and innovative processes to create unique inspiring fragrances we have created some of the industryleading fine fragrance classics as well as cuttingedge niche fragrances as evidenced by the number of top sellers and award winners 

our consumer fragrances include five enduse categories of products

• toiletries including deodorants and shaving creams 

ingredients  fragrance ingredients consists of natural and synthetic of active and functional ingredients that are used internally and sold to third parties including competitors for use in preparation of compounds while the principal role of our fragrance ingredients facilities is to support our fragrance compounds business we utilize our excess manufacturing capacity to manufacture and sell certain fragrance ingredients to third parties we believe that this business allows us to leverage our fixed costs while maintaining the security of supply for our perfumers and ultimately our customers fragrance ingredients available for sale to third parties include innovative ingredients that leverage our manufacturing experience as well as a limited amount of costcompetitive commodity ingredients fragrance ingredients also includes our cosmetic active and functional ingredients which provide biologists and cosmetic chemists with innovative solutions to address cosmetic challenges such as skin aging and hair protection with approximately 1800 separate fragrance and active and functional ingredients plus additional botanicals and delivery systems we believe we are a leader in the industry with the breadth of our product portfolio 

legacy frutarom 

during 2019 our frutarom business created and manufactured a broad suite of flavor compounds and specialty fine ingredients largely targeting small local and regional customers as noted above beginning in fiscal year 2020 our business segments have been realigned such that nearly all of the frutarom business segment will combine with our taste business the financial results presented in this form 10k reflect the scent taste and frutarom business segments prior to the realignment 

consumer insights research and product development process 

the markets in which we compete require constant innovation to stay ahead of the curve and to be competitive consumer preferences tend to drive change in our markets and as science evolves and sustainability continues to be a key factor to customers and consumers we must continue to strengthen our research and development platforms and adapt our capabilities to provide differentiated products to our customers 

consumer insights 

we believe that the first step to creating an innovative and unique flavor or fragrance experience begins with gaining insight into the consumer and emerging trends by developing a deep understanding of what consumers value and prefer through our consumer insight programs we are better able to focus our research and development and creative efforts 

our consumer science insight and marketing teams interpret trends monitor product launches analyze quantitative market data and conduct numerous consumer interviews annually our sensory experts direct research programs exploring topics such as fragrance performance the psychophysics of sensory perception including chemesthetic properties such as warming cooling and tingling the genetic basis for flavor and fragrance preference and the effects of aromas on mood performance health and wellbeing 

based on this information we develop innovative and proprietary programs to evaluate potential products that enable us to understand the emotional connections between a prospective product and the consumer we believe this ability to pinpoint the likelihood of a product’s success translates into stronger brand equity resulting in increased returns and greater market share gains for our customers as well as for iff 

research and development 

we consider our research and development infrastructure to be one of our key competencies and critical to our ability to provide differentiated products to our customers we focus and invest substantial resources in the research and development of new and innovative molecules compounds formulas and technologies and the application of these to our customers’ products using the knowledge gained from our consumer insights programs we strategically focus our resources around key research and development platforms that address or anticipate consumer needs or preferences by aligning our capabilities and resources to these platforms we ensure the proper support and focus for each program so that it can be further developed and eventually accepted for commercial application 

we have been granted 415 patents in the united states since 2000 and we have developed many unique molecules and delivery systems for our customers that are used as the foundations of successful flavors and fragrances around the world 

we have traditionally conducted our principal basic research and development activities in union beach new jersey where we employ scientists and application engineers who collaborate with our other research and development centers around the world to support the 

• discovery of new materials 

• development of new technologies such as delivery systems 

• creation of new compounds and 

• enhancement of existing ingredients and compounds 

we also have key basic research and development centers in tilburg the netherlands neuilly and grasse france and nanjing china as of december 31 2019  we employed approximately 2300 people globally in research and development activities 

our ingredients research program discovers molecules found in natural substances and creates new molecules that are subsequently tested for their sensorial value to broaden our offerings of natural innovative and unique products we seek collaborations with research institutions and other companies throughout the world we have established a number of such collaborations to strengthen our innovation pipeline we may also consider acquiring companies that could provide access to new technologies 

the development of new and customized flavor and fragrance compounds is a complex process calling upon the combined knowledge of our scientists flavorists and perfumers scientists from various disciplines work in project teams with flavorists and perfumers to develop flavor and fragrance compounds with consumer preferred performance characteristics the development of new flavor and fragrance compounds requires i an indepth knowledge of the flavor and fragrance 

characteristics of the various ingredients we use ii an understanding of how the many ingredients in a consumer product interact and iii the creation of controlled release and delivery systems to enhance flavor and fragrance performance to facilitate this process we have a scientific advisory board that provides external perspectives and independent feedback on our research and development and sustainability initiatives 

creative application 

through our global network of creative centers and application laboratories we create or adapt the basic flavors or fragrances compounds that we have developed in the research and development process to commercialize for use in our customers’ consumer products our global creative teams consist of perfumers fragrance evaluators and flavorists as well as marketing consumer science consumer insights and technical application experts from a wide range of cultures and nationalities in close partnership with our customers’ product development groups our creative teams create the sensory experiences that our customers are seeking in order to satisfy consumer demands in each of their markets 

new flavor and fragrance development is driven by a variety of sources including requests from our customers who are in need of specific flavors and fragrances for use in a new or modified consumer product or as a result of internal initiatives stemming from our consumer insights program our product development team works in partnership with our scientists and researchers to optimize the consumer appeal and relevance of our flavors and fragrances a collaborative process between our researchers our product development team and our customers then follows to perfect the flavors and fragrances so they are ready to be included in the final consumer product 

in addition to creating new flavors and fragrances our researchers and product development teams advise customers on ways to improve their existing products by moderating or substituting current ingredients with more readily accessible or less expensive materials enhancing their yield this often results in creating a better value proposition for our customers 

our flavors and fragrances compound formulas are treated as trade secrets and remain our proprietary assets our business is not materially dependent upon any individual patent trademark or license 

supply chain 

we strive to provide our customers with consistent quality products on a timely and costeffective basis by managing all aspects of the supply chain from raw material sourcing through manufacturing quality assurance regulatory compliance and distribution 

procurement 

in connection with the manufacture of compounds we use natural ingredients and primarily in our fragrance compounds synthetic ingredients we purchase approximately 23000 different raw materials from an extensive network of domestic and international suppliers and distributors 

with the acquisition of frutarom we significantly increased our natural products and therefore the percentage of our ingredients that are natural or croprelated has increased natural ingredients are derived from flowers fruits and other botanical products as well as from animal products and contain varying numbers of organic chemicals that are responsible for the fragrance or flavor of the natural product natural products are purchased in processed or semiprocessed form some are used in compounds in the state in which they are obtained and others are used after further processing natural products together with various chemicals are also used as raw materials for the manufacture of synthetic ingredients by chemical processes our flavor products also include extracts and seasonings derived from various fruits vegetables nuts herbs spices and microbiologicallyderived ingredients 

in order to ensure our supply of raw materials achieve favorable pricing and provide timely transparency regarding inflationary trends to our customers we continue to be focused on 

• purchasing under contract with fixed or formula based pricing for set time periods 

• entering into supplier relationships to gain access to supplies and available capacity that we do not have 

• implementing indexed pricing 

• reducing the complexity of our formulations and 

• evaluating whether it is more profitable to buy or make an ingredient 

• local country sourcing with our own procurement professionals 

manufacturing and distribution 

as of december 31 2019 we had 186 manufacturing facilities and creative centers and application laboratories located in 44 different countries our major manufacturing facilities are located in the united states the netherlands spain great britain germany indonesia turkey brazil mexico slovenia china india and singapore based on the regional nature of the taste business and the concerns regarding the fragile nature of transporting raw materials we have typically established smaller manufacturing facilities in our local markets that are focused on local needs products within the scent business are typically composed of compounds that are more stable and more transportable around the world consequently we have fewer manufacturing facilities within our scent business which produce compounds and ingredients for global distribution 

in connection with the integration of frutarom we have undertaken to optimize our global operations footprint to efficiently and costeffectively deliver value to our global customers as part of this effort we expect to close approximately 35 manufacturing sites over the next two years with most of the closures targeted to occur before the end of fiscal 2020  during 2019  the company announced the closure of 10 facilities of which six facilities are in europe africa and middle east one facility in each north america greater asia and latin america regions 

our supply chain initiatives are focused on increasing capacity and investments in key technologies within our more mature markets we tend to focus on consolidation and cost optimization as well as implementing new technologies in addition to our own manufacturing facilities we develop relationships with third parties including contract manufacturing organizations that permit us to expand access to the technologies capabilities and capacity that we need to better serve our customers 

sustainability 

over the past several years we have redefined the way we envision sustainability moving from the traditional “takemakedispose” model we have embraced the circular economy model  one that is restorative and regenerative by design which we believe is key in safeguarding the wellbeing of our consumers the health of our planet and the integrity of our business 

customers and consumers want to know if the products they are purchasing are responsibly sourced and environmentally conscious our sustainability vision and strategy are designed to meet these global trends and we are committed to making real progress happen at every opportunity following the frutarom acquisition we are working on assessing our combined environmental footprint with the intent of identifying synergies gaps and opportunities in our sustainability efforts and upgrading the legacy frutarom operations to better align them with the legacy iff sustainability practices 

in line with our vision 2021 strategy and our goal of redefining how we live in and care for the resources of our world our sustainability goals include 

• reducing our environmental footprint  we will seek to leverage synergies and manage our combined footprint to reduce our environmental impact 

• strengthening responsible sourcing  we will continue to assess our supply chain and seek to increase sustainable sourcing across our combined supply base 

• driving sustainable innovation  we will seek to embed sustainability into our products and processes 

• embracing people and communities  we will seek to create a culture of diversity and inclusiveness while giving back to the communities where we source and operate 

in 2019 we were recognized for our sustainability efforts with the 2019 “industry mover” award from sam a subsidiary of robecosam which specializes in providing environmental social and governance esg data benchmarks and ratings the award acknowledges iff’s topscoring performance in economic social and environmental categories we also reconfirmed our commitment to mitigate climate change by signing the united nation’s business ambition for 15°c our only future pledge committing to set sciencebased emissions targets to limit global temperature rise to 15 degrees celsius in addition among other distinctions we were named to barron’s 100 most sustainable companies list for the second consecutive year recognizing our exceptional environmental social and corporate governance performance 

for more detailed information about our sustainability programs and performance please refer to our annual sustainability report 

governmental regulation 

we develop produce and market our products in a number of jurisdictions around the world and are subject to federal regional and local legislation and regulations in each of the various countries our products which among other industries are intended for use in food beverage and pharmaceutical industries are subject to strict quality and regulatory standards as a result we in turn are required to meet these strict standards which in recent years have become increasingly stringent and affect both existing as well as new products 

our products and operations are subject to regulation by governmental agencies in each of the markets in which we operate these agencies include 1 the food and drug administration and equivalent international agencies that regulate flavors and other ingredients in consumer products 2 the environmental protection agency and equivalent international agencies that regulate our manufacturing facilities 3 the occupational safety and health administration and equivalent international agencies that regulate the working conditions in our manufacturing research laboratories and creative centers 4 local and international agencies that regulate trade and customs 5 the drug enforcement administration and other local or international agencies that regulate controlled chemicals that we use in our operations and 6 the chemical registrationnotification authorities that regulate chemicals that we use in or transport to the various countries in which we manufacture andor market our products we have seen an increase in registration and reporting requirements concerning the use of certain chemicals in a number of countries such as registration evaluation authorisation and restriction of chemicals “reach” regulations in the european union as well as similar regulations in other countries in addition the acquisition of frutarom introduced business adjacencies which broaden the landscape of regulatory compliance requirements applicable to iff 

in addition we are subject to various rules relating to health work safety and the environment at the local and international levels in the various countries in which we operate our manufacturing facilities throughout the world are subject to environmental standards relating to air emissions sewage discharges the use of hazardous materials waste disposal practices and cleanup of existing environmental contamination in recent years there has been a significant increase in the stringency of environmental regulation and enforcement of environmental standards and the costs of compliance have risen significantly a trend we expect will continue in the future 

competition 

the markets for taste and scent are part of a larger market that supplies a wide variety of ingredients and compounds used in consumer products the broader market includes functional foods and food additives including seasonings texturizers spices enzymes certain foodrelated commodities and fortified products as well as nutritional ingredients supplements and active cosmetic ingredients 

the global market for taste and scent has expanded consistently primarily as a result of an increase in demand for and an increase in the variety of consumer products containing flavors and fragrances 

the market for taste and scent is highly competitive based on annual sales our main competitors consist of 1 the three other large global flavor and fragrance manufacturers givaudan firmenich and symrise 2 midsized companies 3 numerous regional and local manufacturers and 4 consumer product companies who may develop their own flavors or fragrances 

we believe that our ability to compete successfully in the flavors and fragrances submarket is based on 

• our indepth understanding of consumers 

• vertical integration 

• innovation and technological advances from our research and development activities and our perfumers and flavorists 

• our ability to tailor products to customers’ needs 

• our ability to manufacture products on a global scale and 

• broadbased regulatory capabilities 

large multinational customers and increasingly midsized customers may limit the number of their suppliers by placing some on “core lists” giving them priority for development and production of their new or modified products to compete more successfully in this environment we must make continued investments in customer relationships and tailor our research and development efforts to anticipate customers’ needs provide effective service and secure and maintain inclusion on these “core lists” 

private label manufacturers mostly mediumsized local or small food manufacturers constitute a growing segment in the flavor market over the last decade with the strengthening of supermarket chains online platforms and growing consumer price consciousness demand and consumption of private label products has grown at a faster rate than the brand food industry rate we believe that new business opportunities will continue to arise from these clients as they are increasing their demand for products that are similar to existing products in the market distinctive premium products as well as more innovative products 

the global demand for functional foods food additives natural ingredients nutritional ingredients and supplements and active cosmetic ingredients is also growing with our recent acquisitions we have expanded our offerings to include products within the functional food ingredient market including ingredients focused on improving the health and wellness characteristics of a consumer good the nutritional supplement and infant nutrition markets and the cosmetic actives market while the three other large global flavor and fragrance manufacturers givaudan firmenich and symrise are active in these areas we also compete with specialty chemical companies other large multinational companies and smaller regional and local participants that offer products that address these same needs 

our people 

the success of our business is built on our talented employees our global team uses the latest science insights research creative thinking and customer understanding to develop products that make an impact with customers and consumers across the world at december 31 2019  we had approximately 13600 employees worldwide of whom approximately 2000 are employed in the united states we believe that relations with our employees are good

risk factors 

tableend

we routinely encounter and address risks in conducting our business some of these risks may cause our future results to be different  sometimes materially different  than we presently anticipate below are material risks we have identified that could adversely affect our business how we react to material future developments as well as how our competitors and customers react to those developments could also affect our future results 

risks related to our business and industry 

we may not realize all the benefits anticipated from the frutarom acquisition which could adversely affect our business 

the success of the frutarom acquisition ultimately depends on our ability to realize anticipated benefits from the transaction since the frutarom acquisition we have benefited from and expect to continue to benefit from cost synergies through global footprint optimization across manufacturing the realization of significant procurement synergies plus organizational and operational efficiencies in overhead expenses we also expect to achieve revenue synergies by leveraging customer relationships across a much broader customer base and crossselling legacy iff and frutarom technology and capabilities if we fail to realize all the benefits that we expect to achieve from the frutarom acquisition our business could be adversely affected 

the integration of our legacy iff business and frutarom’s business is a costly and timeconsuming process and we may face significant implementation challenges that will impact our ability to realize the expected benefits from the acquisition including without limitation 

• potential disruption of or reduced growth in our historical core businesses due to diversion of management attention as well as financial and other resources from our historical core business and uncertainty with our current customer and supplier relationships 

• loss of business as a result of changes in customer andor competitor behaviors following the frutarom acquisition including our inability to keep certain customer accounts of frutarom who may be direct competitors to iff or our need to deprioritize our business activities in certain markets based on market conditions 

• difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings synergies business opportunities and growth prospects 

• challenges arising from the expansion of our product offerings into adjacencies with which we have limited experience including functional foods and nutrition 

• the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding the integration 

• coordinating and integrating research and development teams across technologies and products to enhance product development while reducing costs 

• coordinating sales and marketing efforts to effectively position our capabilities and the direction of product development 

• ensuring regulatory compliance quality safety and sustainability standards across an organization of increased scale and complexity 

• retaining and efficiently managing our significantly expanded and decentralized customer base 

• the assumption of and exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of frutarom 

• unanticipated issues or higher than expected costs in consolidating and integrating corporate information technology finance and administrative infrastructures and integrating and harmonizing business systems 

• combining and optimizing our manufacturing facilities and global supply chain as well as leveraging customer relationships for crossselling opportunities 

• aligning compliance quality as well as safety and sustainability standards across operations 

• aligning processes policies procedures technologies operations employee benefits information technologies and systems across operations 

• difficulties in managing a larger and more complex combined company addressing differences in business culture and retaining key personnel and 

• managing tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating the operations of the combined company 

some of these factors are outside of our control and any one of them if not successfully managed could result in increased costs and diversion of management’s time and energy as well as reputational harm and decreases in the amount of expected revenue which could materially impact our business financial condition and results of operations if the anticipated benefits from the frutarom acquisition are not fully realized or take longer to realize than expected the value of our common stock revenues levels of expenses and results of operations may be adversely affected 

the frutarom acquisition resulted and may continue to result in significant costs charges or other liabilities that could adversely affect the financial results of the combined company 

following the acquisition of frutarom our financial results were adversely affected by restructuring charges cash expenses and noncash accounting charges incurred in connection with the acquisition we expect to record total pretax restructuring charges related to the frutarom acquisition of approximately 65 million  of which 104 million have been recorded since closing of the transaction through december 31 2019 comprised of approximately 61 million of severance and related benefit costs 05 million of asset writedowns and writeoffs and 37 million of costs associated with exit and disposal activities in addition there are many processes policies procedures operations technologies and systems that are being integrated across our organization that will result in costs including financial advisory tax information technology legal consulting and other professional advisory fees associated with these integration activities costs and expenses incurred in connection with the integration limit resources that may otherwise be available for investment in research and development and capital expenditures 

as a result of the acquisition we assumed all of frutarom’s liabilities including unknown and contingent liabilities due to the nature of the transaction and the characteristics of frutarom our ability to conduct extensive due diligence was limited and we may subsequently identify unknown liabilities including those that frutarom assumed in its prior acquisitions that are not currently probable or estimable prior to our acquisition frutarom completed 47 acquisitions since 2011 including 22 since the beginning of 2016 if we do not properly assess the scope of these liabilities or if these liabilities are neither probable nor estimable at this time our future financial results could be adversely affected by unanticipated reserves or charges unexpected litigation or regulatory exposure unfavorable accounting charges unexpected increases in taxes due a loss of anticipated tax benefits or other adverse effects on our business operating results or financial condition 

we may fail to realize the expected cost savings and increased efficiencies from or stay within our estimated costs of the frutarom integration and our ongoing optimization of our manufacturing facilities may not be as effective as we anticipate 

our ability to realize anticipated cost savings and synergies from the frutarom manufacturing rationalization may be affected by a variety of factors which may impose significant risks to us and which may be out of our control including 

• our ability to accurately estimate costs in multiple jurisdictions related to the consolidation updating or closing of manufacturing facilities 

• our ability to successfully and efficiently manufacture the relocated product lines at a different manufacturing facility 

• our ability to effectively reduce overhead and integrate and retain employees of the relocated operations 

• difficulties in implementing and maintaining consistent standards controls procedures policies and information systems 

• integrating newly acquired manufacturing distribution and technology facilities 

• potential strains on our personnel systems and resources and diversion of attention from other priorities and 

• unforeseen or contingent liabilities of the relocated operations including tax liabilities 

actual charges costs and adjustments arising from these activities may vary materially from our estimates and may require cash and noncash integration and implementation costs or charges in excess of forecasted amounts which could offset any such savings and other synergies and therefore could have an adverse effect on our margins 

furthermore as part of our ongoing strategy we seek to enhance our manufacturing efficiency and align our geographic manufacturing footprint with our expectations of future growth and technology needs for example we are in the process of relocating one of our fragrance ingredients facilities in china and constructing new facilities in india and indonesia in addition in connection with the frutarom integration we are consolidating updating andor closing manufacturing facilities to achieve synergies and align our manufacturing footprint 

our incurrence of additional debt to pay the cash portion of the frutarom consideration increased our financial leverage and could adversely affect our future cash flows and cost of capital 

in connection with the acquisition of frutarom we borrowed approximately 33 billion of additional debt thereby significantly increasing our leverage as of december 31 2019 our total debt consisted of 44 billion there may be circumstances in which required payments of principal andor interest on our debt could adversely affect our cash flows our operating results or our ability to return capital to our shareholders furthermore our degree of leverage could adversely affect our future credit ratings if we are unable to maintain or improve our current investment grade rating it could adversely affect our future cost of funding liquidity and access to capital markets in addition our current level of leverage could increase our vulnerability to sustained adverse macroeconomic weakness limit our ability to obtain further financing and our ability to pursue certain operational and strategic opportunities including large acquisitions our level of indebtedness as well as our failure to comply with covenants under our debt instruments could adversely affect our business results of operation and financial condition 

failure to successfully establish and manage acquisitions collaborations joint ventures or partnerships could adversely affect our growth 

from time to time we evaluate acquisition candidates that may strategically fit our business andor growth objectives if we are unable to successfully integrate and develop acquired businesses we could fail to achieve anticipated synergies and cost savings including any expected increase in revenues and operating results which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results we may also incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions that reduce our earnings 

additionally we also evaluate and enter into collaborations joint ventures or partnerships from time to time to enhance our research and development efforts or expand our product portfolios and technology the process of establishing and maintaining collaborative relationships is difficult and timeconsuming to negotiate document and implement we may not be able to successfully negotiate such arrangements or the terms of the arrangements may not be as favorable as anticipated furthermore our ability to generate revenues from such collaborations will depend on our partners’ abilities and efforts to successfully perform the functions assigned to them in these arrangements and these collaborations may not lead to development or commercialization of products in the most efficient manner or at all in addition from time to time we have acquired and we may acquire only a majority interest in companies and provided or may provide earnouts for the former owners along with the ability at our option or obligation at the former owners’ option to purchase the minority interests at a future date at an established price these investments may have additional risks and may not be as efficient as other operations as we may have fiduciary or contractual obligations to the minority investors and may rely on former owners for the continuing operation of the acquired business if we are unable to successfully establish and manage these collaborative relationships and majority investments it could adversely affect our future growth 

our business is highly competitive and if we are unable to compete effectively our sales and results of operations will suffer 

the markets in which we compete are highly competitive we face vigorous competition from companies throughout the world including multinational and specialized flavors fragrances nutrition and specialty ingredients companies as well as consumer product companies which may develop their own flavors fragrances or ingredients in the flavors industry we also face increasing competition from ingredient suppliers that have expanded their portfolios to include flavor offerings some of our competitors specialize in one or more of our product subsegments while others participate in many of our product subsegments in addition some of our global competitors may have more resources than we do or may have proprietary products that could permit them to respond to changing business and economic conditions more effectively than we can consolidation of our competitors may exacerbate these risks 

as we continue to enter into adjacent markets such as cosmetic ingredients functional foods specialty fine ingredients and nutrition products we may face greater competitionrelated risks in these markets than with our core historic flavor and fragrances businesses for example the specialty fine ingredients market is more price sensitive than the flavors market and is characterized by relatively lower profit margins some fine ingredients products are less unique and more replaceable than competitors’ products there is no assurance that operating margins will remain at current levels which could substantially impact our business operating results and financial condition 

competition in our business is based among other things on innovation product quality regulatory compliance pricing quality of customer service the support provided by marketing and application groups and understanding of consumers it is difficult for us to predict the timing scale and success of our competitors’ actions in these areas in particular the discovery and development of new flavors and fragrance compounds and ingredients protection of our intellectual property and development and retention of key employees are critical to our ability to effectively compete in our business advancement in technologies have also enhanced the ability of our competitors to develop substitutable products increased competition by existing or future competitors including aggressive price competition could result in the loss of sales reduced pricing and margin pressure and could adversely impact our sales and profitability 

if we are unable to successfully market to our expanded and diverse taste customer base our operating results and future growth may be adversely affected 

as a result of our acquisition of frutarom the number of our customers significantly increased and became more diverse our historical customer base was primarily comprised of large and mediumsized food beverage and consumer products companies as a result of the expansion of our tastepoint initiative and the frutarom acquisition and based on 2019 sales we currently have approximately 38000 customers approximately 65 of which are small and midsized companies this substantial increase in and diversity of our customer base requires us to adjust among other things our product development manufacturing distribution marketing customer relationship and sales strategy as well as adapt corporate information technology finance and administrative infrastructures to support different gotomarket models we may experience difficulty managing the growth of a portfolio of customers that is more diverse in terms of its geographical presence as well as with respect to the types of services they require and the infrastructure required to deliver our products if we are unable to successfully gain market share or maintain our relationships with these customers our future growth could be adversely affected 

our success depends on attracting and retaining talented people within our business significant shortfalls in recruitment or retention could adversely affect our ability to compete and achieve our strategic goals 

attracting developing and retaining talented employees including our perfumers scientists and flavorists is essential to the successful delivery of our products and success in the marketplace furthermore as we continue to focus on innovation our need for scientists and other professionals will increase an important factor in our ability to realize our anticipated benefits from the frutarom acquisition is our ability to retain key employees at frutarom the ability to attract and retain talented employees is critical in the development of new products and technologies which is an integral component of our growth strategy 

competition for employees can be intense and if we are unable to successfully integrate motivate and reward the acquired frutarom employees or our current employees in our combined company we may not be able to retain them if we are unable to retain these employees or attract new employees in the future our ability to effectively compete with our competitors and to grow our business could be adversely affected 

a significant portion of our sales is generated from a limited number of large multinational customers which are currently under competitive pressures that may affect the demand for our products and profitability 

during 2019 our 25 largest customers each of which was a multinational consumer products company accounted for 38 of our sales large multinational customers’ market share especially in the consumer product industry continues to be pressured by new smaller companies and specialty players that cater to or are more adept at adjusting to the latest consumer trends including towards natural products and clean labels changes in the retail landscape including ecommerce and consolidation and increased competition from private labels which have resulted and may continue to result in decreased demand for our products by such multinational customers and volume erosion especially in our taste business furthermore consolidations amongst our customers have resulted in larger and more sophisticated customers with greater buying power and additional negotiating strength if such trends continue our sales could be adversely impacted if we are not able to replace these sales 

in addition large multinational customers and increasingly middle market customers continue to utilize “core lists” of suppliers to improve margins and profitability typically these “core list suppliers are then given priority for new or modified products recently these customers are making inclusion on their “core lists” contingent upon a supplier providing more favorable commercial terms including rebates which could adversely affect our margins we must either offer competitive costinuse solutions to secure and maintain inclusion on these “core lists” or seek to manage the relationship without being on the “corelist” if we choose not to pursue “corelist” status due to profitability concerns or if we are unable to obtain “corelist” status our ability to maintain our share of these customers’ future purchases could be adversely affected and therefore our future results of operations 

we may not successfully develop and introduce new products that meet our customers’ needs which may adversely affect our results of operations 

our ability to differentiate ourselves and deliver growth in line with our vision 2021 strategy largely depends on our ability to successfully develop and introduce new products and product improvements that meet our customers’ needs and ultimately appeal to consumers innovation is a key element of our ability to develop and introduce new products we cannot be certain that we will be successful in achieving our innovation goals such as the development of new molecules new and expanded delivery systems and other technologies we currently spend approximately 67 of our sales on research and development however this investment level may vary if available resources to invest in research and development are limited due to our ongoing integration and restructuring efforts our research and development investments may only generate future revenues to the extent that we are able to develop products that meet our customers’ specifications are at an acceptable cost and achieve acceptance by the targeted consumer market furthermore there may be significant lag times from the time we incur research and development costs to the time that these research and development costs may result in increased revenue consequently even when we “win” a project our ability to generate revenues as a result of these investments is subject to numerous customer economic and other risks that are outside of our control including delays by our customers in the launch of a new product the level of promotional support for the launch poor performance of our thirdparty vendors anticipated sales by our customers not being realized or changes in market preferences or demands or disruptive innovations by competitors 

natural disasters public health crises such as the recent coronavirus outbreak international conflicts terrorist acts labor strikes political crisis accidents and other events could adversely affect our business and financial results by disrupting development manufacturing distribution or sale of our products 

as a company engaged in the global development manufacture and distribution of products we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities including industrial accidents environmental events strikes and other labor disputes product quality control issues safety licensing requirements and other regulatory issues as well as natural disasters public health crises such as pandemics or epidemics international conflicts terrorist acts and other external factors over which we have no control 

while we operate research and development manufacturing and distribution facilities throughout the world many of these facilities are extremely specialized and certain of our research and development or creative laboratories facilities are uniquely situated to support our research and development efforts while certain of our manufacturing facilities are the sole location where a specific ingredient or product is produced if our research and development activities or the manufacturing of ingredients or products were disrupted the cost of relocating or replacing these activities or reformulating these ingredients or products may be substantial which could result in production or development delays or otherwise have an adverse effect on our margins operating results and future growth 

for example in december 2019 there was an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus covid19 in wuhan china that has since spread to other regions in china and the rest of the world to contain the outbreak the chinese central government extended the lunar new year holiday for one week and issued guidance pursuant to which local governments in china have taken temporary measures to limit large gatherings and impose travel restrictions as a result a portion of our manufacturing plants and offices in china were required to close for a week the outbreak may result in additional or more extensive travel restrictions closures disruptions of businesses or facilities in china or other affected regions around the world or lead to social economic political or labor instability in the affected areas may impact our our suppliers’ or our customers’ operations the outbreak may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations at this point the extent of such impact is uncertain 

a disruption in our supply chain including the inability to obtain ingredients and raw materials from third parties could adversely affect our business and financial results 

in connection with our manufacture of our fragrance and flavor products we often rely on third party suppliers for ingredients and raw materials that are integral to our manufacture of such compounds our purchases of raw materials are subject to fluctuations in market price and availability caused by weather conditions climate change as further discussed below market conditions governmental actions and other factors beyond our control affecting us andor our suppliers import alerts or specific country regulations may impair or delay our ability to obtain sufficient quantity of certain ingredients raw materials and naturals at the relevant manufacturing facility in addition our ingredient or raw material suppliers similar to us are subject to risks as applicable inherent in agriculture manufacturing and distribution on a global scale including industrial accidents environmental events strikes and other labor disputes disruptions in supply chain or information systems disruption or loss of key research or manufacturing sites product quality control safety and environmental compliance issues licensing requirements and other regulatory issues as well as natural disasters global or local health crisis international conflicts terrorist acts and other external factors over which they have no control these suppliers also could become insolvent or experience other financial distress for example in 2017 a fire at the manufacturing facility of basf group “basf” one of 

our suppliers caused them to declare a force majeure and has resulted in industry disruption due to the lack of availability of certain ingredients used in many fragrance compounds 

these risks are enhanced since we often rely on a limited number of suppliers for particular ingredients if our suppliers are unable to supply us with sufficient quantities of ingredients and raw materials to meet our needs we would need to seek alternative sources of such materials or pursue our own production of such ingredients or direct acquisition of such raw materials however for certain of our ingredients and raw materials we rely on a limited number of suppliers where there are not readily available alternatives if we are unable to obtain or manufacture alternative sources of such ingredients or raw materials at a similar cost we would seek to i reformulate our compounds andor ii increase pricing to reflect the higher supply cost however if we are not able to successfully implement any of these alternatives we could experience disruptions in production increased cost of sales and a corresponding decrease in gross margin or reduced sales especially if our competitors were able to more successfully adjust to such market disruption at the same time industrywide supply disruptions such as the one caused by the basf incident may lead to broader market shortages and sales volatility such fluctuations and decrease in gross margin could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

volatility and increases in the price of raw materials energy and transportation including due to climate change could harm our profits 

we use many different raw materials for our business particularly natural products including essential oils extracts and concentrates derived from fruits vegetables flowers woods and other botanicals animal products raw fruits organic chemicals and petroleumbased chemicals we have experienced price volatility with respect to raw materials for example there has been industrywide price volatility of certain ingredients used in fragrance compounds due to the basf incident and in 2019 we experienced increases in the prices of certain naturals 

natural products represent approximately half of our raw material spend and we expect such volatility to continue in the near future in addition because we offer a substantial number of natural product offerings and often rely on a limited number of suppliers for certain products this risk may be exacerbated there is growing evidence that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures weather and precipitation patterns growing and harvesting conditions and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters such as floods wildfires droughts and water scarcity to the extent such climate change effects have a negative impact on crop size and quality it could impact the availability and pricing of these natural products if we are unable to increase the prices to our customers of our products to offset raw material and other input cost increases or if we are unable to achieve cost savings to offset such cost increases we could fail to meet our cost expectations and our profits and operating results could be adversely affected increases in prices of our products to customers may lead to declines in sales volumes and we may not be able to accurately predict the volume impact of price increases which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

similarly commodities and energy prices are subject to significant volatility caused by among other things market fluctuations supply and demand currency fluctuations production and transportation disruptions climate change and weather conditions and other world events as we source many of our raw materials globally to help ensure quality control if the cost of energy shipping or transportation increases and we are unable to pass along these costs to our customers our profit margins would be adversely affected furthermore increasing our prices to our customers could result in longterm sales declines or loss of market share if our customers find alternative suppliers or choose to reformulate their consumer products to use fewer ingredients which could have an adverse longterm impact on our results of operations our ability to price our products competitively to timely reflect volatility in prices of raw material and ingredients is critical to maintain and grow our sales to mitigate our sourcing risk we maintain strategic stock levels for critical items however if we do not accurately estimate the amount of raw materials that will be used for the geographic region in which we will need these materials or competitively price our products our margins could be adversely affected 

a significant data breach or other disruption to our information technology systems could disrupt our operations result in the loss of confidential information or personal data and adversely impact our reputation business or results of operations 

we rely on information technology systems including some managed by thirdparty providers to conduct business and support our business processes including those relating to product formulas product development manufacturing sales order and invoice processing production distribution internal communications and communications with third parties throughout the world processing transactions summarizing and reporting results of operations complying with regulatory tax or legal requirements and collecting and storing customer supplier employee and other stakeholder information cyber security incidents data breaches and operational disruptions caused by cyberattacks or cyberintrusions are constantly evolving in nature becoming more sophisticated and are being made by groups and individuals with a wide range of expertise and motives 

including computer hackers foreign governments cyber terrorists cyber criminals and malicious employees or other insiders we and our thirdparty providers are subject to risks posed by such incidents which can take many forms including code anomalies “acts of god” data leakage hardware or software failures human error cyber extortion password theft or introduction of viruses malware ransomware including through phishing emails 

a disruption to our information technology systems could result in the loss of confidential business customer supplier or employee information litigation or fines and may require substantial investigations repairs or replacements or impact our ability to summarize and report financial results in a timely manner resulting in significant financial legal and relational costs and potentially harming our reputation and adversely impacting our operations customer service and results of operations because we do not currently have duplications of our information technology systems and we continue to work on upgrading and integrating frutarom’s systems into ours these risks may be exacerbated additionally a security or data breach could require us to devote significant management and financial resources to address the problems created these types of adverse impacts could also occur in the event the confidentiality integrity or availability of company customer supplier or employee information are compromised due to a data loss by us or a trusted third party we or the third parties with which we share information may not discover any such incidents and loss of information for a significant period of time after the incident occurs while we have security processes and initiatives in place we may be unable to detect or prevent a breach or disruption in the future additionally while we have insurance coverage designed to address certain aspects of cyber risks in place such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise 

if we fail to comply with data protection laws in the us and abroad we may be subject to fines penalties and other costs 

recently there has also been heightened regulatory and enforcement focus on data protection in the us at both the state and federal level and abroad and an actual or alleged failure to comply with applicable us or foreign data protection regulations or other data protection standards may expose us to litigation including in some instances class action litigation fines sanctions or other penalties which could harm our reputation and adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition this regulatory environment is increasingly challenging and may present material obligations and risks to our business including significantly expanded compliance burdens costs and enforcement risks for example the european union’s general data protection regulation “gdpr” which became effective in may 2018 greatly increases the jurisdictional reach of eu law and adds a broad array of requirements related to personal data including individual notice and optout preferences and the public disclosure of significant data breaches additionally violations of the gdpr can result in fines of as much as 4 of a company’s annual revenue other governments have enacted or are enacting similar data protection laws including data localization laws that require data to stay within their borders beginning in 2020 we will also be required to comply with certain additional requirements under the california consumer privacy act all of these evolving compliance and operational requirements as well as the uncertain interpretation and enforcement of laws impose significant costs and regulatory risks that are likely to increase over time our failure to comply with these evolving regulations could expose us to fines penalties and other costs that could adversely impact our financial results 

if we are unable to comply with regulatory requirements and industry standards including those regarding product safety quality efficacy and environmental impact we could incur significant costs and suffer reputational harm which could adversely affect results of operations 

the development manufacture and sale of our products are subject to various regulatory requirements in each of the countries in which our products are developed manufactured and sold in addition we are subject to product safety and compliance requirements established by governments industry or similar oversight bodies or contractually by our customers including requirements concerning product safety quality and efficacy environmental impacts including packaging energy and water use and waste management and other sustainability or similar issues we use a variety of strategies methodologies and tools to minimize the likelihood of product or process noncompliance with these regulations and standards by i identifying current product standards ii assessing relative risks in our supply chain iii monitoring internal and external performance and iv testing raw materials and finished goods as concerns regarding safety quality and environmental impact become more pressing we may see new more restrictive regulations adopted that impact our products for example the european chemicals agency has proposed that the european commission adopt a ban on microplastics including those found in personal care items detergents and cosmetics to reduce plastics pollution if this ban is adopted we will be required to modify our products andor innovate new solutions to replace microplastics in our products if we are unable to adapt to these new regulations or standards in a cost effective and timely manner we may lose business to competitors who are able to provide compliant products 

gaps in our operational processes or those of our suppliers or distributors can result in products that do not meet our quality control or industry standards or fail to comply with the relevant regulatory requirements which in turn can result in finished consumer goods that do not comply with applicable standards and requirements products that are mislabeled 

contaminated or damaged could result in a regulatory noncompliance event or even a product recall by the fda or a similar foreign agency our contracts often require us to indemnify our customers for the costs associated with a product noncompliance event including penalties costs and settlements arising from litigation remediation costs or loss of sales as our flavors and fragrance compounds and ingredients are used in many products intended for human use or consumption these consequences would be exacerbated if we or our customer did not identify the defect before the product reaches the consumer and there was a resulting impact at the consumer level such a result could lead to potentially large scale adverse publicity negative effects on consumer’s health recalls and potential litigation fines penalties sanctions or other regulatory actions in addition if we do not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification from suppliers or other third parties or if insurance or indemnification is not available the liability relating to product or possible thirdparty claims arising from mislabeled contaminated or damaged products could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations furthermore adverse publicity about our products or our customers’ products that contain our ingredients including concerns about product safety or similar issues whether real or perceived could harm our reputation and result in an immediate adverse effect on our sales and customer relationships as well as require us to utilize significant resources to rebuild our reputation 

increasing awareness of health and wellness are driving changes in the consumer products industry and if we are unable to react in a timely and costeffective manner our results of operations and future growth may be adversely affected 

we must continually anticipate and react in a timely and costeffective manner to changes in consumer preferences and demands including changes in demand driven by increasing awareness of health and wellness and demands for transparency or cleaner labels with respect to product ingredients by consumers and regulators consumers especially in developed economies such as the us and western europe are rapidly shifting away from products containing artificial ingredients to allnatural healthier alternatives in addition there has been a growing demand by consumers nongovernmental organizations and to a lesser extent governmental agencies to provide more transparency in product labeling and our customers have been taking steps to address this demand including by voluntarily providing productspecific ingredients disclosure these two trends could affect the types and volumes of our ingredients and compounds that our customers include in their consumer product offerings and therefore affect the demand for our products if we are unable to react to or anticipate these trends in a timely and costeffective manner our results of operations and future growth may be adversely affected 

we are subject to increasing customer consumer and regulatory focus on sustainability issues which may result in additional costs in order to meet new requirements or upgrade frutarom’s sustainability practices 

federal state local and foreign governments our customers and consumers are becoming increasingly sensitive to sustainability issues we have committed to a sustainability strategy designed to meet this global trend and are currently assessing our combined environmental footprint following the frutarom acquisition with the intent of identifying synergies gaps and opportunities in our sustainability efforts 

as part of our assessment so far we have begun upgrading frutarom’s sustainability practices to better align them to our legacy iff practices and which may require significant costs and time to implement our assessment may reveal additional gaps between the legacy frutarom operations and our sustainability practices and goals which may require significant costs to remedy 

despite our efforts the increased focus on sustainability may result in new regulations and customer requirements that could negatively affect us these could cause us to incur additional direct costs or to make changes to our operations in order to comply with any new regulations and customer requirements we could also lose revenue if our customers divert business from us because we have not complied with their sustainability requirements or if we are not successful in improving frutarom’s sustainability metrics these potential costs changes and loss of revenue could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we have made investments in and continue to expand our business into emerging markets which exposes us to certain risks 

as part of our growth strategy we have increased our presence in emerging markets by expanding our manufacturing presence sales organization and product offerings in these markets and we expect to continue to expand our business in these markets with our acquisition of frutarom in 2018 who also had a significant presence in emerging markets our business in these markets has meaningfully grown in addition to the currency and international risks described below our operations in these markets may be subject to a variety of other risks emerging markets typically have a consumer base with limited or fluctuating disposable income and customer demand in these markets may fluctuate accordingly as a result decrease in customer demand in emerging markets may have an adverse effect on our ability to execute our growth strategy 

further there is no assurance that our existing products variants of our existing products or new products that we make manufacture distribute or sell will be accepted or be successful in any particular developing or emerging market due to local or global competition product price cultural differences consumer preferences or otherwise in addition emerging markets may have weak legal systems which may affect our ability to enforce our intellectual property and contractual rights exchange controls unstable governments and privatization or other government actions that may affect taxes subsidies and incentive programs and the flow of goods and currency in conducting our business we move products from one country to another and may provide services in one country from a subsidiary located in another country accordingly we are vulnerable to abrupt changes in trade customs and tax regimes in these markets if we are unable to expand our business in developing and emerging markets effectively operate or manage the risks associated with operating in these markets or achieve the return on capital we expect from our investments in these markets our operating results and future growth could be adversely affected 

the impact of currency fluctuation or devaluation in the international markets in which we operate may negatively affect our results of operations 

we have significant operations outside the us the results of which are reported in the local currency and then translated into us dollars at applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements the exchange rates between these currencies and the us dollar have fluctuated and will continue to do so in the future for example as of july 1 2018 we concluded that argentina’s economy is highly inflationary under us gaap as it has experienced cumulative inflation of approximately 100 or more over a threeyear period while our current operations in argentina represent less than 3 of our consolidated net sales and less than 1 of our consolidated total assets continuing inflation in argentina could adversely affect our profitability in a specific period changes in exchange rates between these local currencies and the us dollar will affect the recorded levels of sales profitability assets andor liabilities additionally volatility in currency exchange rates may adversely impact our financial condition cash flows or liquidity although we employ a variety of techniques to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations including sourcing strategies and a limited number of foreign currency hedging activities we cannot guarantee that such hedging and risk management strategies will be effective and our results of operations could be adversely affected 

our international operations are subject to regulatory political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

we operate on a global basis with manufacturing and sales facilities in the us europe africa the middle east latin america and greater asia during 2019 80 of our combined net sales were to customers outside the us and we intend to continue expansion of our international operations as a result our business is increasingly exposed to risks inherent in international operations these risks which can vary substantially by location include the following 

• governmental laws regulations and policies adopted to manage national economic and macroeconomic conditions such as increases in taxes austerity measures that may impact consumer spending monetary policies that may impact inflation rates employment regulations currency fluctuations or controls and sustainability of resources 

• changes in environmental health and safety regulations such as the continued implementation of the european union’s reach regulations and similar regulations that are being evaluated and adopted in other markets and the burdens and costs of our compliance with such regulations which may differ significantly across jurisdictions 

• increased environmental health and safety regulations or the loss of necessary environmental permits in certain countries 

• the imposition of or changes in customs tariffs quotas trade barriers other trade protection measures import or export licensing requirements and sanctions on trade with certain countries imposed by the us or other countries which could adversely affect our cost or ability to import raw materials or export our flavors and fragrance products to surrounding markets 

• risks and costs arising from our ability to cater to local demand and customer preferences language and cultural differences 

• changes in the laws and policies that govern foreign investment in the countries in which we operate including the risk of expropriation or nationalization the costs and ability to repatriate the profit that we generate in these countries 

• risks and costs associated with complying with antimoney laundering and counterterrorism financing laws 

• risks and costs associated with political and economic instability bribery and corruption antiamerican sentiment and social and ethnic unrest in the countries in which we operate 

• difficulty in recruiting and retaining trained local personnel 

• natural disasters global or local health crisis such as the recent coronavirus outbreak pandemics epidemics or international conflicts including terrorist acts political crisis national and regional labor strikes in the countries in which we operate which could endanger our personnel interrupt our operations or adversely affect the demand for our products the results of certain regions or our global supply chain or 

• the risks of operating in developing or emerging markets in which there are significant uncertainties regarding the interpretation application and enforceability of laws and regulations and the enforceability of contract rights and intellectual property rights 

the occurrence of any one or more of these factors could increase our costs and adversely affect our results of operations 

economic uncertainty may adversely affect demand for our products which may have a negative impact on our operating results and future growth 

our flavors and fragrance compounds and our fragrance cosmetic active and functional food ingredients are components of a wide assortment of global consumer products throughout the world historically demand for consumer products using these compounds and ingredients was stimulated and broadened by changing social habits and consumer needs population growth an expanding global middleclass and general economic growth especially in emerging markets the global economy has experienced significant recessionary pressures and declines in consumer confidence and economic growth while some segments of the global economy appear to be recovering the predictions surrounding the global recessionary economic environment in europe has and may in the near future increase unemployment and underemployment decrease salaries and wage rates increase inflation or result in other marketwide cost pressures that will adversely affect demand for consumer products in both developed and emerging markets in addition growth rates in the emerging markets have moderated from previous levels reduced consumer spending may cause changes in our customer orders including reduced demand for our flavors and fragrances compounds or ingredients or order cancellations the timing of placing of orders and the amounts of these orders are generally at our customers’ discretion customers may cancel reduce or postpone orders with us on relatively short notice significant cancellations reductions or delays in orders by customers could affect our quarterly results it is currently anticipated that these challenging economic uncertainties will continue to affect certain of our markets during 2020 which could adversely affect our sales profitability and overall operating results 

failure to comply with environmental protection laws may cause us to close relocate or operate one or more of our plants at reduced production levels and expose us to civil or criminal liability which could adversely affect our operating results and future growth 

our business operations and properties procure make use of manufacture sell and distribute substances that are sometimes considered hazardous and are therefore subject to extensive and increasingly stringent federal state local and foreign laws and regulations pertaining to protection of the environment including air emissions sewage discharges the use of hazardous materials waste disposal practices and cleanup of existing environmental contamination failure to comply with these laws and regulations or any future changes to them may result in significant consequences to us including the need to close or relocate one or more of our production facilities administrative civil and criminal penalties fines sanctions litigation costly remediation measures liability for damages and negative publicity if we are unable to meet production requirements we can lose customer orders which can adversely affect our future growth or we may be required to make incremental capital investments to ensure supply for example we recently completed negotiations with the chinese government concerning the relocation of a second fragrance facility in china idling of facilities or production modifications has caused or may cause customers to seek alternate suppliers due to concerns regarding supply interruptions and these customers may not return or may order at reduced levels even once issues are remediated if these noncompliance issues reoccur in china or occur or in any other jurisdiction we may lose business and may be required to incur capital spending above previous expectations close a plant or operate a plant at significantly reduced production levels on a permanent basis and our operating results and cash flows from operations may be adversely affected 

our performance may be adversely impacted if we are not successful in managing our inventory andor working capital balances 

we evaluate our inventory balances of materials based on shelf life expected sourcing levels known uses and anticipated demand based on forecasted customer order activity and changes in our productsales mix efficient inventory management is a key component of our business success financial returns and profitability to be successful we must maintain sufficient inventory levels and an appropriate productsales mix to meet our customers’ demands without allowing those levels to increase to such an extent that the costs associated with storing and holding other inventory adversely impact our financial results if our buying decisions do not accurately predict sourcing levels customer trends or our expectations about customer 

needs are inaccurate we may have to take unanticipated markdowns or impairment charges to dispose of the excess or obsolete inventory which can adversely impact our financial results additionally we believe excess inventory levels of raw materials with a short shelf life in our manufacturing facilities subjects us to the risk of increased inventory shrinkage if we are not successful in managing our inventory balances and shrinkage our results of and cash flows from operations may be negatively affected 

we sell certain accounts receivable on a nonrecourse basis to unrelated financial institutions under “factoring” agreements that are sponsored solely and individually by certain customers the cost of participating in these programs was immaterial to our results in all periods should we choose not to participate or if these programs were no longer available it could reduce our cash flows from operations in the period in which the arrangement ends 

we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act or similar us or foreign antibribery and anticorruption laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate 

the global nature of our business the significance of our international revenue and our focus on emerging markets create various domestic and local regulatory challenges and subject us to risks associated with our international operations the us foreign corrupt practices act or fcpa and similar antibribery and anticorruption laws and regulations in other countries generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or for other commercial advantage in addition us public companies are required to maintain records that accurately and fairly represent their transactions and have an adequate system of internal accounting controls under the fcpa us companies may be held liable for the corrupt actions taken by directors officers employees agents or other strategic or local partners or representatives as such if we or our intermediaries fail to comply with the requirements of the fcpa or similar legislation governmental authorities in the us and elsewhere could seek to impose substantial civil andor criminal fines and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation operating results and financial condition 

we operate or may pursue opportunities in some jurisdictions such as china india brazil russia and africa that pose potentially elevated risks of fraud or corruption or increased risk of internal control issues in certain jurisdictions compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices from time to time we have conducted and will conduct internal investigations of the relevant facts and circumstances control testing and compliance reviews and take remedial actions when appropriate to help ensure that we are in compliance with applicable corruption and similar laws and regulations for example in august 2019 during the integration of frutarom we were made aware of allegations that two frutarom businesses operating principally in russia and ukraine made certain improper payments including to representatives of a number of customers our investigation substantiated the allegations that improper payments to representatives of customers were made and that key members of frutarom’s senior management at the time were aware of such payments we did not uncover any evidence suggesting that such payments had any connection to the us in addition frutarom grew through rapid acquisition and as part of our integration efforts we are implementing our anti corruption and similar policies throughout a number of those acquired companies many of which were not previously subject to these us laws 

detecting investigating and resolving actual or alleged violations of the fcpa or other antibribery and anticorruption laws and regulations is expensive could consume significant time and attention of our senior management and could subject us to investigations and inquiries by governmental and other regulatory bodies any allegations of non compliance with such laws and regulations could have a disruptive effect on our operations in such jurisdiction including interruptions of business or loss of thirdparty relationships which may negatively impact our results of operations or financial condition any determination that our operations or activities are not in compliance with such laws and regulations could expose us to severe criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions significant fines termination of necessary 

licenses and permits and penalties or other sanctions that may harm our business and reputation 

any impairment of our tangible or intangible longlived assets including goodwill may adversely impact our profitability 

a significant portion of our assets consists of longlived assets including tangible assets such as our manufacturing facilities and intangible assets including goodwill as a result of numerous recent acquisitions including the 2018 acquisition of frutarom as of december 31 2019 we had recorded approximately 83 billion of intangible assets and goodwill including 43 billion of goodwill associated with the acquisition of frutarom our results of operations and financial position in future periods could be negatively impacted should future impairments of our longlived assets including intangible assets or goodwill occur 

at least annually we assess both goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment we test for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount if the carrying amount of a reporting unit 

exceeds its estimated fair value we record an impairment charge based on the difference of the two intangible assets with finite lives are also tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable such events and changes in circumstances could include a sustained decrease in our market capitalization increased competition or unexpected loss of market share increased input costs beyond projections for example due to regulatory or industry changes our inability to recognize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions unexpected business disruptions for example due to a natural disaster or loss of a customer supplier or other significant business relationship acts by governments and courts operating results falling short of projections or significant adverse changes in the markets in which we operate 

fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions estimates and market factors estimating the fair value of reporting units requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our business performance future plans future annual net cash flows income tax considerations discount rates growth rates and based on industry economic regulatory conditions and other market factors to the extent any of our acquisitions including the acquisition of frutarom do not perform as anticipated and our underlying assumptions and estimates related to their fair value determination are not met whether due to internal or external factors the value of such assets may be negatively affected and we may be required to record impairment charges 

our ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights 

we rely on patents and trade secrets to protect our intellectual property rights we often rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary fragrance and flavor formulations as well as our extract methodologies and processes for our nutrition natural colors for food and natural antioxidants for food protection as this does not require us to publicly file information regarding our intellectual property from time to time a third party may claim that we have infringed upon or misappropriated their intellectual property rights or a third party may infringe upon or misappropriate our intellectual property rights we could incur significant costs in connection with legal actions to assert our intellectual property rights against third parties or to defend ourselves from thirdparty assertions of invalidity infringement misappropriation or other claims any settlement or adverse judgment resulting from such litigation could require us to obtain a license to continue to use the intellectual property rights that are the subject of the claim or otherwise restrict or prohibit our use of such intellectual property rights any required licensing fees may not be available to us on acceptable terms if at all for those intellectual property rights that are protected as trade secrets this litigation could result in even higher costs and potentially the loss of certain rights since we would not have a perfected intellectual property right that precludes others from making using or selling our products or processes the ongoing trend among our customers towards more transparent labeling could further diminish our ability to effectively protect our proprietary flavor formulations 

for intellectual property rights that we seek to protect through patents we cannot be certain that these rights if obtained will not later be opposed invalidated or circumvented in addition even if such rights are obtained in the us the laws of some of the other countries in which our products are or may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us if other parties were to infringe on our intellectual property rights or if a third party successfully asserted that we had infringed on their intellectual property rights it could materially and adversely affect our future results of operations by among other things i reducing the price that we could obtain in the marketplace for products which are based on such rights ii increasing the royalty or other fees that we may be required to pay in connection with such rights iii limiting the volume if any of such products that we can sell or iv resulting in significant litigation costs and potential liability 

our results of operations may be negatively impacted by the outcome of uncertainties related to litigation 

from time to time we are involved in a number of legal claims regulatory investigations and litigation including claims related to intellectual property product liability environmental matters and indirect taxes for instance product liability claims may arise due to the fact that we supply flavors and fragrances to the food and beverage functional food pharmanutraceutical and personal care industries our manufacturing and other facilities may expose us to environmental claims and regulatory investigations in addition as we expand our product offering into functional food nutraceuticals and natural antioxidants we may also be subject to claims of false or deceptive advertising claims in the us europe and other foreign jurisdictions in which we offer these types of products these claims can arise as a result of function claims health claims nutrient content claims and other claims that impermissibly suggest therapeutic benefits for certain foods or food components the cost of defending these claims or our obligations for direct damages and indemnification if we were found liable could adversely affect our results of operations 

as a result of the acquisition of frutarom we assumed a number of legal claims regulatory investigations and litigation and we may become involved in additional actions in the future arising from the acquired operations specifically as frutarom has a significantly greater number of facilities that are located globally and a significantly larger number of customers our 

exposure to these types of environmental claims product liability claims and regulatory investigations may increase this could result in an increase in our cost for defense or settlement of claims or indemnification obligations if we were to be found liable in excess of our historical experience 

in addition we are also the subject of a putative shareholder class action lawsuit filed in august 2019 after we disclosed that preliminary results of investigations indicated that frutarom businesses operating principally in russia and ukraine had made improper payments to representatives of customers 

our insurance may not be adequate to protect us from all material expenses related to pending and future claims and our current levels of insurance may not be available in the future at commercially reasonable prices any of these factors could adversely affect our profitability and results of operations 

our funding obligations for our pension and postretirement plans could adversely affect our earnings and cash flows 

the funding obligations for our pension plans are impacted by the performance of the financial markets particularly the equity markets and interest rates funding obligations are determined under government regulations and are measured each year based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date if the financial markets do not provide the longterm returns that are expected under the governmental funding calculations we could be required to make larger contributions the equity markets can be very volatile and therefore our estimate of future contribution requirements can change dramatically in relatively short periods of time similarly changes in interest rates and legislation enacted by governmental authorities can impact the timing and amounts of contribution requirements an adverse change in the funded status of the plans could significantly increase our required contributions in the future and adversely impact our liquidity 

assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans are determined by us in consultation with outside consultants and advisors in the event that we determine that changes are warranted in the assumptions used such as the discount rate expected longterm rate of return on assets or expected health care costs our future pension and postretirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease due to changing market conditions or changes in the participant population the assumptions that we use may differ from actual results which could have a significant impact on our pension and postretirement liabilities and related costs and funding requirements 

changes in our tax rates the adoption of new us or international tax legislation or changes in existing tax laws could expose us to additional tax liabilities that may affect our future results 

we are subject to taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in liabilities for uncertain tax positions cost of repatriations or changes in tax laws or their interpretation any of these changes could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 

we have and will continue to implement transfer pricing policies among our various operations located in different countries these transfer pricing policies are a significant component of the management and compliance of our operations across international boundaries and overall financial results many countries routinely examine transfer pricing policies of taxpayers subject to their jurisdiction challenge transfer pricing policies aggressively where there is potential noncompliance and impose significant interest charges and penalties where noncompliance is determined however governmental authorities could challenge these policies more aggressively in the future and if challenged we may not prevail we could suffer significant costs related to one or more challenges to our transfer pricing policies 

we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and foreign tax authorities in those countries in which we operate and we may be subject to assessments or audits in the future in any of the countries in which we operate the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals and while we do not believe the results that follow would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition such results could have a material effect on our income tax provision net income or cash flows in the period or periods in which that determination is made 

in addition a number of international legislative and regulatory bodies have proposed legislation and begun investigations of the tax practices of multinational companies and in the european union the tax policies of certain european union member states one of these efforts has been led by the organisation for economic cooperation and development an international association of 34 countries including the us which has finalized recommendations to revise corporate tax transfer pricing and tax treaty provisions in member countries since 2013 the european commission “ec” has been investigating tax rulings granted by tax authorities in a number of european union member states with respect to specific 

multinational corporations to determine whether such rulings comply with european union rules on state aid as well as more recent investigations of the tax regimes of certain european union member states under european union law selective tax advantages for particular taxpayers that are not sufficiently grounded in economic realities may constitute impermissible state aid if the ec determines that a tax ruling or tax regime violates the state aid restrictions the tax authorities of the affected european union member state may be required to collect back taxes for the period of time covered by the ruling in late 2015 and early 2016 the ec declared that tax rulings related to other companies by tax authorities in luxembourg the netherlands and belgium did not comply with the european union state aid restrictions if the ec or tax authorities in other jurisdictions were to successfully challenge tax rulings applicable to us in any of the member states in which we are subject to taxation or our internal intercompany arrangements we could be exposed to increased tax liabilities 

in december 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” that significantly revised the us tax code effective january 1 2018 by among other things lowering the corporate income tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35 to a flat 21 limiting deductibility of interest expense and performance based incentive compensation transitioning to a territorial system and creating new taxes associated with global operations the tax act impacted our consolidated results of operations during 2019 and is expected to continue to impact our consolidated results of operations in future periods in future periods we expect that our effective tax rate will be impacted by the lower us corporate tax rate that will initially be offset by the elimination of the deductibility of performancebased incentive compensation and other provisions of the tax act that may impact us prospectively however the ultimate impact of the tax act will depend on additional regulatory or accounting guidance that may be issued with respect to the tax act and any operating and structural changes that we may undertake to permit us to benefit from the new lower us tax rate prospectively this could adversely affect our results of operations 

our business may be negatively impacted as a result of the united kingdom’s departure from the european union 

we currently manufacture goods in the united kingdom for distribution in the european union and viceversa and therefore may be adversely affected as a result of the united kingdom’s departure from the european union “brexit” in 2020 the impact of the withdrawal could among other outcomes exacerbate the disruption of the free movement of goods services and people between the united kingdom and the european union undermine bilateral cooperation in key geographic areas and significantly disrupt trade between the united kingdom and the european union or other nations as the united kingdom pursues independent trade relations in addition brexit has caused legal uncertainty which could last indefinitely and may potentially create divergent national laws and regulations as the united kingdom determines which european union laws to replace or replicate given the lack of comparable precedent it is unclear what the financial trade and legal implications of the withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union will be and how the withdrawal will affect us adverse consequences concerning brexit or the european union could include deterioration in global economic conditions instability in global financial markets political uncertainty volatility in currency exchange rates or adverse changes in the crossborder agreements currently in place any of which could have an adverse impact on our financial results in the future 

the expected phase out of the london interbank office rate libor could impact the interest rates paid on our variable rate indebtedness and cause our interest expense to increase 

in 2017 the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority which regulates libor announced that it intends to phase out libor by the end of 2021 currently there is no definitive information regarding the future utilization of libor or of any particular replacement rate borrowings under our revolving credit facility and term loan are at variable interest rates based on libor if libor is no longer available or if our lenders have increased costs due to changes in libor we may need to amend our debt facilities to replace libor with an agreed upon replacement index which could result in higher rates and adversely impact our interest expense 

risks relating to our pending combination with nutrition and biosciences inc “nb” 

as previously announced on december 15 2019 we entered into among other agreements an agreement and plan of merger the “merger agreement” with dupont pursuant to which subject to closing conditions customary for a transaction of this type we will combine with dupont’s nutrition and biosciences business the “nb business” upon completion of our combination with the nb business the “nb transaction” dupont shareholders will own approximately 554 of the shares of iff and existing iff shareholders will own approximately 446 of the shares of iff a proxy statementprospectus on form s4 is expected to be filed with the sec pursuant to which iff shareholders will be asked to approve the share issuance required to effect the nb transaction 

we will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the nb transaction is pending that may have a negative impact on our business 

uncertainty about the effect of the pending nb transaction may have a negative impact on our business including relationships with our customers suppliers and employees these uncertainties may impair our ability to retain and motivate key personnel and could cause customers and others that deal with us to defer or decline entering into contracts with us or making other decisions concerning us or seek to change existing business relationships with us in addition if key employees depart because of uncertainty about their future roles and the potential complexities of the transaction our business could be harmed furthermore the merger agreement contains restrictions on our ability to take certain actions outside the ordinary course of business prior to the closing of the transaction which may delay or prevent us from undertaking certain actions or business opportunities that may arise prior to the closing for more information see the merger agreement incorporated by reference as an exhibit in this annual report on form 10k 

we have incurred and will incur substantial direct and indirect costs as well as additional debt as a result of the nb transaction 

we have incurred and will incur substantial expenses in connection with and as a result of completing the nb transaction including financial advisory legal accounting consulting and other advisory fees and expenses regulatory filings and filing and printing fees as well as additional debt thereby significantly increasing our leverage our leverage and required payments may adversely affect our credit rating cash flows operating results or our ability to return capital to our shareholders and the additional debt instruments may subject us to additional covenants 

in addition over a period of time following the closing we expect to incur substantial expenses in connection with transitioning integrating and coordinating the businesses operations policies and procedures of us and the nb business a portion of the transaction costs related to the transaction will be incurred regardless of whether the transaction is completed while we have assumed that a certain level of transaction expenses will be incurred factors beyond our control could affect the total amount or the timing of these expenses many of the expenses that will be incurred by their nature are difficult to estimate accurately these costs could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations prior to the transaction and of the combined businesses following the transaction 

the merger agreement limits our ability to pursue alternatives to the nb transaction 

the merger agreement contains provisions that make it more difficult for us to enter into alternative transactions and provisions that restrict our ability to among other things solicit initiate or knowingly facilitate or encourage the submission of inquiries regarding or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition proposal from a third party while we believe these provisions are reasonable and customary for transactions of this type the provisions might discourage a third party that has an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of us from considering or proposing such acquisition even if such party were prepared to pay consideration with a higher pershare value than the currently proposed transaction consideration 

the requirement to obtain governmental approvals to satisfy the conditions to the completion of the nb transaction may delay or prevent completion of the transaction 

the completion of the nb transaction is conditioned upon the receipt of certain governmental authorizations consents orders or other approvals including the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the hartscottrodino antitrust improvements act of 1976 as amended iff and dupont intend to pursue all required approvals in accordance with the merger agreement these approvals may impose conditions on or require divestitures relating to the operations or assets of iff or the nb business and such conditions or divestitures may jeopardize or delay the completion of the transaction or may reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction further no assurance can be given that the required approvals will be obtained and even if all such approvals are obtained no assurance can be given as to the terms conditions and timing of the approvals or whether they will satisfy the terms of the merger agreement 

if we fail to complete the nb transaction our business financial results and stock price could be negatively impacted 

the closing of the nb transaction is subject to numerous conditions if the nb transaction is not completed our ongoing business may be adversely affected and we will be subject to several risks and consequences including the following 

• we may be required under certain circumstances to pay a termination fee of 5215 million or to reimburse dupont’s transactionrelated expenses in an amount up to 75 million 

• we will be required to pay certain costs relating to the transaction whether or not the transaction is completed such as significant fees and expenses relating to financial advisory legal accounting consulting and other advisory fees and expenses regulatory filings and filing and printing fees and 

• matters relating to the transaction may require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management and the expenditure of significant funds in the form of fees and expenses which could otherwise have been devoted to daytoday operations and other opportunities that may have been beneficial to us 

in addition if the nb transaction is not completed we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from our employees clients and customers we could also be subject to litigation including litigation related to failure to complete the transaction or to enforce our obligations under the merger agreement if the nb transaction is not consummated there can be no assurance that the risks described above will not materially affect our business financial results and stock price 

the integration of the nb business with iff may present significant challenges and we may not realize anticipated synergies and other benefits of the nb transaction 

the combination of independent businesses is complex costly and timeconsuming and combining our and the nb business’ practices and operations may divert significant management attention and resources and disrupt our business the failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating the businesses and to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction could cause an interruption of or a loss of momentum in our business activities and could adversely affect our results of operations the overall combination of our business and the nb business may also result in material unanticipated problems expenses liabilities competitive responses and loss of customer and other business relationships the difficulties of integration include among others 

• the diversion of management attention to integration matters 

• integrating operations and systems including intellectual property and communications systems administrative and information technology infrastructure and financial reporting and internal control systems some of which may prove to be incompatible 

• conforming standards controls procedures and accounting and other policies business cultures and compensation structures between the businesses 

• integrating employees and attracting and retaining key personnel including talent 

• retaining existing and obtaining new customers and suppliers 

• managing the expanded operations of a significantly larger and more complex company 

• contingent liabilities that are larger than expected and 

• potential unknown liabilities adverse consequences and unforeseen increased expenses associated with the transaction 

many of these factors are outside of our control andor will be outside the control of the nb business and any one of them could result in lower revenues higher costs and diversion of management time and energy which could materially impact the business financial condition and results of operations of our business 

in addition even if the operations of our business and the nb business are integrated successfully the full benefits of the transaction may not be realized including among others the synergies cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that are expected these benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all further additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of our business and the nb business all of these factors could cause dilution to the earnings per share of iff decrease or delay the projected accretive effect of the transaction and negatively impact the price of iff common stock following the transaction 

current iff shareholders’ percentage ownership interest in iff will be substantially diluted in the nb transaction 

the iff common stock outstanding on a fullydiluted basis immediately prior to the nb transaction will represent in the aggregate approximately 446 of iff common stock outstanding on a fullydiluted basis immediately following the transaction consequently iff’s pretransaction equity holders as a group will be substantially diluted in the transaction and have less ability to exercise influence over the management and policies of iff following the transaction

2019 financial performance overview 

sales 

sales in 2019 increased 29 on a reported basis and 32 on a currency neutral basis which excludes the effects of changes in currency with the effects of the frutarom acquisition contributing approximately 28 to reported growth rates and 29 to currency neutral growth rates taste reported sales growth was flat but currency neutral sales grew 2  scent achieved sales growth of 2 on a reported basis and 4 on a currency neutral basis in 2019  the impact of an additional week of sales or a 53rd week in 2019 contributed approximately 1 to reported and currency neutral sales growth consolidated reported 

and currency neutral sales growth was driven by additional sales from our acquisition of frutarom and to a lesser extent new win performance net of losses in scent 

from a geographic perspective north america noam europe africa and middle east eame greater asia ga and latin america la all delivered sales growth on a consolidated basis led by the frutarom acquisition 

exchange rate variations had an unfavorable impact on net sales for 2019 of 3  the effect of exchange rates can vary by business and region depending upon the mix of sales priced in us dollars as compared to other currencies 

our 25 largest customers accounted for 38 of total sales in 2019  in 2019 no customer accounted for more than 10 of sales a key factor for commercial success is inclusion on our strategic customers’ core supplier lists which provides opportunities to win new business we are on the core supplier lists of a large majority of our global and strategic customers within taste and scent 

gross margin 

gross margin decreased 120 basis points bps yearoveryear driven principally by lower margins in our frutarom business unit and higher raw material costs which were partially offset by cost savings and productivity initiatives 

operating profit 

operating profit increased 814 million to 6653 million  129 of sales in 2019 compared to 5839 million  147 of sales in 2018  included in 2019 were 1278 million of charges related to operational improvement initiatives integration related costs restructuring and other charges net losses on sale of assets fda mandated product recall compliance review costs frutarom acquisition related costs and nb transaction related costs the comparable period in 2018 included 935 million of charges related to operational improvement initiatives integration related costs restructuring and other charges net and frutarom acquisition related costs which were partially offset by acquisition related costs gains on sale of assets and recoveries related to the fda mandated product recall excluding these charges adjusted operating profit was 7931 million for 2019  an increase from 6774 million for 2018  principally driven by the inclusion of frutaroms operating profit for a full year in 2019 compared to one quarter in 2018 productivity initiatives and volume increases on existing business partially offset by price to input costs including the net impact of the basf supply chain disruption in 2018 and unfavorable foreign exchange rates 

excluding the above charges adjusted operating profit as a percentage of sales decreased to 154 for 2019 compared to 170 for 2018  principally driven by lower margins in our frutarom business and price to input costs including the net impact of the basf supply chain disruption in 2018 partially offset by productivity initiatives foreign currency had a 2 

unfavorable impact on operating profit in the 2019 period compared to a 3 favorable impact on operating profit in the 2018 period 

restructuring and other charges net 

restructuring and other charges net increased to 298 million in 2019 compared to 51 million in 2018  this increase was primarily driven by costs incurred in 2019 related to our frutarom integration initiative and 2019 severance program including severance costs related to outsourcing the it function 

cash flows provided by operating activities 

cash flows provided by operations were 6990 million or 136 of sales in 2019 as compared to cash flows provided by operations of 4376 million  or 110 of sales during 2018  the increase in operating cash flows from 2018 to 2019 was principally driven by higher earnings from inclusion of our frutarom acquisition and lower net working capital principally related to accounts receivable  

our capital spend was 2360 million  46 of sales during 2019  in light of our requirement to relocate one of our fragrance ingredients facilities in china the ongoing construction of new facilities in india and indonesia and capital requirements to integrate our recently acquired frutarom business we expect that capital spending in 2020 will be about 4 5 of sales net of potential grants and other reimbursements from government authorities

2019 in comparison to 2018 

sales 

sales for 2019 totaled 51 billion  an increase of 29 from the prior year on a reported basis and 32 on a currency neutral basis the frutarom acquisition contributed 28 on a reported basis and 29 on a currency neutral basis the impact of an additional week of sales or a 53rd week in 2019 contributed approximately 1 to reported and currency neutral sales growth sales growth primarily reflected the additional sales from our acquisition of frutarom and to a lesser extent new win performance net of losses in scent 

sales performance by segment was as follows 



 

 taste 

taste sales in 2019 were flat on a reported basis and increased 2 on a currency neutral basis versus the prior year period currency neutral performance was driven by new wins net of losses which was partially offset by volume reductions on existing business currency neutral sales growth was primarily driven by ga new wins net of losses and volume increases on existing business 

scent 

scent sales in 2019 increased 2 on a reported basis and 4 on a currency neutral basis reported and currency neutral sales growth primarily reflected new win performance net of losses which were partially offset by volume reductions on existing business 

sales growth in the scent business unit was led by fine fragrances and consumer fragrances which both were primarily driven by new win performance net of losses partially offset by volume reductions on existing business 

frutarom 

frutarom sales in 2019 were 15 billion  which included approximately 11 billion in sales of flavor compounds and approximately 367 million in sales of ingredient product categories we completed our acquisition of frutarom on october 4 2018 and therefore the year over year sales growth has been excluded from the above table 

reported and currency neutral sales for the fourth quarter of 2019 grew 4 and 6 respectively primarily driven by growth in the flavor compounds product category 

cost of goods sold 

cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales increased 120 bps to 589 in 2019 compared to 577 in 2018  principally driven by lower margins in our frutarom business unit and unfavorable price versus input costs which were partially offset by cost savings and productivity initiatives 

research and development rd 

overall rd expenses as a percentage of sales decreased to 67 in 2019 compared to 78 in 2018  the decrease as a percentage of sales in 2019 was principally due to lower rd expenses in our frutarom segment as a percentage of sales 

selling and administrative sa 

sa expenses increased 1687 million to 8761 million  or 170 as a percentage of sales in 2019 compared to 7075 million  or 178 as a percentage of sales in 2018  

included in 2019 was integration related costs of 535 million  nb transaction related costs of 207 million  compliance review and legal defense costs of 113 million and frutarom acquisition related costs of 17 million  compared to frutarom acquisition related costs of 661 million and integration related costs of 61 million  partially offset by acquisition related costs of 13 million in 2018  excluding these costs adjusted sa expense increased by 1523 million  but decreased to 153 of sales in 2019 compared to 160 of sales in 2018  the slight decrease as a percentage of sales was due to a decline in personnel related costs and the impact of our acquisition of frutarom partially offset by income related to certain brazil tax credits 

during the fourth quarter of 2019 we recognized 80 million in income related to the expected recoveries of previously paid indirect taxes in brazil from the period from 2011 to 2018 that have been subject to litigation between us and certain tax authorities the amount has been recorded in selling and administrative expense 

restructuring and other charges 

frutarom integration initiative 

in connection with the acquisition of frutarom we began to execute an integration plan that among other initiatives seeks to optimize its manufacturing network as part of the frutarom integration initiative we expect to close approximately 35 manufacturing sites over the next two years with most of the closures targeted to occur before the end of fiscal 2020  during 2019  we announced the closure of 10 facilities of which six facilities are in europe africa and middle east two facilities in latin america and one facility in each north america and greater asia regions since the inception of the initiative we have expensed 104 million  total costs for the program are expected to be approximately 65 million including cash and noncash items 

2019 severance charges 

during 2019 the company incurred severance charges related to approximately 330 headcount reductions the headcount reductions primarily related to the scent business unit and outsourcing of certain it functions with additional amounts related to headcount reductions in all business units associated with the establishment of a new shared service center in europe since the inception of the program the company has expensed 213 million  total costs for the program are expected to be approximately 25 million

amortization of acquisitionrelated intangibles 

amortization expenses increased to 1931 million in 2019 compared to 759 million in 2018  the increase of 1172 million was principally driven by the impact of the frutarom acquisition in 2018 

operating results by business unit 

we evaluate the performance of business units based on segment profit which is defined as operating profit before restructuring and certain nonrecurring items interest expense other expense net and taxes on income see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for the reconciliation to income before taxes   



taste business unit 

taste segment profit decreased 126 million to 3826 million  221 of segment sales in 2019 from 3952 million  227 of segment sales in the comparable 2018 period the decrease in segment profit principally reflected 

higher raw material costs and unfavorable manufacturing variances partially offset by the benefit of cost savings and productivity initiatives 

scent business unit 

scent segment profit increased 40 million to 3335 million  173 of segment sales in 2019  compared to 3295 million  175 of segment sales reported in 2018  segment profit as a percentage of sales included the impact of unfavorable price versus input costs partially offset by the benefit of cost savings and productivity initiatives

global expenses represent corporate and headquarterrelated expenses which include legal finance human resources and rd and other administrative expenses that are not allocated to an individual business unit in 2019  global expenses were 498 million compared to 747 million during 2018  the decrease was principally driven by higher gains from our currency hedging program in the current year and lower incentive compensation expense in 2019 

interest expense 

in 2019  interest expense increased 57 million to 1382 million  compared to 1326 million in 2018 primarily driven by a full year of interest expense in 2019 related to the september 2018 debt issuances partially offset by 471 million of fees and interest incurred in the third quarter of 2018 in connection with the acquisition of frutarom average cost of debt was 30 for the 2019 period compared to 43 in 2018

other income expense net 

other income net decreased approximately 48 million to 304 million of income in 2019 versus 352 million of income in 2018  the decrease was primarily driven by higher losses on foreign exchange and higher pension related expenses offset by higher investment income in 2019 as well as income related to the realization of a deferred gain on the government imposed relocation of a site in china 

income taxes 

the effective tax rate was 174 in 2019 as compared to 241 in 2018  the yearoveryear decrease was largely due to a more favorable mix of earnings and the absence of the 328 million charge in 2018 associated with a change in our assertion under apb 23 partially offset by loss provisions the establishment of a valuation allowance against certain us state deferred taxes and the absence of the reversal of certain valuation allowances on us state deferred taxes that benefited 2018 

excluding the 262 million tax benefit associated with the pretax operational improvement initiatives integration related costs restructuring and other charges net losses on sale of assets fda mandated product recall frutarom acquisition related costs compliance review  legal defense costs and nb transaction related costs the adjusted effective tax rate for 2019 was 181  for 2018  the adjusted effective tax rate was 184 excluding the 40 million tax benefit associated with the pretax restructuring operational improvement initiatives integration related costs and frutarom acquisition related costs which were partially offset by the tax charge associated with acquisitionrelated costs gains on sales of fixed assets fda mandated product recall costs and the impact of the us tax reform the yearoveryear decrease was largely due to a more favorable mix of earnings partially offset by loss provisions and the establishment of a valuation allowance on us state deferred taxes

as discussed in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements restricted cash relates to amounts escrowed related to certain payments to be made to former frutarom option holders in future periods at december 31 2019 we had a balance of 171 million compared to 136 million at december 31 2018  

cash flows from operating activities 

operating cash flows in 2019 were 6990 million compared to 4376 million in 2018 and 3908 million in 2017  the increase in operating cash flows from 2018 to 2019 was principally driven by higher earnings from inclusion of our frutarom acquisition and lower net working capital principally related to accounts receivable  the increase in operating cash flows from 2017 to 2018 was principally driven by lower litigation settlement and pension payments and higher net income offset by higher net working capital principally related to inventories 

working capital current assets less current liabilities totaled 139 billion at yearend 2019 compared to 181 billion at december 31 2018  this decrease in working capital of 4232 million primarily reflected decreases in accounts receivable and increases in accounts payable current portion of longterm debt and other current liabilities offset by increases in inventories prepaid expenses and other current assets as compared to the prior year 

we entered into certain factoring agreements in the us and the netherlands under which we can factor up to approximately 100 million in receivables the new factoring agreements supplement our existing factoring programs that are sponsored by certain customers under all of the arrangements we sell the receivables on a nonrecourse basis to unrelated financial institutions and account for the transactions as a sale of receivables the applicable receivables are removed from our consolidated balance sheet when the cash proceeds are received by us as of december 31 2019  2018 and 2017  we had sold receivables pursuant to these factoring programs of approximately 2057 million  1683 million and 1601 million  respectively participation in the various programs increased cash provided by operations by approximately 377 million  136 million and 150 million in 2019  2018 and 2017 respectively the cost of participating in these programs was approximately 71 million  34 million  and 30 million in 2019  2018  and 2017  respectively 

cash flows used in investing activities 

net investing activities in 2019 utilized 2259 million compared to 50132 million and 2999 million in 2018 and 2017  respectively the decrease in cash paid for investing activities was primarily driven by higher payments for acquisitions in the prior year in 2019 we acquired certain companies as described in note 3 for approximately 491 million  net of cash acquired in 2018 we acquired frutarom for approximately 7 billion net of cash acquired of which 49 billion was paid in cash 

additions to property plant and equipment were 2360 million  1701 million and 1290 million in 2019  2018 and 2017  respectively net of grants and other reimbursements from government authorities these investments largely arise from our ongoing focus to align our manufacturing facilities with customer demand primarily in emerging markets and new technology consistent with our strategy 

the decrease in cash used in investing activities from 2019 compared to 2018 primarily driven by the items above were partially offset by proceeds from the disposal of assets and proceeds from the termination of existing cross currency swap instruments during the current year 

in light of our requirement to relocate one of our fragrance ingredients facilities in china the ongoing construction of new facilities in india and indonesia and capital requirements to integrate our recently acquired frutarom business we expect that capital spending in 2020 will be about 4 5 of sales net of potential grants and other reimbursements from government authorities 

frutarom integration initiative 

we expect to incur costs related to the frutarom integration initiative integration projects are primarily focused on driving cost synergies in the manufacturing and creative networks procurement and overhead functions restructuring costs associated with these initiatives are expected to include employeerelated cash costs including severance retirement and other termination benefits fixed asset writedowns and contract termination and other costs in addition other costs associated with the frutarom integration initiative are expected to include advisory and personnel costs for managing and implementing integration projects 

total restructuring costs for the program are expected to be approximately 65 million including cash and noncash items during 2019  we incurred 104 million in costs related to the closure of 10 sites we expect to close approximately 35 manufacturing sites over the next two years with most of the closures targeted to occur before the end of fiscal 2020 the costs principally related to severance and fixed asset writedowns with the remainder comprising costs such as contract termination and relocation 

additionally during 2019  we recorded 552 million in advisory services retention bonuses and performance stock awards costs related to the integration of the frutarom acquisition 

we expect to achieve 145 million of synergy targets and have realized approximately 50 million of cost synergies in 2019 

cash flows used in financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities in 2019 was 5051 million  compared to cash provided by financing activities of 48707 million in 2018 and cash used in financing activities of 426 million in 2017  respectively the decrease in 2019 versus 2018 was principally driven by frutarom related financing activities in 2018 partially offset by higher dividend payments in the current year 

the increase in 2018 versus 2017 was principally driven by frutarom related financing activities where we issued 33 billion of debt including €11 billion aggregate principal amount of the 2018 euro senior notes 15 billion aggregate principal amount of the 2018 usd senior notes 1395 million aggregate principal amount of the amortizing note portion of the teus and 350 million aggregate principal amount of the term loan as compared to 4939 million of 2047 notes issued in 2017 we also issued 23 billion of equity in the third quarter of 2018 to finance the frutarom acquisition including 16 billion of our common stock and 6855 million of the stock purchase contract portion spc of the teus additionally in 2018 we repaid 2888 million of our senior notes  2007 including the loss on extinguishment of debt of 388 million 

at december 31 2019  we had 43824 million of debt outstanding compared to 45531 million outstanding at december 31 2018  

we paid dividends totaling 3135 million  2302 million and 2061 million in 2019  2018 and 2017  respectively the cash dividend declared per share in 2019  2018 and 2017 was 296  284 and 266  respectively 

our capital allocation strategy is primarily focused on debt repayment to maintain our investment grade rating we will also prioritize capital investment in our businesses to support the strategic long term plans we are also committed to maintaining our history of paying a dividend to investors determined by our board of directors at its discretion based on various factors 

in december 2012 the board of directors authorized a 2500 million share repurchase program which commenced in the first quarter of 2013 in august 2015 the board of directors approved an additional 2500 million share repurchase authorization and extension through december 31 2017 based on the total remaining amount of 561 million available under the amended repurchase program as of october 31 2017 the board of directors reapproved on november 1 2017 a 2500 million share repurchase authorization and extension for a total value of 3000 million available under the program which expires on november 1 2022  based on the total remaining amount of 2797 million available under the repurchase program approximately 22 million shares or 20 of shares outstanding based on the market price and shares outstanding as of december 31 2019  could be repurchased under the program as of december 31 2019  as of may 7 2018 we have suspended our share repurchases 

capital resources 

operating cash flow provides the primary source of funds for capital investment needs dividends paid to shareholders and debt service repayments we anticipate that cash flows from operations and availability under our existing credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our investing and financing needs we regularly assess our capital structure including both current and longterm debt instruments as compared to our cash generation and investment needs in order to provide ample flexibility and to optimize our leverage ratios we believe our existing cash balances are sufficient to meet our debt service requirements

on june 6 2018 and amended on july 13 2018 we entered into a term loan credit agreement to replace a portion of the bridge loan facility reducing the amount of the bridge loan commitments by 350 million  under the term loan credit agreement the lenders thereunder committed to provide subject to certain conditions a senior unsecured term loan facility as amended term loan in an original aggregate principal amount of up to 3500 million  maturing three years after the funding date thereunder the proceeds from the term loan were received on october 3 2018 

the term loan bears interest at our option at a per annum rate equal to either x an adjusted libor rate plus an applicable margin varying from 075 to 200 or y a base rate plus an applicable margin varying from 000 to 100  in each case depending on the public debt ratings for noncredit enhanced longterm senior unsecured debt issued by us loans under the term loan will amortize quarterly at a per annum rate of 100 of the aggregate principal amount of the loans made under the term loan on the funding date commencing december 31 2018 with the balance payable on october 3 2021 we may voluntarily prepay the term loans without premium or penalty 

during the year ended december 31 2019 we made payments of 110 million on the term loan 

the credit facility and term loan contain various covenants limitations and events of default customary for similar facilities for similarly rated borrowers including the requirement for us to maintain at the end of each fiscal quarter a ratio of net debt for borrowed money to adjusted ebitda in respect of the previous 12month period including the pro forma effect of the acquisition of frutarom of not more than 45 to 10 which shall be reduced to 425 to 10 as of the end of september 30 2019 40 to 10 as of the end of march 31 2020 and to 35 to 10 as of the end of march 31 2021

brazil tax credits 

in 2017 the brazilian supreme court “bsc” ruled that brazilian tax authorities should not include a value added tax known as icms in the calculation of certain indirect taxes piscofins by removing the icms from the calculation of the indirect tax base the court effectively eliminated a “tax on tax” the brazilian tax authorities filed an appeal seeking clarification of certain matters including the amount of icms to which taxpayers would be entitled in order to reduce their indirect tax base ie the gross rate or the net rate 

in light of the bscs decision in november 2017 we filed suit consistent with the bsc decision to require that icms be excluded from the piscofins calculation and received a favorable preliminary decision that was confirmed by the bsc in september 2018 this preliminary ruling granted us the right to prospectively exclude icms amounts from the piscofins calculation but left open the issue of whether the company could recover the gross or net amount of icms amounts paid on piscofins for the period from november 2011 to december 2018 

in early january 2020 we were informed that a favorable decision was reached confirming that we were entitled to recover the icms overpayments on piscofins for the period from november 2011 to december 2018 plus interest on that amount the ruling did not however settle the question of whether the company is eligible to recover based on the gross or the net amount of icms amounts paid on piscofins a final ruling on the gross versus net amount issued is expected to be rendered in mid2020 

based on currently available information the company recognized 80 million as a recovery in the fourth quarter of 2019 as a component of selling and administrative expenses additional amounts may be recorded in 2020 upon completion of the final claim and subject to the satisfactory outcome of the final ruling on the use of the gross method of calculation 

other commitments 

compliance with existing governmental requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment has not materially affected our operations earnings or competitive position in 2019 and 2018  we spent 45 million and 62 million on capital projects and 260 million and 217 million respectively in operating expenses and governmental charges for the purpose of complying with such regulations expenditures for these purposes will continue for the foreseeable future in addition we are party to a number of proceedings brought under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act or similar state statutes it is expected that the impact of any judgments in or voluntary settlements of such proceedings will not be material to our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

contractual obligations 

at december 31 2019  we had contractual payment obligations due within the time periods as specified in the following table   



 

 the table above does not include 683 million of the total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions and approximately 14 million of associated accrued interest and 461 million associated with the deferred tax liability on deemed repatriation due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential cash flows we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the amount and period in which the remaining liabilities might be paid 

critical accounting policies and use of estimates 

our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements as disclosed in note 1  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and accompanying disclosures these estimates are based on management’s best judgment of current events and actions that we may undertake in the future actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates 

those areas requiring the greatest degree of management judgment or deemed most critical to our financial reporting involve 

business combinations from time to time we enter into strategic acquisitions in an effort to better service existing customers and to attain new customers when we acquire a controlling financial interest in an entity or group of assets that are determined to meet the definition of a business we apply the acquisition method described in asc topic 805 business combinations in accordance with gaap the results of the acquisitions we have completed are reflected in our financial statements from the date of acquisition forward 

we allocate the purchase consideration paid to acquire the business to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values at the acquisition date with the excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill if during the measurement period a period not to exceed twelve months from the acquisition date we receive additional information that existed as of the acquisition date but at the time of the original allocation described above was unknown to us we make the appropriate adjustments to the purchase price allocation in the reporting period in which the amounts are determined 

significant judgment is required to estimate the intangibles and fair value of fixed assets and in assigning their respective useful lives accordingly we typically engage thirdparty valuation specialists who work under the direction of management to assist in valuing significant tangible and intangible assets acquired 

the fair value estimates are based on available historical information future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management but are inherently uncertain 

we typically use an income method to estimate the fair value of intangible assets which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants and include the amount and timing of future cash flows including expected growth rates discount rate and profitability royalty rates used in the relief of royalty method customer attrition rates product obsolescence factors a brand’s relative market position and the discount rate applied to the cash flows unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions 

determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires significant judgment all of our acquired intangible assets eg trademarks product formulas noncompete agreements and customer relationships are expected to have finite useful lives our estimates of the useful lives of finitelived intangible assets are based on a number of factors including competitive environment market share brand history operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the regions in which the brands are sold 

the costs of finitelived intangible assets are amortized through expense over their estimated lives the value of residual goodwill is not amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment as described in the following note for acquired intangible assets the remaining useful life of the trade names and trademarks product formulas and customer relationships was estimated at the point at which substantially all of the present value of cumulative cash flows have been earned 

the periodic assessment of potential impairment of goodwill we currently have goodwill of 55 billion  of which 43 billion relates to our acquisition of frutarom we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level as of november 30 every year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a component to which goodwill is assigned when initially recorded 

we identify our reporting units by assessing whether the components of our operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and management of each operating segment regularly reviews the operating results of those components we have identified nine reporting units under the taste scent and frutarom segments 1 flavor compounds 2 fragrance compounds 3 fragrance ingredients 4 cosmetic actives ingredients collectively the iff legacy reporting units 5 taste 6 savory 7 natural product solutions 8 frutarom fragrance and fine ingredients and 9 inclusions collectively the frutarom reporting units 

when testing goodwill for impairment we have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount if we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting units or if a qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not that the estimated carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value we perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test 

under the quantitative goodwill impairment test if a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value we will record an impairment charge based on that difference and the impairment charge will be limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit 

these factors may affect individual reporting units disproportionately relative to the company as a whole as a result the performance of one or more of the reporting units could decline resulting in an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets 

for the annual impairment test performed as of november 30 2019  we did not utilize the optional qualitative test and performed an annual goodwill impairment test for all nine of our reporting units by performing the quantitative test 

determining the fair value of our reporting units for goodwill requires significant estimates and judgments by management we assessed the fair value of the reporting units using an income approach under the income approach we determine the fair value by using a discounted cash flow method at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows projecting future cash flows of each reporting unit as well as a terminal value we use the most current actual and forecasted operating data available and key estimates and assumptions used in these valuations include revenue growth rates and profit margins based on our internal forecasts our relevant weightedaverage cost of capital used to discount future cash flows market assumptions and our historical operating trends 

in order to further validate the reasonableness of the estimated fair values of the reporting units as of the valuation date a reconciliation of the aggregate fair values of all reporting units to market capitalization was performed using a reasonable control premium 

there was no impairment of goodwill at any one of our nine reporting units in 2019  based on the annual impairment test performed at november 30 2019 we determined that iff legacy reporting units fair values exceeded their respective carrying values by over 200 with the exception of one reporting unit that had 80 excess fair value over carrying value in the analysis performed for the frutarom reporting units there was less than 10 excess fair value over carrying value for two reporting units the fair values of the remaining frutarom reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values by a range of approximately 10 to 55 

for the reporting units with less than 10 excess fair value the savory reporting unit had excess fair value over carrying value of 83 and the taste reporting unit had excess fair value over carrying value of 75  while management believes that the assumptions used in the impairment test were reasonable changes in key assumptions including lower revenue growth lower operating margin lower terminal growth rates or increasing discount rates could result in a future impairment 

if current longterm projections for these reporting units are not realized or materially decrease we may be required to writeoff all or a portion of the goodwill such charge could have a material effect on the consolidated statements of operations and balance sheets 

using the income approach and holding other assumptions constant the following table provides the impact on the headroom by hypothetically changing key assumptions on a standalone basis for the companys savory and taste reporting units as of november 30 2019 



the periodic assessment of potential impairment of longlived assets we review longlived assets for impairment when events or changes in business conditions indicate that their full carrying value may not be recovered an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by an asset or group of assets is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists if assets are determined to be impaired the loss is measured based on an estimate of fair value using various valuation techniques including a discounted estimate of future cash flows 

the analysis and evaluation of income taxes we account for taxes under the asset and liability method under this method deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax return bases of assets and liabilities a valuation allowance is recognized if based on the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized the assessment of the need for a valuation allowance requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future earnings reversal of existing temporary differences and available tax planning strategies if actual experience differs from these estimates and assumptions the recorded deferred tax asset may not be fully realized resulting in an increase to income tax expense in our results of operations 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes we first determine whether it is “more likely than not” that we would sustain our tax position if the relevant tax authority were to audit the position with full knowledge of all the relevant facts and other information for those tax positions that meet this threshold we measure the amount of tax benefit based on the largest amount of tax benefit that we have a greater than 50 chance of realizing in a final settlement with the relevant authority those tax positions failing to qualify for initial recognition are recognized in the first interim period in which they meet the more likely than not standard this evaluation is made at the time that we adopt a tax position and whenever there is new information and is based upon management’s evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date we maintain a cumulative risk portfolio relating to all of our uncertainties in income taxes in order to perform this analysis but the evaluation of our tax positions requires significant judgment and estimation in part because in certain cases tax law is subject to varied interpretation and whether a tax position will ultimately be sustained may be uncertain we do not currently believe that any of our pending tax assessments even if ultimately resolved against us would have a material impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

determination of the various assumptions employed in the valuation of pension and retiree health care expense and associated obligations amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined from actuarial valuations inherent in such valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets discount rates at which the liabilities could be settled rates of increase in future compensation levels mortality rates and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore affect expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods 

we consider a number of factors in determining and selecting assumptions for the overall expected longterm rate of return on plan assets we consider the historical longterm return experience of our assets the current and expected allocation of our plan assets and expected longterm rates of return we derive these expected longterm rates of return with the assistance of our investment advisors we base our expected allocation of plan assets on a diversified portfolio consisting of domestic and international equity securities fixed income real estate and alternative asset classes 

we consider a variety of factors in determining and selecting our assumptions for the discount rate at december 31 for the us plans the discount rate was based on the internal rate of return for a portfolio of high quality bonds rated aa or higher by either moody’s or standard  poors with maturities that are consistent with the projected future benefit payment obligations of the plan for the nonus plans the discount rates were determined by region and are based on high quality longterm corporate bonds consideration has been given to the duration of the liabilities in each plan when selecting the bonds 

to be used in determining the discount rate the rate of compensation increase for all plans and the medical cost trend rate for the applicable us plans are based on plan experience 

with respect to the us plans the expected rate of return on plan assets was determined based on an asset allocation model using the current target allocation real rates of return by asset class and an anticipated inflation rate the target asset allocation consists of approximately 20 in equity securities and 80 in fixed income securities the plan has achieved a compounded annual rate of return of 50 over the previous 20 years at december 31 2019  the actual asset allocation for the us plan was 1 cash and cash equivalents 13 in equity securities and 86 in fixed income securities 

the expected rate of return for the nonus plans employs a similar set of criteria adapted for local investments inflation rates and in certain cases specific government requirements the target asset allocation for the nonus plans consists of approximately 35 in fixed income securities 35 in alternative investments 15 in equity securities and 15 in real estate at december 31 2019  the actual asset allocation for the nonus plan was 37 in fixed income investments 14 in equity investments 8 in real estate investments 1 in cash and cash equivalents and 40 in alternative investments 

changes in pension and associated expenses may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions the impact that a 025 decrease in the discount rate or longterm rate of return would have on our pension expense is as follows 



the ongoing assessment of the valuation of inventory given the large number of natural ingredients employed the quality of which may be diminished over time we hold a majority of our inventory as raw materials providing the greatest degree of flexibility in manufacture and use as of december 31 2019  we maintained 50 of our inventory as raw materials materials are evaluated based on shelf life known uses and anticipated demand based on forecasted customer order activity and changes in productsales mix management policy provides for an ongoing assessment of inventory with adjustments recorded when an item is deemed to be slow moving or obsolete 

accounting for redeemable noncontrolling interest the noncontrolling interests that are reflected as redeemable noncontrolling interests in our consolidated financial statements consist of those owners including us who have certain redemption rights whether currently exercisable or not and which currently or in the future require that we purchase or the owner sell the noncontrolling interest held by the owner if certain conditions are met and the owners request the purchase we also have a call right which could be exercised when such conditions are met we assumed these interests through some of our subsidiaries such noncontrolling interests are reported in the consolidated balance sheet between liabilities and equity as redeemable noncontrolling interest we adjust the redeemable noncontrolling interests when the redemption value exceeds the carrying value with changes recognized as an adjustment to additional paidin capital accounting for redeemable noncontrolling interest involve judgment and complexity specifically on the classification of the noncontrolling interest in our consolidated balance sheet further there is significant judgment involved in determining whether an equity instrument is currently redeemable or not currently redeemable but probable that the equity instrument will become redeemable estimating the redemption value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests requires the use of significant assumptions and estimates changes in these assumptions and estimates can have a significant impact on the calculation of the redemption value 

overall we believe that we have considered relevant circumstances that we may be currently subject to and the financial statements accurately reflect our best estimate of the impact of these items in our results of operations financial condition and cash flows for the years presented we have discussed the decision process and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we operate on a global basis and are exposed to currency fluctuation related to the manufacture and sale of our products in currencies other than the us dollar the major foreign currencies involve the markets in the european union great britain mexico brazil china india indonesia australia russia and japan although all regions are subject to foreign currency fluctuations versus the us dollar we actively monitor our foreign currency exposures in all major markets in which we operate and employ a variety of techniques to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations including foreign currency hedging activities 

we have established a centralized reporting system to evaluate the effects of changes in interest rates currency exchange rates and other relevant market risks our risk management procedures include the monitoring of interest rate and foreign exchange exposures and hedge positions utilizing statistical analyses of cash flows market value and sensitivity analysis however the use of these techniques to quantify the market risk of such instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of their accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions for the year ended december 31 2019  our exposure to market risk was estimated using sensitivity analyses which illustrate the change in the fair value of a derivative financial instrument assuming hypothetical changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts with the objective of reducing exposure to cash flow volatility associated with foreign currency receivables and payables and with anticipated purchases of certain raw materials used in operations these contracts the counterparties to which are major international financial institutions generally involve the exchange of one currency for a second currency at a future date and have maturities not exceeding twelve months the gain or loss on the hedging instrument and services is recorded in earnings at the same time as the transaction being hedged is recorded in earnings at december 31 2019  our foreign currency exposures pertaining to derivative contracts exist with the euro japanese yen british pound australian dollar and indonesian rupiah based on a hypothetical decrease or increase of 10 in the applicable balance sheet exchange rates primarily against the us dollar the estimated fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts would increase by approximately 10 million however any change in the value of the contracts real or hypothetical would be significantly offset by a corresponding change in the value of the underlying hedged items 

we use derivative instruments as part of our interest rate risk management strategy we have entered into certain cross currency swap agreements in order to mitigate a portion of our net european investments from foreign currency risk as of december 31 2018 these swaps were in a net liability position with an aggregate fair value of 42 million  based on a hypothetical decrease or increase of 10 in the value of the us dollar against the euro the estimated fair value of our cross currency swaps would change by approximately 60 million 

at december 31 2019  the fair value of our eur fixed rate debt was €19 billion  based on a hypothetical decrease or increase of 10 in foreign exchange rates the estimated fair value of our eur fixed debt would change by approximately 200 million 

at december 31 2019  the fair value of our usd fixed rate debt was 25 billion  based on a hypothetical decrease or increase of 10 in interest rates the estimated fair value of our us fixed debt would change by approximately 250 million 

we purchase certain commodities such as natural gas electricity petroleum based products and certain crop related items we generally purchase these commodities based upon market prices that are established with the vendor as part of the purchase process in general we do not use commodity financial instruments to hedge commodity prices

business

we are a leading innovator of sensory experiences that move the world we cocreate unique products that consumers taste smell or touch our expanded geographical footprint and product portfolio position us to better serve both our global customers and the growing regional midsized and smaller specialty customers 

 through the acquisition of frutarom we increased our product portfolio with complementary adjacencies such as natural colors antioxidants for food preservation nutraceuticals ingredients for infant formula and proteins for elderly nutrition and expanded core product lines with savory solutions aimed at the meat and fish industry citrus and other naturals flavors specialty ingredients and new cosmetic actives as a result we now have over 90000  products within our portfolio that are provided to customers in approximately 195  countries which includes a significant number of fastergrowing small and midsized customers 

prior to our acquisition of frutarom we had 37  manufacturing facilities and 21  creative centers and application laboratories located in 35  different countries upon our acquisition of frutarom we acquired 60  additional manufacturing facilities and 84  additional rdapplication laboratories globally including many of the countries in which we currently operate we currently anticipate that over time we will optimize our global facilities footprint as we continue to seek opportunities to efficiently and costeffectively deliver value to our global customers 

the 2018 combined sales of iff and frutarom which combines the full year 2018 sales of both frutarom and iff was approximately 51 billion  which management believes makes us the second largest company in the taste scent and nutrition industry we expect that our combined cultures of innovation and partnership will allow us to further capitalize on this expansion to continue to offer our customers innovative and differentiated products 

 during the past few years through acquisitions and the development of tastepoint we have leveraged our expertise to expand our north american midsized customer base with the acquisition of frutarom which was principally focused on serving small and midsized companies globally we have significantly increased our exposure to these fastergrowing customers based on our 2018 combined sales approximately 35  of our customers are global consumer products companies while approximately 65  of our customers are small and midsized companies 

during 2018 our 25 largest customers accounted for 47  of our sales however as a result of the effect of the frutarom acquisition our 25 largest customers only accounted for 37  of our 2018 combined sales similarly while sales to our largest customer across all enduse categories which principally arose from our scent business accounted for 9 to 12   of our sales for each of the last three fiscal years sales to this customer only accounted for 7  of our 2018 combined sales 

our business is geographically diverse with sales in the us representing approximately 25  of sales in 2018 and no other geographic market representing more than 6  of sales we believe that more significant future growth potential for the flavors and fragrances industry and for our business exists in the emerging markets which we classify as all markets except north america japan australia and western southern and northern europe as a result we intend to continue to build on our multidecade experience in the emerging markets during 2018 sales in emerging markets represented 48  of our 2018 sales as our customers seek to grow their businesses in emerging markets we provide them the ability to leverage our longstanding international presence and extensive market knowledge to help drive their brands in these markets 

we operate in three business segments taste previously flavors scent previously fragrances and commencing upon its acquisition frutarom in 2018 our taste business represented 44  of our sales our scent business represented 47  of sales and frutarom represented 9  of sales based on our 2018 combined sales our taste business represented 34  of sales

our scent business represented 36  of sales and frutarom represented 30  of sales 

for financial information about our reportable operating segments and the geographic areas in which we do business please see note 15  of our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

vision 2020 strategy 

we believe that 2018 was a transformative year as our continued internal growth and our acquisition of frutarom has delivered successes against all four pillars of our vision 2020 strategy which has focused on building differentiation and accelerating growth to create shareholder value 

 our product offerings 

fragrances 

our fragrance business derives revenue from two sources fragrance compounds and ingredients we are a global leader in the creation of fragrance compounds that are integral elements in the world’s finest perfumes and bestknown consumer products within fabric care home care personal wash hair care and toiletries our fragrance ingredients business is a vertically integrated operation originating with the development in our research laboratories of naturals synthetic and proprietary molecules and innovative delivery systems progressing to our manufacturing facilities that produce these ingredients in a consistent highquality and costeffective manner and transitioning to our creative centers and application laboratories where our perfumers partner with our customers to create unique fragrance compounds for use in a variety of enduse products we also produce cosmetic active and functional ingredients for use in cosmetics 

by providing our fragrance development teams with an extensive portfolio of innovative highquality and effective ingredients to support their creativity we are able to provide our customers with a unique identity for their brands these ingredients or fragrance compounds can then be combined with our innovative delivery systems including our proprietary encapsulation technology which consists of individual fragrance droplets coated with a protective polymeric shell to deliver superior fragrance performance throughout a products lifecycle these delivery systems are key differentiators in the growth of our consumer fragrance compounds 

  4 

fragrance compounds  fragrance compounds are unique and proprietary combinations of multiple ingredients that are ultimately used by our customers in their consumer goods our creative and commercial teams within fragrance compounds are organized into two broad categories fine fragrances and consumer fragrances 

fine fragrances  fine fragrances focuses on perfumes and colognes iff’s scientists and perfumers collaborate to develop new molecules new natural extractions and innovative processes that enliven perfumers palettes and help them create unique inspiring fragrances we have created some of the industryleading fine fragrance classics as well as cuttingedge niche fragrances as evidenced by the number of top sellers 

consumer fragrances  our consumer fragrances include five enduse categories of products 

 ingredients   fragrance ingredients consists of active and functional ingredients that are used internally and sold to third parties including customers and competitors for use in preparation of compounds while the principal role of our fragrance ingredients facilities is to support our fragrance compounds business we utilize our excess manufacturing capacity to manufacture and sell certain fragrance ingredients to third parties we believe that this business allows us to leverage our fixed costs while maintaining the security of supply for our perfumers and ultimately our customers fragrance ingredients available for sale to third parties include innovative ingredients that leverage our manufacturing experience as well as a limited amount of costcompetitive commodity ingredients as our fragrance compounds business grows we expect that the percentage of capacity allocated to the production of fragrance ingredients for sale to third parties may decrease fragrance ingredients also includes our cosmetic active and functional ingredients which provide biologists and cosmetic chemists with innovative solutions to address cosmetic challenges such as skin aging and hair protection 

with approximately 1300  separate fragrance and active and functional ingredients plus additional botanicals and delivery systems we believe we are a leader in the industry with the breadth of our product portfolio 

consistent with our vision 2020 strategy our fragrance business continues to build upon our strengths to differentiate ourselves from our competitors address evolving consumer demands and deliver accelerated growth specifically we intend to focus on 

 flavors 

our flavors business is focused on building upon our strengths with flavors and focusing on addressing industry trends that will allow us to differentiate ourselves from our competitors and deliver accelerated growth consistent with our vision 

  5 

2020 strategy the trends driving these growth opportunities include 

continued consumer demand for fresh clean and authentic products  consumers are increasingly demanding that their food and beverage products contain natural and organic ingredients and possess dietary and nutritional value reduced fat salt sugar etc based on these demands natural food and beverage products are increasingly perceived by consumers as being of higher quality healthier and more environmentally friendly to ensure that they understand the quality of these products consumers nongovernmental organizations and governmental agencies are seeking more transparency in product labeling in response many of our customers are announcing initiatives to provide “clean label” products products that do not include any artificial ingredients we believe our vision 2020 strategy’s focus on innovation including our modulation technology delivery systems and our naturals and proprietary ingredients will help our customers address these changing consumer demands 

expansion of consumer food companies  the number of participants in the food industry continues to expand with midsized regional companies and companies focused on nicheproduct categories joining the traditional global companies to drive and accelerate product innovation consequently larger food and beverage companies are seeing slower growth than in previous years to be responsive to these developments we created tastepoint by iff representing the collaboration of ottens flavors and david michael which primarily services midsized customers in north america by providing the approach of a smaller company backed by expertise traditionally reserved for companies with a more global reach through our acquisition of frutarom we have added approximately 39000  small and midsized customers we intend to continue to look for innovative and valuecreating methods for serving this growing customer base 

flavors are the key building blocks that impart taste experiences in food and beverage products and as such play a significant role in determining consumer preference for the end products in which they are used as a leading creator of flavor compounds we help our customers deliver on the promise of delicious and healthy foods and drinks that appeal to consumers while we are a global leader our flavors business is more regional in nature with different formulas that reflect local taste preferences consequently we manage our flavors business geographically creating flavor compounds in our regional creative centers which allow us to satisfy local taste preferences while also helping to ensure regulatory compliance and production standards we develop thousands of different flavors and taste offerings for our customers most of which are tailormade we continually develop new formulas to meet changing consumer preferences and customer needs 

our flavor compounds are ultimately used by our customers in the following four enduse categories of consumer goods 

 our frutarom business creates and manufactures a naturalsfocused suite of flavor compounds and specialty fine ingredients largely targeting small local and regional customers our frutarom business seeks to capitalize on the health and wellness focus of consumers and deliver growth by offering customers natural flavor products that combine solutions to create natural colors and natural functional food ingredients which promote health benefits and extend shelf life based on this historical concentration the majority of frutaroms raw materials and products come from natural sources 

frutarom’s products are focused on three principal areas 



  6 

and personal care 

 research and product development process 

consumer insights 

we believe that the first step to creating an innovative and unique flavor or fragrance experience begins with gaining insight into the consumer by developing a deep understanding of what consumers value and prefer we are better able to focus our rd and creative efforts 

our consumer insight and marketing teams interpret trends monitor product launches analyze quantitative market data and conduct numerous consumer interviews annually our sensory experts direct research programs exploring topics such as fragrance performance the psychophysics of sensory perception including chemesthetic properties such as warming cooling and tingling the genetic basis for flavor and fragrance preference and the effects of aromas on mood performance health and wellbeing 

based on this information we develop innovative programs to evaluate potential products that enable us to understand the emotional connections between a prospective product and the consumer we believe this ability to pinpoint the likelihood of a product’s success translates into stronger brand equity resulting in increased returns and greater market share gains for our customers as well as iff 

research and development 

we consider our rd infrastructure to be one of our key competencies and we focus and invest substantial resources in the research and development of new and innovative molecules compounds formulas and technologies and the application of these to our customers’ products we spend approximately 8  of our sales on the research development and implementation of new molecules compounds and technologies that help our customers respond to changing consumer preferences using the knowledge gained from our consumer insights program we strategically focus our resources around key rd platforms that address consumer needs or preferences or anticipate future preferences by aligning our resources around these platforms we ensure the proper support and focus for each program so that it can be further developed and eventually accepted for commercial application 

we currently have 392  patents in the united states including those we have acquired from frutarom and our other transactions in addition we have developed many unique molecules and delivery systems for our customers that are used as the foundations of successful flavors and fragrances around the world 

we have traditionally conducted our principal rd activities in union beach new jersey where we employ scientists and application engineers who collaborate with our other rd centers around the world to support the 



  7 

as of december 31 2018  we employed about 2300  people globally in rd activities including 568  in our recently acquired frutarom business we spent 3116 million  2955 million  and 2589 million  or approximately 78  87  and 83  of sales in 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively on rd activities while we have historically spent approximately 8 of sales on rd activities based on the significantly increased sales resulting from the frutarom acquisition we expect that that percentage will decrease during 2019 

our ingredients research program discovers molecules found in natural substances and creates new molecules that are subsequently tested for their sensorial value to broaden our offerings of natural innovative and unique products we seek collaborations with research institutions and other companies throughout the world we have established a number of such collaborations to strengthen our innovation pipeline we may also consider acquiring companies that could provide access to new technologies consistent with our vision 2020 strategy 

the development of new and customized flavor and fragrance compounds is a complex process calling upon the combined knowledge of our scientists flavorists and perfumers scientists from various disciplines work in project teams with flavorists and perfumers to develop flavor and fragrance compounds with consumer preferred performance characteristics the development of new flavor and fragrance compounds requires i an indepth knowledge of the flavor and fragrance characteristics of the various ingredients we use ii an understanding of how the many ingredients in a consumer product interact and iii the creation of controlled release and delivery systems to enhance flavor and fragrance performance to facilitate this process we have a scientific advisory board that provides external perspectives and independent feedback on our rd and sustainability initiatives 

in 2017 we launched reimagine a multitiered program to accelerate innovation and increase agility to capture unmet opportunities in the changing food and beverage market based on a combination of future trends analysis consumer insights and a modernized crosscategory development process the program guides our research and development efforts to ensure an innovation pipeline that addresses evolving consumer needs and desires 

creative application 

we also have a network of 21  creative centers and application laboratories including 84  acquired in the frutarom transaction around the world where we create or adapt the basic flavors or fragrances compounds that we have developed in the rd process to commercialize for use in our customers’ consumer products our global creative teams consist of perfumers fragrance evaluators and flavorists as well as marketing consumer insights and technical application experts from a wide range of cultures and nationalities in close partnership with our customers’ product development groups our creative teams create the sensory experiences that our customers are seeking in order to satisfy consumer demands in each of their markets 

development of new flavors and fragrances is driven by a variety of sources including requests from our customers who are in need of a specific flavors and fragrances for use in a new or modified consumer product or as a result of internal initiatives stemming from our consumer insights program our product development team works in partnership with our scientists and researchers to optimize the consumer appeal of the flavors and fragrances a collaborative process between our researchers our product development team and our customers then follows to perfect the flavors and fragrances so that it is ready to be included in the final consumer product 

in addition to creating new flavors and fragrances our researchers and product development teams advise customers on ways to improve their existing products by adjusting or substituting current ingredients with more readily accessible or less expensive materials or by modifying the current ingredients to produce an enhanced yield this often results in creating a better value proposition for our customers 

our flavors and fragrances compound formulas are treated as trade secrets and remain our proprietary asset our business is not materially dependent upon any individual patent trademark or license 

supply chain 

we strive to provide our customers with consistent quality products on a timely and costeffective basis by managing all aspects of the supply chain from raw material sourcing through manufacturing quality assurance regulatory compliance and distribution 

procurement 

in connection with the manufacture of compounds we use natural ingredients and primarily in our fragrance compounds synthetic ingredients we purchase approximately 21000  different raw materials from about 6000  domestic and international suppliers and distributors 

  8 

the vast majority of frutaroms raw materials and products come from natural sources with the acquisition of frutarom we significantly increased our natural products and therefore we expect that the percentage of our ingredients that are natural or croprelated has increased natural ingredients are derived from flowers fruits and other botanical products as well as from animal products they contain varying numbers of organic chemicals that are responsible for the fragrance or flavor of the natural product natural products are purchased in processed or semiprocessed form some are used in compounds in the state in which they are purchased and others are used after further processing natural products together with various chemicals are also used as raw materials for the manufacture of synthetic ingredients by chemical processes our flavor products also include extracts and seasonings derived from various fruits vegetables nuts herbs and spices as well as microbiologicallyderived ingredients 

in order to ensure our supply of raw materials achieve favorable pricing and provide timely transparency regarding inflationary trends to our customers we continue to be focused on i implementing a forwardbuy strategy ii entering into supplier relationships to gain access to supplies that we do not have iii implementing indexed pricing iv reducing the complexity of our formulations and v evaluating whether it is more profitable to buy or make an ingredient we are also concentrating on local country sourcing with our own procurement professionals 

manufacturing and distribution 

prior to our acquisition of frutarom we had 37  manufacturing facilities and 21  creative centers and application laboratories located in 35  different countries our major manufacturing facilities have been located in the united states the netherlands spain great britain indonesia turkey brazil mexico china india and singapore based on the regional nature of the taste business and the concerns regarding the fragile nature of transporting raw materials we have typically established smaller manufacturing facilities in our local markets that are focused on local needs products within the scent business are typically composed of compounds that are more stable and more transportable around the world consequently we have fewer manufacturing facilities within our scent business which produce compounds and ingredients for global distribution 

as part of our acquisition of frutarom we acquired their 60  manufacturing facilities in addition we 

acquired 84  additional creative centers and application laboratories globally including many of the countries in 

which we currently operate we currently anticipate that over time we will optimize our global facilities footprint 

to efficiently and costeffectively deliver value to our global customers 

our supply chain initiatives in developing markets are focused on increasing capacity and investments in key technologies within our more mature markets we tend to focus on consolidation and cost optimization as well as implementing new technologies in addition to our own manufacturing facilities we develop relationships with third parties including contract manufacturing organizations that permit us to expand access to the technologies capabilities and capacity that we need to better serve our customers 

in 2018 we continued to invest in our facilities we opened two new facilities in china a flavors manufacturing facility in the zhangjiagang free trade zone and a natural product research lab located in the nanjing life science park and broke ground on a new flavors and fragrances plant in india 

sustainability 

over the past several years we have redefined the way we envision sustainability moving from the traditional “takemakedispose” model we have embraced the circular economy model  one that is restorative and regenerative by design which we believe is key in safeguarding the wellbeing of our consumers the health of our planet and the integrity of our business 

our sustainability strategy is centered on three main platforms positive principles regenerative products and sensational people and is a key enabler of our overall vision 2020 business strategy 

 in 2018 iff was named to barron’s 100 most sustainable companies the ftse4good index series and the euronext vigeo world 120 additional achievements included

we develop produce and market our products in a number of jurisdictions throughout the world and are subject to federal regional and local legislation and regulations in each of the various countries our flavor and many of our fragrance products are intended for the food beverage and pharmaceutical industries which are subject to strict quality and regulatory standards as a result we are required to meet these strict standards which in recent years have become increasingly stringent 

our products and operations are subject to regulation by governmental agencies in each of the markets in which we operate these agencies include 1 the food and drug administration and equivalent international agencies that regulate flavors and other ingredients in consumer products 2 the environmental protection agency and equivalent international agencies that regulate our manufacturing facilities 3 the occupational safety and health administration and equivalent international agencies that regulate the working conditions in our manufacturing research laboratories and creative centers 4 local and international agencies that regulate trade and customs 5 the drug enforcement administration and other local or international agencies that regulate controlled chemicals that we use in our operations and 6 the chemical registrationnotification authorities that regulate chemicals that we use in or transport to the various countries in which we manufacture andor market our products we have seen an increase in registration and reporting requirements concerning the use of certain chemicals in a number of countries such as registration evaluation authorisation and restriction of chemicals reach regulations in the european union 

in addition we are subject to various rules relating to health work safety and the environment at the local and international levels in the various countries in which we operate our manufacturing facilities throughout the world are subject to environmental standards relating to air emissions sewage discharges the use of hazardous materials waste disposal practices and cleanup of existing environmental contamination in recent years there has been a significant increase in the stringency of environmental regulation and enforcement of environmental standards and the costs of compliance have risen significantly a trend we expect will continue in the future 

competition 

the markets for flavors fragrances and specialty ingredients are part of a larger market that supplies a wide variety of ingredients and compounds used in consumer products the broader market includes functional foods and food additives including seasonings texturizers spices enzymes certain foodrelated commodities and fortified products as well as nutritional ingredients and supplements and active cosmetic ingredients 

the global market for flavors and fragrances has expanded consistently primarily as a result of an increase in demand for and an increase in the variety of consumer products containing flavors and fragrances 

the market for flavors and fragrances is highly competitive based on annual sales our main competitors consist of 1 the three other large global flavor and fragrance manufacturers givaudan firmenich and symrise 2 midsized companies 3 numerous local and regional manufacturers and 4 consumer product companies who may develop their own flavors or fragrances 

we believe that our ability to compete successfully in the flavors and fragrances submarket is based on 



  10 

activities 

 large multinational customers and increasingly midsized customers may limit the number of their suppliers by placing some on “core lists” giving them priority for development and production of their new or modified products 

to compete more successfully in this environment we must make continued investments in customer relationships and tailor our research and development efforts to anticipate customers’ needs provide effective service and secure and maintain inclusion on certain “core lists” 

private label manufacturers mostly mediumsized local or small food manufacturers constitute a growing segment in the flavor market over the last decade with the strengthening of supermarket chains and growing consumer price consciousness demand and consumption of private label products has grown at a faster rate than the brand food industry rate we believe that new business opportunities will continue to arise from these clients as they are increasing demanding products that are similar to existing products in the market distinctive premium products as well as more innovative products 

the global demand for functional foods food additives nutritional ingredients and supplements and active cosmetic ingredients is also increasing with our recent acquisitions we have expanded our offerings to include products with the functional food ingredient market including ingredients focused on improving the health and wellness characteristics of a consumer good the nutritional supplement market and the cosmetic actives markets while the three other large global flavor and fragrance manufacturers givaudan firmenich and symrise are growing their business in these areas we also compete with specialty chemical companies other large multinational companies and smaller regional and local participants that offer products that address these same needs 

employee relations 

at december 31 2018  we had approximately 13000  employees worldwide of whom approximately 2100  are employed in the united states we believe that relations with our employees are good

risk factors 

tableend

we routinely encounter and address risks in conducting our business some of these risks may cause our future results to be different  sometimes materially different  than we presently anticipate below are material risks we have identified that could adversely affect our business how we react to material future developments as well as how our competitors and customers react to those developments could also affect our future results 

we may not realize the benefits anticipated from the frutarom acquisition which could adversely affect our business 

part of our growth strategy has included growth through acquisitions within the fragrance flavors natural ingredient industries and adjacencies the frutarom acquisition was our most significant acquisition and brings a significantly different customer base and new adjacent product categories to our business our expectations about the benefits of this acquisition are based on projections and assumptions about our combined businesses which depend on i our ability to maintain the current frutarom business ii our ability to achieve the anticipated synergies and iii our ability to crosssell the combined company’s products we may encounter significant challenges achieving these anticipated benefits including the following 



  13 

in addition our anticipated benefits of the acquisition of frutarom contemplate significant costsaving synergies which we expect to arise principally from facility consolidation and rationalization of supply chain relationships even if we are able to successfully integrate the operations of frutarom with ours we may not realize the full benefits of the acquisition if we are unable to identify and implement the anticipated cost savings or if the actions taken to implement such costsavings have unintended consequences on our other business operations 

if we do not successfully manage these issues and the other challenges inherent in integrating frutarom we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition we could incur unanticipated expenses and charges and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected 

the frutarom acquisition resulted and may continue to result in significant charges or other liabilities that could adversely affect the financial results of the combined company 

our financial results following the acquisition of frutarom were adversely affected by cash expenses and noncash accounting charges incurred in connection with the acquisition we expect these types of charges to continue as a result of the integration of the business and operations of frutarom as a result of the acquisition we assumed all of frutarom’s liabilities including unknown and contingent liabilities due to the nature of the transaction and the characteristics of frutarom our ability to conduct extensive due diligence was limited and we may subsequently identify additional obligations including those that frutarom assumed in its prior acquisitions during the measurement period prior to our acquisition frutarom completed 47 acquisitions since 2011 including 22 since the beginning of 2016 our ability to accurately identify and assess the magnitude of the liabilities assumed by frutarom in these acquisitions was limited by among other things the information available to us and frutarom and the limited operating experience that frutarom has with these acquired entities if we are not able to completely assess the scope of these liabilities or if these liabilities are neither probable nor estimable at this time our future financial results could be adversely affected by unanticipated reserves or charges unexpected litigation or regulatory exposure unfavorable accounting charges unexpected increases in taxes due a loss of anticipated tax benefits or other adverse effects on our business operating results or financial condition 

our incurrence of additional debt to pay the cash portion of the frutarom consideration increased our financial leverage and could adversely affect our future cash flows and cost of capital 

in connection with the acquisition of frutarom we borrowed approximately 33 billion  of additional debt consisting of 28 billion  of senior unsecured notes 3500 million  in term loans and 1395 million  of senior unsecured amortizing notes associated with the tangible equity units incurring this new debt significantly increased our leverage there may be circumstances in which required payments of principal andor interest on this new debt could adversely affect our cash flows our operating results or our ability to return capital to our shareholders through dividends or stock repurchases furthermore our degree of leverage could adversely affect our future credit ratings if we are unable to maintain or improve our current investment grade rating it could adversely affect our future cost of funding liquidity and access to capital markets in addition our current level of leverage could increase our vulnerability to sustained adverse macroeconomic weakness limit our ability to obtain further financing and our ability to pursue certain operational and strategic opportunities including large acquisitions 

if we are unable to successfully market to our expanded and decentralized taste and frutarom customer base our operating results and future growth may be adversely affected 

as a result of our acquisition of frutarom the number of our customers significantly increased and became more decentralized our historical customer base was primarily comprised of large food beverage and consumer products companies these customers have faced in recent years growing competition from mid and smallsized regional companies and companies focused on nicheproduct categories in connection with vision 2020 we identified serving these small and midsized clients as a key element of our business strategy and invested in this strategy through the introduction of tastepoint by iff in the us which resulted from the acquisitions of ottens flavors and david michael with the frutarom acquisition we have significantly expanded our customer base by approximately 39000  customers composed principally of globallylocated small and midsized companies this substantial increase in our customer base will require us to adjust our corporate information technology finance and administrative infrastructures and corporate sales and customer culture further we may experience difficulty managing the growth of a portfolio of customers that is diverse both with respect to the types of services they will require and the infrastructure required to deliver our products however if we are unable to successfully implement this strategy or gain market share with this growing customer base our future growth could be adversely affected 

  14 

our business is highly competitive and if we are unable to compete effectively our sales and results of operations will suffer 

the market for flavors fragrances and natural ingredients is highly competitive we face vigorous competition from companies throughout the world including multinational and specialized flavor fragrance and cosmetic ingredients companies as well as consumer product companies who may develop their own flavors fragrances or cosmetic ingredients in the flavors industry we also face increasing competition from ingredient suppliers that have expanded their portfolios to include flavor offerings some of our competitors specialize in one or more of our product subsegments while others participate in many of our product subsegments in addition some of our global competitors may have greater resources than we do or may have proprietary products that could permit them to respond to changing business and economic conditions more effectively than we can consolidation of our competitors may exacerbate these risks 

as we continue to enter into adjacent markets such as cosmetic ingredients and recently through the frutarom acquisition functional foods specialty fine ingredients and health and wellness products we may face greater competitionrelated risks in these markets than with our core historic flavor and fragrances businesses for example the specialty fine ingredients market is more price sensitive than the flavors market and is characterized by relatively lower profit margins some fine ingredients products manufactured by frutarom are less unique and more replaceable by competitors’ products there is no assurance that operating margins will not erode in the future which could substantially impact our business operating results and financial condition 

competition in our business is based on innovation product quality regulatory compliance pricing quality of customer service the support provided by marketing and application groups and understanding of consumers it is difficult for us to predict the timing scale and success of our competitors’ actions in these areas in particular the discovery and development of new flavors and fragrance compounds and ingredients protection of our intellectual property and development and retention of key employees are critical to our ability to effectively compete in our business increased competition by existing or future competitors including aggressive price competition could result in the potential loss of substantial sales or create the need for us to reduce prices or increase spending and this could have an adverse impact on sales and profitability 

if we are unable to provide our customers with innovative costeffective products that allow them to achieve their own profitability expectations our sales and results of operations will suffer 

during 2018 our 25 largest customers accounted for 47  of our sales and the largest customer across all enduse categories accounted for 9 to 12   of our sales for each of the last three fiscal years loss of or a reduction in sales to our largest customer or any of our other large customers for an extended period of time could adversely affect our business or financial results 

large multinational customers and increasingly middlemarket customers are unilaterally limiting the number of their suppliers or rationalizing the number of products that they offer to increase their margins and profitability as part of these initiatives these customers are creating “core lists” of suppliers and giving these “core lists” suppliers priority for new or modified products recently these customers are making inclusion on their “core lists” contingent upon a supplier providing more favorable commercial terms including rebates which could adversely affect our margins we must either offer competitive costinuse solutions to secure and maintain inclusion on these “core lists” or seek to manage the relationship without being on the “corelist” if we chose not to pursue “corelist” status due to profitability concerns or if we are unable to obtain “corelist” status our ability to maintain our share of the customers’ future purchases could be adversely affected and therefore our future results of operations 

furthermore consolidations amongst our customers have resulted in larger and more sophisticated customers with greater buying power and additional negotiating strength these and other profitability initiatives being pursued by our customers reduce the market opportunity for which we compete and subject the volume and pricing of the remaining suppliers to downward pressure to be successful in this competitive environment we must continue to make investments in customer relationships and tailor product research and development in order to anticipate customers’ needs deliver products that contribute to our customers’ profitability and provide effective customer service 

we may not successfully develop and introduce new products that meet our customers’ needs which may adversely affect our results of operations 

our ability to differentiate ourselves and deliver growth in line with our vision 2020 strategy largely depends on our ability to successfully develop and introduce new products and product improvements that meet our customers’ needs and ultimately appeal to consumers innovation is a key element of our ability to develop and introduce new products we cannot be certain that we will be successful in achieving our innovation goals such as the development of new molecules new and 

  15 

expanded delivery systems and other technologies we currently spend approximately 8  of our sales on research and development however such investments may only generate future revenues to the extent that we are able to develop products that meet our customers’ specifications are at an acceptable cost and achieve acceptance by the targeted consumer market furthermore there may be significant lag times from the time we incur rd costs to the time that these rd costs may result in increased revenue consequently even when we “win” a project our ability to generate revenues as a result of these investments is subject to numerous customer economic and other risks that are outside of our control including delays by our customers in the launch of a new product the level of promotional support for the launch poor performance of our thirdparty vendors anticipated sales by our customers not being realized or changes in market preferences or demands or disruptive innovations by competitors 

a disruption in our manufacturing operations or our supply chain could adversely affect our business and financial results 

as a company engaged in the global development manufacture and distribution of products we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities including industrial accidents environmental events strikes and other labor disputes product quality control issues safety licensing requirements and other regulatory issues as well as natural disasters international conflicts terrorist acts and other external factors over which we have no control while we operate research and development manufacturing and distribution facilities throughout the world many of these facilities are extremely specialized and certain of our rd or creative laboratories facilities are uniquely situated to support our research and development efforts while certain of our manufacturing facilities are the sole location where a specific ingredient or product is produced if our research and development activities or the manufacturing of ingredients or products were disrupted the cost of relocating or replacing these activities or reformulating these ingredients or products may be substantial which could result in production or development delays or otherwise have an adverse effect on our margins operating results and future growth 

a disruption in our supply chain including the inability to obtain ingredients and raw materials from third parties could adversely affect our business and financial results 

in connection with our manufacture of our fragrance and flavor compounds we often rely on third party suppliers for ingredients and raw materials that are integral to our manufacture of such compounds our purchases of raw materials are subject to fluctuations in market price and availability caused by weather climate change growing and harvesting conditions market conditions governmental actions and other factors beyond our control our natural products and ingredients may also be subject to import alerts or specific country regulations that would impair our ability to obtain sufficient quantity at the relevant manufacturing facility in addition our ingredient suppliers similar to us are subject to the risks inherent in manufacturing and distribution on a global scale including industrial accidents environmental events strikes and other labor disputes disruptions in supply chain or information systems disruption or loss of key research or manufacturing sites product quality control safety and environmental compliance issues licensing requirements and other regulatory issues as well as natural disasters international conflicts terrorist acts and other external factors over which they have no control these suppliers also could become insolvent or experience other financial distress for example a fire at the manufacturing facility of basf group “basf” one of our suppliers in 2017 caused them to declare a force majeure and has resulted in a disruption of the availability of certain ingredients used in some of our fragrance and flavor compounds if our suppliers are unable to supply us with sufficient ingredients and raw materials to meet our needs we would need to seek alternative sources of such materials or pursue our own production of such ingredients or direct acquisition of such raw materials however for certain of our raw ingredients and raw materials we rely on a limited number of suppliers where there are not readily available alternatives if we are unable to obtain or manufacture alternative sources of such ingredients or raw materials at a similar cost we would seek to i reformulate our compounds andor ii increase pricing to reflect the higher supply cost however if we are not able to successfully implement any of these alternatives we could experience disruptions in production increased cost of sales and a corresponding decrease in gross margin or reduced sales if our competitors were able to more successfully adjust to such market disruption such fluctuations and decrease in gross margin could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

volatility and increases in the price of raw materials energy and transportation could harm our profits 

we use many different raw materials for our business including essential oils extracts and concentrates derived from fruits vegetables flowers woods and other botanicals animal products raw fruits organic chemicals and petroleumbased chemicals historically we have experienced a considerable amount of price volatility in natural products that represent approximately half of our raw material purchases and we expect this volatility to continue in the near future for example during and in 2018 we experienced increases in the prices of certain naturals including citrus in addition because frutarom’s number of natural product offerings is substantial this risk may be exacerbated availability and pricing of these natural products can be impacted by crop size and quality weather climate change alternative land use and other factors which we cannot control 

  16 

if we are unable to increase the prices to our customers of our flavor or fragrance compounds or natural ingredient products to offset raw material and other input cost increases or if we are unable to achieve cost savings to offset such cost increases we could fail to meet our cost expectations and our profits and operating results could be adversely affected increases in prices of our products to customers may lead to declines in volume and we may not be able to accurately predict the volume impact of price increases which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

similarly commodities and energy prices are subject to significant volatility caused by market fluctuations supply and demand currency fluctuations production and transportation disruptions and other world events as we source many of our raw materials globally to help ensure quality control if the cost of energy shipping or transportation increases and we are unable to pass along these costs to our customers our profit margins would be adversely affected furthermore increasing our prices to our customers could result in longterm sales declines or loss of market share if our customers find alternative suppliers or choose to reformulate their consumer products to use fewer ingredients which could have an adverse longterm impact on our results of operations 

to mitigate our sourcing risk we maintain strategic stock levels for critical items however if we do not accurately estimate the amount of raw materials that will be used for the geographic region in which we will need these materials our margins could be adversely affected 

if we are unable to comply with regulatory requirements and industry standards including those regarding product safety quality efficacy and environmental impact we could incur significant costs and suffer reputational harm which could adversely affect results of operations 

the development manufacture and sale of our products are subject to various regulatory requirements in each of the countries in which our products are developed manufactured and sold in addition we are subject to product safety and compliance requirements established by the industry or similar oversight bodies or contractually by our customers including requirements concerning product safety quality and efficacy environmental impacts including packaging energy and water use and waste management and other sustainability or similar issues we use a variety of strategies methodologies and tools to i identify current product standards ii assess relative risks in our supply chain that can impact product integrity iii monitor internal and external performance and iv test raw materials and finished goods to minimize the likelihood of product or process noncompliance 

gaps in our operational processes or those of our suppliers can result in products that do not meet our quality control standards or industry standards or fail to comply with the relevant regulatory requirements which in turn can result in finished consumer goods that do not comply with these standards and requirements products that are mislabeled contaminated or damaged could result in a regulatory noncompliance event or even a product recall by the fda or a similar foreign agency our contracts often require us to indemnify our customers for the costs associated with a product noncompliance event including penalties costs and settlements arising from litigation remediation costs or loss of sales as our flavors and fragrance compounds and ingredients are used in many products intended for human use or consumption these consequences would be exacerbated if we or our customer did not identify the defect before the product reaches the consumer and there was a resulting impact at the consumer level such a result could lead to potentially large scale adverse publicity negative effects on consumer’s health recalls and potential consumer litigation in addition if we do not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification from suppliers or other third parties or if insurance or indemnification is not available the liability relating to product or possible thirdparty claims arising from mislabeled contaminated or damaged products could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations furthermore adverse publicity about our products or our customers’ products that contain our ingredients including concerns about product safety or similar issues whether real or perceived could harm our reputation and result in an immediate adverse effect on our sales and customer relationships as well as require us to utilize significant resources to rebuild our reputation 

the interruption or failure of key information technology systems or a loss of data malicious attack or other breach of security of our information technology systems may have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business subject us to increased operating costs damage our reputation and expose us to litigation 

we rely on information technology systems including some managed by thirdparty providers to conduct business and support our business processes including product formulas product development sales order processing production distribution internal communications and communications with third parties throughout the world processing transactions summarizing and reporting results of operations complying with regulatory tax or legal requirements and collecting and storing customer supplier employee and other stakeholder information the frutarom acquisition may also pose additional burden on our information technology systems as we integrate our information and financial systems into our newly acquired facilities these systems may be susceptible to disruptions or outages due to fire floods power loss telecommunications failures natural disasters cyberattacks failed upgrades or other similar events or due to the poor performance of thirdparty 

  17 

providers an effective response to disruptions will require effort and diligence on the part of our employees and thirdparty providers to avoid any adverse impact to our business in addition our systems and proprietary data stored electronically may be vulnerable to computer viruses cybercrime computer hacking and similar information security breaches which in turn could result in the unauthorized release or misuse of confidential or proprietary information about our business including but not limited to the trade secrets upon which we rely to protect our proprietary fragrance and flavor formulations employees or customers and disrupt our operations depending on their nature and scope these threats could potentially lead to improper use of our systems and networks manipulation and destruction of data or product noncompliance the occurrence of any of these events could disrupt our business and have a material adverse effect on our sales subject us to increased operating costs damage our reputation and expose us to litigation or regulatory proceedings 

increasing awareness of health and wellness are driving changes in the consumer products industry and if we are unable to react in a timely and costeffective manner our results of operations and future growth may be adversely affected 

we must continually anticipate and react in a timely and costeffective manner to changes in consumer preferences and demands including changes in demand driven by increasing awareness of health and wellness and demands for transparency with respect to product ingredients consumers especially in developed economies such as the us and western europe are shifting away from products containing artificial ingredients to all natural healthier alternatives in addition there has been a growing demand by consumers nongovernmental organizations and to a lesser extent governmental agencies to provide more transparency in product labeling and our customers have been taking steps to address this demand including by voluntarily providing productspecific ingredients disclosure these two trends could affect the types and volumes of our ingredients and compounds that our customers include in their consumer product offerings if we are unable to react to or anticipate these trends in a timely and costeffective manner our results of operations and future growth may be adversely affected 

if we are unable to successfully establish and manage collaborations joint ventures or partnerships that lead to development or commercialization of products it could adversely affect our growth 

from time to time we evaluate and enter into collaborations joint ventures or partnerships to enhance our research and development efforts or expand our materials portfolio or technology the process of establishing and maintaining collaborative relationships is difficult and timeconsuming to negotiate document and implement we may not be able to successfully negotiate these arrangements or the terms of the arrangements may not be as favorable as anticipated furthermore our ability to generate revenues from such collaborations will depend on our partners’ abilities and efforts to successfully perform the functions assigned to them in these arrangements and these collaborations may not lead to development or commercialization of products in the most efficient manner or at all in addition from time to time frutarom has acquired and we intend to continue to acquire only a majority interest in companies and providing earnouts for the former owners and the ability for us to acquire the minority interests at a future date at an established price these investments may have additional risks and may not be as efficient as other operations as we may have fiduciary or contractual obligations to the minority investors if we are unable to successfully establish and manage these collaborative relationships and majority investments it could adversely affect our future growth 

we have made investments in and continue to expand our business into emerging markets which exposes us to certain risks 

as part of our growth strategy we have increased our presence in emerging markets by expanding our manufacturing presence sales organization and product offerings in these markets and we expect to continue to expand our business in these markets with our combination with frutarom who also had a significant presence in emerging markets our business in these markets has meaningfully grown in addition to the currency and international risks described below our operations in these markets may be subject to a variety of other risks emerging markets typically have a consumer base with limited or fluctuating disposable income and customer demand in these markets may fluctuate accordingly as a result decrease in customer demand in emerging markets may have an adverse effect on our ability to execute our growth strategy further there is no assurance that our existing products variants of our existing products or new products that we make manufacture distribute or sell will be accepted or be successful in any particular developing or emerging market due to local or global competition product price cultural differences consumer preferences or otherwise in addition emerging markets may have weak legal systems which may affect our ability to enforce our intellectual property and contractual rights exchange controls unstable governments and privatization or other government actions that may affect taxes subsidies and incentive programs and the flow of goods and currency in conducting our business we move products from one country to another and may provide services in one country from a subsidiary located in another country accordingly we are vulnerable to abrupt changes in trade customs and tax regimes in these markets if we are unable to expand our business in developing and emerging 

  18 

markets effectively operate or manage the risks associated with operating in these markets or achieve the return on capital we expect from our investments in these markets our operating results and future growth could be adversely affected 

the impact of currency fluctuation or devaluation in the international markets in which we operate may negatively affect our results of operations 

we have significant operations outside the us the results of which are reported in the local currency and then translated into us dollars at applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements the exchange rates between these currencies and the us dollar have fluctuated and will continue to do so in the future for example as of july 1 2018 we concluded that argentina’s economy is highly inflationary under us gaap as it has experienced cumulative inflation of approximately 100 or more over a threeyear period while our current operations in argentina represent less than 3 of our consolidated net sales and less than 1  of our consolidated total assets continuing inflation in argentina could adversely affect our profitability in a specific period with our increased operations in emerging markets arising from our frutarom acquisition these risks will become exacerbated changes in exchange rates between these local currencies and the us dollar will affect the recorded levels of sales profitability assets andor liabilities additionally volatility in currency exchange rates may adversely impact our financial condition cash flows or liquidity although we employ a variety of techniques to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations including sourcing strategies and a limited number of foreign currency hedging activities we cannot guarantee that such hedging and risk management strategies will be effective and our results of operations could be adversely affected 

our international operations are subject to regulatory political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues cash flows or financial position 

we operate on a global basis with manufacturing and sales facilities in the us europe africa the middle east latin america israel and greater asia during 2018 75  of our net sales and as a result of our acquisition of frutarom 80  of our combined net sales were to customers outside the us and we intend to continue expansion of our international operations as a result our business is increasingly exposed to risks inherent in international operations these risks which can vary substantially by location include the following 



  19 

the occurrence of any one or more of these factors could increase our costs and adversely affect our results of operations 

economic uncertainty may adversely affect demand for our products which may have a negative impact on our operating results and future growth 

our flavors and fragrance compounds and our fragrance cosmetic active and functional food ingredients are components of a wide assortment of global consumer products throughout the world historically demand for consumer products using these compounds and ingredients was stimulated and broadened by changing social habits and consumer needs population growth an expanding global middleclass and general economic growth especially in emerging markets the global economy has experienced significant recessionary pressures and declines in consumer confidence and economic growth while some segments of the global economy appear to be recovering the predictions surrounding the global recessionary economic environment in europe has and may in the near future increase unemployment and underemployment decrease salaries and wage rates increase inflation or result in other marketwide cost pressures that will adversely affect demand for consumer products in both developed and emerging markets in addition growth rates in the emerging markets have moderated from previous levels reduced consumer spending may cause changes in our customer orders including reduced demand for our flavors and fragrances compounds or ingredients or order cancellations 

the timing of placing of orders and the amounts of these orders are generally at our customers discretion customers may cancel reduce or postpone orders with us on relatively short notice significant cancellations reductions or delays in orders by customers could affect our quarterly results 

it is currently anticipated that these challenging economic uncertainties will continue to affect certain of our markets during 2019 which could adversely affect our sales profitability and overall operating results 

our success depends on attracting and retaining talented people within our business significant shortfalls in recruitment or retention could adversely affect our ability to compete and achieve our strategic goals 

attracting developing and retaining talented employees including our perfumers scientists and flavorists is essential to the successful delivery of our products and success in the marketplace furthermore as we continue to focus on innovation our need for scientists and other professionals will increase an important factor in our ability to realize our anticipated benefits from the frutarom acquisition is our ability to retain key employees at frutarom the ability to attract and retain talented employees is critical in the development of new products and technologies which is an integral component of our growth strategy 

competition for employees can be intense and if we are unable to successfully integrate motivate and reward the acquired frutarom employees or our current employees in our combined company we may not be able to retain them however if we are unable to retain these employees or attract new employees in the future our ability to effectively compete with our competitors and to grow our business could be adversely affected 

failure to comply with environmental protection laws may cause us to close relocate or operate one or more of our plants at reduced production levels and expose us to civil or criminal liability which could adversely affect our operating results and future growth 

our business operations and properties make use of manufacture sell and distribute substances that are sometimes considered hazardous and are therefore subject to extensive and increasingly stringent federal state local and foreign laws and regulations pertaining to protection of the environment including air emissions sewage discharges the use of hazardous materials waste disposal practices and cleanup of existing environmental contamination failure to comply with these laws and regulations or any future changes to them may result in significant consequences to us including the need to close or relocate one or more of our production facilities administrative civil and criminal penalties liability for damages and negative publicity if we are unable to meet production requirements we can lose customer orders which can adversely affect our future growth or we may be required to make incremental capital investments to ensure supply for example in 2015 chinese authorities notified us of compliance issues pertaining to the emission of odors from several of our plants in china and consequently we invested approximately 65 million in odorabatement equipment at these facilities and have built a second flavors manufacturing facility in china with an estimated cost of 45 million we have also recently completed negotiations with the chinese government concerning the relocation of a second fragrance facility in china idling of facilities or production modifications has caused or may cause customers to seek alternate suppliers due to concerns regarding supply interruptions and these customers may not return or may order at reduced levels even once issues are remediated if these noncompliance issues reoccur in china or occur or in any other jurisdiction we may lose business and may be required to incur capital spending above previous expectations close a plant or operate a plant at significantly reduced production levels on a permanent basis and our operating results and cash flows from operations may be adversely affected 

  20 

our ongoing optimization of our manufacturing facilities may not be as effective as we anticipate and we may fail to realize the expected cost savings and increased efficiencies 

as part of our ongoing strategy we seek to enhance our manufacturing efficiency and align our geographic manufacturing footprint with our expectations of future growth and technology needs 

for example we are in the process of relocating one of our fragrance ingredients facilities in china constructing new facilities in india and indonesia and other capital projects required to integrate our recently acquired frutarom business the spending associated with these projects may result in capital spending above previous expectations which could adversely affect our cash flows 

in addition an integral component of our synergy strategy for the frutarom acquisition is focused on rationalizing the aggregate number of sites that the combined company operates our ability to realize anticipated cost savings and synergies from these activities may be affected by various factors and may pose significant risks including 

 furthermore actual charges costs and adjustments due to these activities may vary materially from our estimates and these activities may require cash and noncash integration and implementation costs or charges in excess of budgeted amounts which could offset any such savings and other synergies and therefore could have an adverse effect on our margins 

our performance may be adversely impacted if we are not successful in managing our inventory andor working capital balances 

we evaluate our inventory balances of materials based on shelf life expected sourcing levels known uses and anticipated demand based on forecasted customer order activity and changes in our productsales mix efficient inventory management is a key component of our business success financial returns and profitability to be successful we must maintain sufficient inventory levels and an appropriate productsales mix to meet our customers’ demands without allowing those levels to increase to such an extent that the costs associated with storing and holding other inventory adversely impact our financial results if our buying decisions do not accurately predict sourcing levels customer trends or our expectations about customer needs are inaccurate we may have to take unanticipated markdowns or impairment charges to dispose of the excess or obsolete inventory which can adversely impact our financial results additionally we believe excess inventory levels of raw materials with a short shelf life in our manufacturing facilities subjects us to the risk of increased inventory shrinkage if we are not successful in managing our inventory balances and shrinkage our results of and cash flows from operations may be negatively affected 

we sell certain accounts receivable on a nonrecourse basis to unrelated financial institutions under “factoring” agreements that are sponsored solely and individually by certain customers the cost of participating in these programs was immaterial to our results in all periods should we choose not to participate or if these programs were no longer available it could reduce our cash flows from operations in the period in which the arrangement ends 

we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act or similar us or foreign antibribery and anticorruption laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate 

the global nature of our business the significance of our international revenue and our focus on emerging markets create various domestic and local regulatory challenges and subject us to risks associated with our international operations the us foreign corrupt practices act or fcpa and similar antibribery and anticorruption laws and regulations in other countries generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or for other commercial advantage in addition us public companies are required to maintain records that accurately and fairly represent their transactions and have an adequate system of internal accounting controls under the fcpa us companies may be held liable for the corrupt actions taken by directors officers employees 

  21 

agents or other strategic or local partners or representatives as such if we or our intermediaries fail to comply with the requirements of the fcpa or similar legislation governmental authorities in the us and elsewhere could seek to impose substantial civil andor criminal fines and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation operating results and financial condition 

we operate or may pursue opportunities in some jurisdictions such as china india brazil russia and africa which pose potentially elevated risks of fraud or corruption or increased risk of internal control issues in certain jurisdictions compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices from time to time we have conducted and will conduct internal investigations of the relevant facts and circumstances control testing and compliance reviews and take remedial actions when appropriate to help ensure that we are in compliance with applicable corruption and similar laws and regulations in addition frutarom grew through rapid acquisition and as part of our integration efforts we will be seeking to implement our anticorruption and similar policies throughout a number of those acquired companies many of which were not previously subject to these us laws 

detecting investigating and resolving actual or alleged violations of the fcpa or similar laws is expensive and could consume significant time and attention of our senior management we could be subject to inquiries or investigations by government and other regulatory bodies any allegations of noncompliance with the fcpa or similar laws could have a disruptive effect on our operations in such jurisdiction over the near term including interruptions of business or loss of thirdparty relationships which may negatively impact our results of operations or financial condition any determination that our operations or activities are not in compliance with the fcpa or similar laws could expose us to severe criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions significant fines termination of necessary licenses and permits and penalties or other sanctions that may harm our business and reputation 

our ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights 

we rely on patents and trade secrets to protect our intellectual property rights we often rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary fragrance and flavor formulations as well as our extract methodologies and processes for our nutraceutical natural colors for food and natural antioxidants for food protection as this does not require us to publicly file information regarding our intellectual property from time to time a third party may claim that we have infringed upon or misappropriated their intellectual property rights or a third party may infringe upon or misappropriate our intellectual property rights we could incur significant costs in connection with legal actions to assert our intellectual property rights against third parties or to defend ourselves from third party assertions of invalidity infringement or misappropriation or other claims any settlement or adverse judgment resulting from such litigation could require us to obtain a license to continue to use the intellectual property rights that are the subject of the claim or otherwise restrict or prohibit our use of such intellectual property rights any required licensing fees may not be available to us on acceptable terms if at all for those intellectual property rights that are protected as trade secrets this litigation could result in even higher costs and potentially the loss of certain rights since we would not have a perfected intellectual property right that precludes others from making using or selling our products or processes the ongoing trend among our customers towards more transparent labeling could further diminish our ability to effectively protect our proprietary flavor formulations 

for intellectual property rights that we seek to protect through patents we cannot be certain that these rights if obtained will not later be opposed invalidated or circumvented in addition even if such rights are obtained in the us the laws of some of the other countries in which our products are or may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us if other parties were to infringe on our intellectual property rights or if a third party successfully asserted that we had infringed on their intellectual property rights it could materially and adversely affect our future results of operations by i reducing the price that we could obtain in the marketplace for products which are based on such rights ii increasing the royalty or other fees that we may be required to pay in connection with such rights or iii limiting the volume if any of such products that we can sell 

our results of operations may be negatively impacted by the outcome of uncertainties related to litigation 

from time to time we are involved in a number of legal claims regulatory investigations and litigation including claims related to intellectual property product liability environmental matters and indirect taxes for instance product liability claims may arise due to the fact that we supply flavors and fragrances to the food and beverage functional food pharmanutraceutical and personal care industries our manufacturing and other facilities may expose us to environmental claims and regulatory investigations in addition as we expand our product offering into functional food nutraceuticals and natural antioxidants we may also be subject to claims of false or deceptive advertising claims in the us europe and other foreign jurisdictions in which we offer these types of products these claims can arise as a result of function claims health claims nutrient content claims and other claims that impermissibly suggest therapeutic benefits for certain foods or food 

  22 

components the cost of defending these claims or our obligations for direct damages and indemnification if we were found liable could adversely affect our profitability and our results of operations 

as a result of the acquisition of frutarom we assumed a number of legal claims regulatory investigations and litigation and we may become involved in additional actions in the future arising from the acquired operations specifically as frutarom has a significantly greater number of facilities that are located globally and a significantly larger number of customers our exposure to these type of environmental claims product liability claims and regulatory investigations may increase this could result in an increase in our cost for defense or settlement of claims or indemnification obligations if we were to be found liable in excess of our historical experience our insurance may not be adequate to protect us from all material expenses related to pending and future claims and our current levels of insurance may not be available in the future at commercially reasonable prices any of these factors could adversely affect our profitability and results of operations 

our funding obligations for our pension and postretirement plans could adversely affect our earnings and cash flows 

the funding obligations for our pension plans are impacted by the performance of the financial markets particularly the equity markets and interest rates funding obligations are determined under government regulations and are measured each year based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date if the financial markets do not provide the longterm returns that are expected under the governmental funding calculations we could be required to make larger contributions the equity markets can be very volatile and therefore our estimate of future contribution requirements can change dramatically in relatively short periods of time similarly changes in interest rates and legislation enacted by governmental authorities can impact the timing and amounts of contribution requirements an adverse change in the funded status of the plans could significantly increase our required contributions in the future and adversely impact our liquidity 

assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans are determined by us in consultation with outside consultants and advisors in the event that we determine that changes are warranted in the assumptions used such as the discount rate expected longterm rate of return on assets or expected health care costs our future pension and postretirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease due to changing market conditions or changes in the participant population the assumptions that we use may differ from actual results which could have a significant impact on our pension and postretirement liabilities and related costs and funding requirements 

any future impairment of our tangible or intangible longlived assets may adversely impact our profitability 

a significant portion of our assets consists of longlived assets including tangible assets such as our manufacturing facilities and intangible assets and goodwill as a result of numerous recent acquisitions including the 2018 acquisition of frutarom as of december 31 2018 we had recorded approximately 84 billion  of intangible assets and goodwill including goodwill and intangible assets related to our acquisitions after the frutarom acquisition was completed for instance we recorded a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets on our consolidated financial statements longlived assets are subject to an impairment analysis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable for example the amount of goodwill that we recorded from the frutarom acquisition could be subject to impairment based upon future adverse changes in our business or prospects including our inability to recognize the benefits anticipated by the transaction additionally goodwill is subject to an impairment test at least annually indicators such as under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results changes in our strategy for its overall business or use of acquired assets unexpected negative industry or economic trends decreased market capitalization relative to net book values unanticipated competitive activities change in consumer demand loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts may signal that an asset has become impaired to the extent any of our acquisitions do not perform as anticipated whether due to internal or external factors the value of such assets may be negatively affected and we may be required to record impairment charges our results of operations and financial position in future periods could be negatively impacted should future impairments of our longlived assets including intangible assets or goodwill occur 

changes in our tax rates the adoption of new us or international tax legislation or changes in existing tax laws could expose us to additional tax liabilities that may affect our future results 

we are subject to taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in liabilities for uncertain tax positions cost of repatriations or changes in tax laws or their interpretation any of these changes could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 

we have and will continue to implement transfer pricing policies among our various operations located in different countries these transfer pricing policies are a significant component of the management and compliance of our operations across international boundaries and overall financial results many countries routinely examine transfer pricing policies of 

  23 

taxpayers subject to their jurisdiction challenge transfer pricing policies aggressively where there is potential noncompliance and impose significant interest charges and penalties where noncompliance is determined however governmental authorities could challenge these policies more aggressively in the future and if challenged we may not prevail we could suffer significant costs related to one or more challenges to our transfer pricing policies 

we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and foreign tax authorities in those countries in which we operate and we may be subject to assessments or audits in the future in any of the countries in which we operate the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals and while we do not believe the results that follow would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition such results could have a material effect on our income tax provision net income or cash flows in the period or periods in which that determination is made 

in addition a number of international legislative and regulatory bodies have proposed legislation and begun investigations of the tax practices of multinational companies and in the european union the tax policies of certain european union member states one of these efforts has been led by the organisation for economic cooperation and development an international association of 34 countries including the us which has finalized recommendations to revise corporate tax transfer pricing and tax treaty provisions in member countries since 2013 the european commission “ec” has been investigating tax rulings granted by tax authorities in a number of european union member states with respect to specific multinational corporations to determine whether such rulings comply with european union rules on state aid as well as more recent investigations of the tax regimes of certain european union member states under european union law selective tax advantages for particular taxpayers that are not sufficiently grounded in economic realities may constitute impermissible state aid if the ec determines that a tax ruling or tax regime violates the state aid restrictions the tax authorities of the affected european union member state may be required to collect back taxes for the period of time covered by the ruling in late 2015 and early 2016 the ec declared that tax rulings related to other companies by tax authorities in luxembourg the netherlands and belgium did not comply with the european union state aid restrictions if the ec were to successfully challenge tax rulings applicable to us in any of the member states in which we are subject to taxation we could be exposed to increased tax liabilities 

the recently adopted us tax legislation may result in additional tax liabilities that may affect our future results and profitability 

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” that significantly revised the us tax code effective january 1 2018 by among other things lowering the corporate income tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35 to a flat 21 limiting deductibility of interest expense and performance based incentive compensation transitioning to a territorial system and creating new taxes associated with global operations the tax act impacted our consolidated results of operations during 2018 and is expected to continue to impact our consolidated results of operations in future periods in future periods we expect that our effective tax rate will be impacted by the lower us corporate tax rate that will initially be offset by the elimination of the deductibility of performance based incentive compensation and other provisions of the tax act that may impact us prospectively however the ultimate impact of the tax act will depend on additional regulatory or accounting guidance that may be issued with respect to the tax act and any operating and structural changes that we may undertake to permit us to benefit from the new lower us tax rate prospectively this could adversely affect our results of operations 

the potential government regulation of certain of our product development initiatives is uncertain and we may be subject to adverse consequences if we fail to comply with applicable regulations 

as part of our ingredients research program we seek to enhance our collaboration with research institutions and companies throughout the world including biotechnology companies however it is unclear whether any of our product developments will be classified as genetically modified food products subject to regulation as a biotechnology product the manufacture of biotechnology products is subject to applicable current good manufacturing practice cgmp regulations as prescribed by the food and drug administration and the applicable standards prescribed by european commission and the competent authorities of european union member states and to other rules and regulations prescribed by foreign regulatory authorities compliance with these regulations can be expensive and time consuming such regulation could also subject us to requirements for labeling and traceability which may cause our customers to avoid our affected products and seek our competitors’ products this may result in our inability to realize any benefit from our investment and have an adverse effect on our operating results 

our business may be negatively impacted as a result of the united kingdom’s expected departure from the european union in 2019 

  24 

we currently manufacture goods in the united kingdom for distribution in the european union and viceversa and therefore may be adversely affected as a result of the united kingdom’s expected departure from the european union in 2019 the united kingdom is expected to withdraw from the european union in march 2019 commonly referred to as “brexit” negotiations are still underway to determine the terms of the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the european union the progress and outcomes of brexit negotiations have and may continue to create global economic uncertainty especially as customers and potential customers are unable to currently gauge the future regulations and therefore costs that will apply to their operations in the united kingdom and between the united kingdom and the european union the withdrawal could among other outcomes exacerbate the disruption of the free movement of goods services and people between the united kingdom and the european union undermine bilateral cooperation in key geographic areas and significantly disrupt trade between the united kingdom and the european union or other nations as the united kingdom pursues independent trade relations in addition brexit has caused legal uncertainty which could last indefinitely and may potentially create divergent national laws and regulations as the united kingdom determines which european union laws to replace or replicate 

the effects of brexit will depend on any agreements the united kingdom makes to retain access to european union or other markets either during a transitional period or more permanently given the lack of comparable precedent it is unclear what financial trade and legal implications the withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union would have and how such withdrawal would affect us adverse consequences concerning brexit or the european union could include deterioration in global economic conditions instability in global financial markets political uncertainty volatility in currency exchange rates or adverse changes in the crossborder agreements currently in place any of which could have an adverse impact on our financial results in the future

legal proceedings

we are subject to various claims and legal actions in the ordinary course of our business 

environmental 

over the past 20 years various federal and state authorities and private parties have claimed that we are a potentially responsible party “prp” as a generator of waste materials for alleged pollution at a number of waste sites operated by third parties located principally in new jersey and have sought to recover costs incurred and to be incurred to clean up the sites 

we have been identified as a prp at seven  facilities operated by third parties at which investigation andor remediation activities may be ongoing we analyze our potential liability on at least a quarterly basis we accrue for environmental liabilities when they are probable and estimable we estimate our share of the total future cost for these sites to be less than 3 million  

while joint and several liability is authorized under federal and state environmental laws we believe the amounts we have paid and anticipate paying in the future for cleanup costs and damages at all sites are not material and will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity this assessment is based upon among other things the involvement of other prps at most of the sites the status of the proceedings including various settlement agreements and consent decrees and the extended time period over which payments will likely be made there can be no assurance however that future events will not require us to materially increase the amounts we anticipate paying for cleanup costs and damages at these sites and that such increased amounts will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

frutarom acquisition 

on october 4 2018 we completed the acquisition of frutarom industries ltd “frutarom” we acquired 100 of the equity of frutarom pursuant to a definitive agreement and plan of merger entered into on may 7 2018 frutarom is an israeli company that through its subsidiaries develops produces and markets tastes flavors and fine ingredients used in manufacturing food beverages flavors and fragrances pharmanutraceuticals cosmetics and personal care products primarily focused on natural products the acquisition was made in order to strengthen and broaden our customer base capabilities and geographic reach and is expected to result in exposure to more end markets including those with a focus on naturals and health and wellness

2018  financial performance overview 

sales in 2018  increased 17  on a reported basis and 15  on a currency neutral basis which excludes the effects of changes in currency with the effects of the frutarom acquisition contributing approximately 11  to reported growth rates and 10  to currency neutral growth rates taste achieved reported sales growth of 6  and currency neutral sales growth of 5  scent achieved sales growth of 6  on a reported basis and 4  on a currency neutral basis in 2018  from a geographic perspective north america noam europe africa and middle east eame greater asia ga and latin america la all delivered sales growth on a consolidated basis in 2018  led by eame 

overall our 2018  results continued to be driven by our strong emerging market presence that represented 48  of total sales and experienced 17  growth on a reported basis and 16  growth on a currency neutral basis in 2018  we continue to benefit from our diverse portfolio of products and geographies and had sales growth in our taste and scent business units both taste and scent benefited from new win performance net of losses exchange rate variations did not have a material impact on revenue in 2018  the effect of exchange rates can vary by business and region depending upon the mix of sales by country as well as the relative percentage of local sales priced in us dollars versus local currencies we saw currency neutral sales growth during each quarter of 2018  

our 25 largest customers accounted for 47  of total sales in 2018  this percentage has remained fairly constant for several years sales to our largest customer across all enduse categories accounted for 9 to 12   of our sales for each of the last three fiscal years a key factor for commercial success is inclusion on our strategic customers’ core supplier lists which provides opportunities to win new business we are on the core supplier lists of a large majority of our global and strategic customers within flavors and fragrances

cash flows from operations were 4376 million  or 110  of sales in 2018  as compared to cash flows from operations of 3908 million  or 115  of sales during 2017  the increase in operating cash flows in 2018  as compared to 2017  was principally driven by lower litigation settlement and pension payments and higher net income offset by higher net working principally related to inventories 

our capital spend was 1701 million   43  of sales during 2018  in light of our requirement to begin relocating one of our fragrance ingredients facilities in china the ongoing construction of new facilities in india and indonesia and capital 

  38 

requirements to integrate our recently acquired frutarom business we expect that capital spending in 2019  will be about 5 6  of sales net of potential grants and other reimbursements from government authorities 

effective the first quarter of 2018 we adopted new accounting guidance related to revenue recognition and the presentation of pension costs the revenue recognition guidance was adopted effective the first day of fiscal 2018 and prior period amounts were not revised to conform to the new guidance the adoption of the new revenue guidance did not have a material impact on our results of operations the guidance related to the presentation of pension costs was applied retroactively and prior period amounts have been adjusted to conform to the new guidance as noted in note 16  to the consolidated financial statements the net effect of the change was to decrease operating profit and increase other income 

2019  outlook 

we believe that market conditions and the macroeconomic environment will continue to be volatile in many markets in 2019  but that overall there will be slight improvements as compared to recent years pressures from increasing costs and the impact of supply chain disruptions related to key ingredients used in the flavors and fragrance industry may reduce our currency neutral operating profit growth in 2019  

during 2018  the raw material cost environment continued its recent upward trend we believe that for the next several quarters we will continue to see higher costs of raw materials across a range of categories raw material costs continue to be impacted by supply chain disruptions mainly impacting our scent business unit we continue to seek improvements in our margins through operational performance cost reduction efforts and mix enhancement as well as integration savings with frutarom 

on a longterm basis we expect that sales growth for the industry will generally be in line with the underlying assumptions that support our longterm strategic goals albeit with some risk in the near term given the continuing global economic uncertainty we believe changing social habits resulting from increased disposable income improved focus on personal health and wellness awareness should help drive growth of our consumer product customers’ businesses

scent business unit 

scent segment profit increased   106 million  to 3295 million  in 2018  compared to 3190 million  reported in 2017  primarily due to new win performance net of losses and price increases principally due to increases in raw material input costs which were partially offset by volume reductions on existing business segment profit as a percentage of segment sales decreased to 175  in 2018 from 181  in 2017 primarily due to the impact of unfavorable price versus input costs including the net impact of the basf supply chain disruption and increases in rd and selling and administrative expenses partially offset by new win performance net of losses

frutarom segment profit was 274 million  for the fourth quarter of 2018  76  of segment sales excluding 236 million related to amortization of inventory stepup costs 

global expenses 

global expenses represent corporate and headquarterrelated expenses which include legal finance human resources and rd and other administrative expenses that are not allocated to an individual business unit in 2018  global expenses were 747 million  compared to 608 million  during 2017  the increase was principally driven by lower gains from our currency hedging program offset by reductions in incentive compensation expense 

  43 

interest expense 

in 2018  interest expense increased 672 million  to 1326 million  compared to 654 million  in 2017  primarily driven by 394 million of bridge loan commitment fees and 77 million of accrued unpaid interest on the repurchased senior notes  2007 and increased interest expense related to the public debt issued in 2018 to finance the acquisition of frutarom average cost of debt was 43 for the 2018  period compared to 41 in 2017  

other income expense net 

other income net decreased approximately 145 million  to 352 million  of income in 2018  versus 498 million  of income in 2017  the decrease was largely driven by decreases in gains on foreign currency of approximately 8 million year over year as well as a decrease in pension related other net income 

loss on extinguishment of debt 

loss on extinguishment of debt was 388 million  in the third quarter of 2018  the loss on extinguishment of debt is driven by a 349 million make whole payment on the senior notes  2007 and a 39 million realized loss on the termination of a fair value hedge 

income taxes 

the effective tax rate was 241  in 2018  as compared to 449  in 2017  the yearoveryear reduction principally relates to lower us tax reform charges in 2018 partially offset by nondeductible frutarom acquisition costs an unfavorable mix of earnings lower loss provisions and a lower level of reversals of valuation allowances on us state deferred taxes excluding 253 million  related to the us tax reform frutarom acquisition costs of 285 million  fda mandated product recall costs of 16 million  integration related costs of 14 million  restructuring and other charges net of 10 million  operational improvement initiative costs of 07 million  gain on sale of assets of 04 million  and acquisition related costs of 03 million  the adjusted effective tax rate for 2018  was 184  for 2017  the adjusted tax rate was 207  excluding 1392 million related to the impact of the us tax reform legal chargescredits net of 04 million acquisition related costs of 65 million gain on sale of assets of 01 million operational improvement initiative costs of 05 million restructuring and other charges net of 55 million fda mandated product recall costs of 39 million uk pension settlement charge of 05 million tax assessment of 19 million and integration related costs of 13 million 

us tax reform 

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” that significantly revised the us tax code effective january 1 2018 by among other things lowering the corporate income tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35  to a flat 21  and establishing a modified territorial system requiring a mandatory deemed repatriation tax on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries beginning in 2018 the act also requires a minimum tax on certain future earnings generated by foreign subsidiaries while providing for future taxfree repatriation of such earnings through a 100 dividendsreceived deduction for us federal income tax purposes 

the tax act impacted the companys consolidated results of operations during the 2017 fourth quarter in particular the transition to the new territorial tax system required the company to record a onetime tax or “toll charge” which resulted in a provisional incremental tax expense of 1006 million  principally related to previously unremitted earnings on nonus subsidiaries the cash portion of the toll charge is payable in installments over 8  years beginning in 2018 in addition the reduction of the us corporate tax rate resulted in a provisional net deferred tax expense of 386 million  related to the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets as a result of the reduction in the corporate income tax rate 

during the first quarter of 2018 the company recorded an additional charge of 06 million  to adjust an accrual related to withholding taxes on planned repatriations during the second quarter of 2018 the company paid the first installment of the “toll charge” during the third quarter of 2018 the company recorded a benefit of 80 million  to adjust the provisional “toll charge” required from the transition to the new territorial tax system and a benefit of 02 million  to adjust the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets as a result of us tax reform during the fourth quarter the company completed its final assessment under sab 118 and recorded an additional charge of 328 million  to adjust an accrual related to the us state impact and foreign withholding taxes on planned repatriations the charge in the fourth quarter of 2018 is consistent with the companys need to repatriate funds for debt repayment purposes

sales performance by segment was as follows 



 

 taste 

taste sales in 2017 increased 9 on a reported basis and 10 on a currency neutral basis versus the prior year period acquisitions accounted for approximately 5 of the net sales growth on both a reported and currency neutral basis overall growth was primarily driven by new win performance net of losses and the impact of acquisitions partially offset by decreases in volume globally taste growth included mid singledigit growth in emerging markets overall emerging markets represented approximately 49 of total taste sales

  45 

principally related to a litigation accrual of 485 million acquisition related costs of 45 million and severance costs related to the termination of a former executive officer of 14 million in 2016 during 2017 costs were higher as a result of recently acquired companies offset by slightly lower legal and professional fees associated with various finance initiatives and decreases in legal and patent fees

restructuring and other charges primarily consist of separation costs for employees including severance outplacement and other benefit costs   



amortization of acquisitionrelated intangibles 

amortization expenses increased to 347 million in 2017 compared to 238 million in 2016 the increase of 109 million is principally due to the acquisitions of fragrance resources and powderpure in 2017 as well as recognizing a full year of amortization in 2017 from the acquisition of david michael as compared to 2016 

operating results by business unit 

we evaluate the performance of business units based on segment profit which is defined as operating profit before restructuring and certain nonrecurring items interest expense other expense net and taxes on income see note 15  to our consolidated financial statements for the reconciliation to income before taxes   



taste business unit 

taste segment profit increased 303 million  to 3605 million  in 2017  221  of segment sales from 3302 million   221  of sales in the comparable 2016 period the increase in segment profit and profit margin principally reflected productivity initiatives and solid topline growth 

  46 

scent business unit 

scent segment profit decreased 78 million  to 3190 million  in 2017  181  of segment sales compared to 3267 million   202  of sales reported in 2016 the decrease in segment profit and profit margin was principally driven by the impact of acquisitions and unfavorable price versus input costs partially offset by volume growth and the benefits from cost and productivity initiatives 

global expenses 

global expenses represent corporate and headquarterrelated expenses which include legal finance human resources and rd and other administrative expenses that are not allocated to an individual business unit in 2017 global expenses were 608 million  compared to 484 million  during 2016 the increase was principally driven by lower gains on our cash flow hedging program and higher incentive compensation costs 

interest expense 

in 2017 interest expense increased 124 million  to 654 million  compared to 530 million  in 2016 reflecting the impact of our issuance of senior notes  2017 in the second quarter of 2017 average cost of debt was 41 for the 2017 period compared to 38 in 2016 

other income expense net 

other income net increased approximately 260 million  to 498 million  of income in 2017 versus 238 million  of income in 2016 the increase was largely driven by gains on foreign currency of approximately 13 million in the current year versus approximately 5 million in the prior year as well as proceeds from certain life insurance policies of approximately 4 million in 2017 

income taxes 

the effective tax rate was 449  in 2017 as compared to 227  in 2016 excluding 1392 million related to the us tax reform legal chargescredits net of 04 million acquisition related costs of 65 million gain on sale of assets of 01 million operational improvement initiative costs of 05 million restructuring and other charges net of 55 million fda mandated product recall costs of 39 million uk pension settlement charge of 05 million tax assessment of 19 million and integration related costs of 13 million the adjusted effective tax rate for 2017 was 207  for 2016 the adjusted tax rate was 238  excluding 171 million 41 million 06 million and 01 million of tax benefits associated with pretax legal chargescredits acquisitionrelated costs operational improvement initiatives and restructuring related costs respectively as well as a 27 million tax charge related to the gain on sale of property the yearoveryear reduction principally reflects the reversal of certain valuation allowances on us state deferred taxes 

us tax reform 

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” that significantly revised the us tax code effective january 1 2018 by among other things lowering the corporate income tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35 to a flat 21 limiting deductibility of interest expense and performance based incentive compensation transitioning to a territorial system and creating new taxes associated with global operations 

the tax act impacted our consolidated results of operations during the 2017 fourth quarter and is expected to continue to impact our consolidated results of operations in future periods in particular the transition to the new territorial tax system required us to record a onetime tax or “toll charge” which resulted in a provisional incremental tax expense of 1006 million principally related to previously unremitted earnings on nonus subsidiaries the cash portion of the toll charge will be payable in installments over 8 years beginning in 2018 in addition the reduction of the us corporate tax rate resulted in a provisional net deferred tax expense of 386 million related to the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets as a result of the reduction in the corporate income tax rate given the significant complexity of the tax act anticipated guidance from the us treasury about implementing the tax act and the potential for additional guidance from the sec or the fasb the company’s provisional charge may be adjusted during 2018 and is expected to be finalized no later than the fourth quarter of 2018 other provisions of the tax act that impact future tax years are still being assessed any material revisions in the companys computations could adversely affect its cash flows and results of operations 

based on our current assessment and understanding of the tax act and the company’s current global operating structure the company believes its effective tax rate will be approximately 21 in 2018 the impact of the tax act may differ from this estimate due to among other things changes in interpretations and assumptions the company has made additional 

  47 

guidance that may be issued by the taxing authorities as well as operating andor structural changes that the company may take as a result of the tax act 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash and cash equivalents 

we had cash and cash equivalents of 6349 million  at december 31 2018  compared to 3680 million  at december 31 2017  of which 4346 million of the balance at december 31 2018  was held outside the united states cash balances held in foreign jurisdictions are in most circumstances available to be repatriated to the united states 

effective utilization of the cash generated by our international operations is a critical component of our strategy we regularly repatriate cash from our nonus subsidiaries to fund financial obligations in the us these repatriations totaled 1551 million 1922 million and 1345 million in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively the tax act includes a mandatory onetime tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of december 31 2017 and as a result all previously unremitted earnings for which no us deferred tax liability had been accrued were subject to us tax and will not be subject to additional us federal tax when repatriated however such distributions could be subject to foreign withholding or other taxes including state taxes we have repatriated 1551 million during 2018 and anticipate repatriating amounts in the future to provide for the cash needs of our us operations and to repay debt we anticipate the relevant foreign withholding and other taxes including state taxes to be approximately 888 million and have recorded the deferred tax liabilities accordingly 

restricted cash 

as discussed in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements restricted cash of 136 million  relates to amounts escrowed related to certain payments to be made to former frutarom option holders in future periods 

cash flows from operating activities 

operating cash flows in 2018  were 4376 million  compared to 3908 million  in 2017  and 5501 million  in 2016  the increase in operating cash flows from 2017 to 2018 was principally driven by lower litigation settlement and pension payments and higher net income offset by higher net working capital principally related to inventories the decrease in operating cash flows in 2017 as compared to 2016 was principally related to the impact of increased core working capital requirements trade receivables inventories and accounts payable and due to payments on legal claims along with severance integration and acquisition costs 

working capital current assets less current liabilities totaled 181 billion  at yearend 2018  compared to 113 billion  at december 31 2017  this increase in working capital of 6858 million  primarily reflected increases in accounts receivable and inventory offset by increases in accounts payable and other current liabilities as compared to the prior year 

we sold certain accounts receivable on a nonrecourse basis to unrelated financial institutions under “factoring” agreements that are sponsored solely and individually by certain customers we believe that participating in the factoring programs strengthens our relationships with these customers and provides operational efficiencies we estimate that as a result of participating in the programs the beneficial impact on cash provided by operations decreased approximately 169 million  in 2018  compared to an increase of approximately 76 million  and 34 million  in 2017  and 2016  respectively the cost of participating in these programs was immaterial to our results in all periods 

cash flows used in investing activities 

net investing activities in 2018  utilized 50 billion  compared to 2999 million  and 3555 million  in 2017  and 2016  respectively the increase in cash paid for investing activities was primarily driven by higher payments for acquisitions in 2018 we acquired frutarom for approximately 7 billion  net of cash acquired of which 49 billion was paid in cash in 2017 we acquired fragrance resources and powderpure for approximately 1375 million  net of cash acquired and 542 million  net of cash acquired respectively in addition to a purchase price adjustment of 07 million related to david michael in 2017 

additions to property plant and equipment were 1701 million  1290 million  and 1264 million  in 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively net of grants and other reimbursements from government authorities these investments largely arise from our ongoing focus to align our manufacturing facilities with customer demand primarily in emerging markets and new technology consistent with our strategy 

in light of our requirement to begin relocating one of our fragrance ingredients facilities in china the ongoing construction of new facilities in india and indonesia and capital requirements to integrate our recently acquired frutarom 

  48 

business we expect that capital spending in 2019  will be about 5 6  of sales net of potential grants and other reimbursements from government authorities   

cash flows provided by financing activities 

net cash provided by financing activities in 2018  increased to 48707 million  compared to cash used in financing activities of 426 million  and 344 million  in 2017  and 2016  respectively the increase in 2018 versus 2017 was principally driven by frutarom related financing activities where we issued 33 billion  of debt including €11 billion aggregate principal amount of the 2018 euro senior notes 15 billion aggregate principal amount of the 2018 usd senior notes 1395 million aggregate principal amount of the amortizing note portion of the teus and 350 million aggregate principal amount of the term loan as compared to 4939 million  of 2047 notes issued in 2017 we also issued 23 billion  of equity in the third quarter of 2018 to finance the frutarom acquisition including 16 billion  of our common stock and 6855 million  of the stock purchase contract portion spc of the teus additionally we repaid 2888 million of our senior notes  2007 including the loss on extinguishment of debt of 388 million 

at december 31 2018  we had 45531 million  of debt outstanding compared to 16392 million  outstanding at december 31 2017  

we paid dividends totaling 2302 million  2061 million  and 1849 million  in 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively the cash dividend declared per share in 2018  2017  and 2016  was 284  266  and 240  respectively 

our capital allocation strategy is primarily focused on debt repayment to maintain our investment grade rating we will also prioritize capital investment in our businesses to support the strategic long term plans the company is also committed to maintaining its history of paying a dividend to investors determined by our board of directors “board” at its discretion based on various factors and finally will be very selective in pursuing value creating strategic ma over the near term 

in december 2012 the board of directors authorized a 2500 million  share repurchase program which commenced in the first quarter of 2013 in august 2015 the board of directors approved an additional 250 million share repurchase authorization and extension through december 31 2017 based on the total remaining amount of 2797 million  available under the amended repurchase program as of october 31 2017 the board of directors reapproved on november 1 2017 a 2500 million  share repurchase authorization and extension for a total value of 3000 million available under the program which expires on november 1 2022  based on the total remaining amount of 280 million  available under the repurchase program approximately 21 million  shares or 19  of shares outstanding based on the market price and shares outstanding as of december 31 2018  could be repurchased under the program as of december 31 2018  on may 7 2018 we announced that we were suspending our share repurchases until our deleveraging target is met following our acquisition of frutarom 

capital resources 

operating cash flow provides the primary source of funds for capital investment needs dividends paid to shareholders and debt service repayments we anticipate that cash flows from operations and availability under our existing credit facilities will sufficient to meet our investing and financing needs we regularly assess our capital structure including both current and longterm debt instruments as compared to our cash generation and investment needs in order to provide ample flexibility and to optimize our leverage ratios we believe our existing cash balances are sufficient to meet our debt service requirements 

as discussed above and in note 10  to the consolidated financial statements in connection with our acquisition of frutarom we repaid the 250 million  outstanding principal amount of the senior notes  2007 plus accrued and unpaid interest of 77 million  and a make whole payment of 349 million  and 39 million  realized loss on the termination of a fair value hedge in addition to 695 million  of frutaroms net debt concurrent with the closing of the transaction in the next three years we expect to reduce our net debt by repaying our outstanding liabilities upon maturity using the proceeds from operating cashflows and from the suspension of our share repurchase program 

during the fourth quarter of 2018 we acquired frutarom for approximately 7 billion   net of cash acquired the cash portion of the consideration was approximately 5 billion which was funded from the proceeds from issuing 3 billion  in net new debt issuing 23 billion  in equity we also issued of treasury shares worth 21 billion

on june 6 2018 the company entered into a term loan credit agreement to replace a portion of the bridge loan facility reducing the amount of the bridge loan commitments by 350 million  under the term loan credit agreement the lenders thereunder committed to provide subject to certain conditions a senior unsecured term loan facility as amended term loan in an original aggregate principal amount of up to 3500 million  maturing three  years after the funding date thereunder the proceeds from the term loan were received on october 3 2018 

the term loan bears interest at the company’s option at a per annum rate equal to either x an adjusted libor rate plus an applicable margin varying from 075  to 200  or y a base rate plus an applicable margin varying from 000  to 100  in each case depending on the public debt ratings for noncredit enhanced longterm senior unsecured debt issued by the company loans under the term loan will amortize quarterly at a per annum rate of 100  of the aggregate principal amount of the loans made under the term loan on the funding date commencing december 31 2018 with the balance payable on october 3 2021 the company may voluntarily prepay the term loans without premium or penalty 

the amended credit facility and term loan contain various covenants limitations and events of default customary for similar facilities for similarly rated borrowers including the requirement for us to maintain at the end of each fiscal quarter a ratio of net debt for borrowed money to adjusted ebitda in respect of the previous 12month period including the pro forma effect of the acquisition of frutarom of not more than 45 to 10 which shall be reduced to 425 to 10 as of the end of september 30 2019 40 to 10 as of the end of march 31 2020 and to 35 to 10 as of the end of march 31 2021 

as of december 31 2018  we had no of borrowings under our amended credit facility but 350 million  outstanding for the term loan the amount which we are able to draw down on under the amended credit facility is limited by financial covenants as described in more detail below as of december 31 2018  our draw down capacity was 1 billion  on the amended credit facility and 350 million  on the term loan see note 10  to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the credit facility and loan 

  50 

at december 31 2018  and 2017  we were in compliance with all financial and other covenants including the net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio at december 31 2018  our net debtadjusted ebitda 1 ratio was 356  to 1 as defined by the credit facility agreements well below the financial covenants of existing outstanding debt failure to comply with the financial and other covenants under our debt agreements would constitute default and would allow the lenders to accelerate the maturity of all indebtedness under the related agreement if such acceleration were to occur we would not have sufficient liquidity available to repay the indebtedness we would likely have to seek amendments under the agreements for relief from the financial covenants or repay the debt with proceeds from the issuance of new debt or equity andor asset sales if necessary we may be unable to amend the agreements or raise sufficient capital to repay such obligations in the event the maturities are accelerated

tangible equity units  senior unsecured amortizing notes 

on september 17 2018 in connection with the issuance of the teus the company issued 1395 million  aggregate principal amount of amortizing notes the amortizing notes mature on september 15 2021 each quarterly cash installment payment of 075  or in the case of the installment payment due on december 15 2018 073333  per amortizing note will constitute a partial repayment of principal and a payment of interest computed at an annual rate of 379  interest will be calculated on the basis of a 360 day year consisting of twelve 30 day months payments will be applied first to the interest due and payable and then to the reduction of the unpaid principal amount allocated as set forth in the amortization schedule in the indenture governing the amortizing notes see note 9  for further information on the teus 

there are no covenants or provisions in the indenture related to the teus that would afford the holders of the amortizing notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction reorganization restructuring merger or similar transaction involving the company that may adversely affect such holders if a fundamental change occurs or if the company elects to settle the spcs early then the holders of the amortizing notes will have the right to require the company to repurchase the amortizing notes at a repurchase price equal to the principal amount of the amortizing notes as of the repurchase date plus accrued and unpaid interest the indenture also contains customary events of default which would permit the holders of the amortizing notes to declare the notes to be immediately due and payable if not cured within applicable grace periods including the failure to make timely installment payments on the notes or other material indebtedness failure to give notice of a fundamental change and specified events of bankruptcy and insolvency 

other commitments 

compliance with existing governmental requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment has not materially affected our operations earnings or competitive position in 2018  and 2017  we spent 62 million and 279 million on capital projects and 217 million and 175 million respectively in operating expenses and governmental charges for the purpose of complying with such regulations expenditures for these purposes will continue for the foreseeable future in addition we are party to a number of proceedings brought under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act or similar state statutes it is expected that the impact of any judgments in or voluntary settlements of such proceedings will not be material to our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

contractual obligations 

at december 31 2018  we had contractual payment obligations due within the time periods as specified in the following table   



 



  53 

 the table above does not include 489 million  of the total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions and approximately 3 million  of associated accrued interest and 888 million associated with the deferred tax liability on deemed repatriation due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential cash flows we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the amount and period in which the remaining liabilities might be paid 

critical accounting policies and use of estimates 

our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1  to the consolidated financial statements as disclosed in note 1  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and accompanying disclosures these estimates are based on management’s best judgment of current events and actions that we may undertake in the future actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates 

those areas requiring the greatest degree of management judgment or deemed most critical to our financial reporting involve 

business combinations   from time to time we enter into strategic acquisitions in an effort to better service existing customers and to attain new customers when we acquire a controlling financial interest in an entity or group of assets that are determined to meet the definition of a business we apply the acquisition method described in asc topic 805 business combinations in accordance with gaap the results of the acquisitions we have completed are reflected in our financial statements from the date of acquisition forward 

we allocate the purchase consideration paid to acquire the business to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values at the acquisition date with the excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill if during the measurement period a period not to exceed twelve months from the acquisition date we receive additional information that existed as of the acquisition date but at the time of the original allocation described above was unknown to us we make the appropriate adjustments to the purchase price allocation in the reporting period the amounts are determined 

significant judgment is required to estimate the intangibles and fair value of fixed assets and in assigning their respective useful lives accordingly we typically engage thirdparty valuation specialists who work under the direction of management to assist in valuing significant tangible and intangible assets acquired 

the fair value estimates are based on available historical information future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management but are inherently uncertain 

we typically use an income method to estimate the fair value of intangible assets which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants and include the amount and timing of future cash flows including expected growth rates discount rate and profitability royalty rates used in the relief of royalty method customer attrition rates product obsolescence factors a brand’s relative market position and the discount rate applied to the cash flows unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions 

determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires significant judgment all of our acquired intangible assets eg trademarks product formulas noncompete agreements and customer relationships are expected to have finite useful lives our estimates of the useful lives of finitelived intangible assets are based on a number of factors including competitive environment market share brand history operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the regions in which the brands are sold 

the costs of finitelived intangible assets are amortized through expense over their estimated lives the value of residual goodwill is not amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment as described in the following note for acquired intangible assets the remaining useful life of the trade names and trademarks product formulas and customer relationships was estimated at the point at which substantially all of the present value of cumulative cash flows have been earned 

the periodic assessment of potential impairment of goodwill  we currently have goodwill of 54 billion  of which 42 billion  relates to our acquisition of frutarom and is subject to change upon completion of our allocation of the consideration transferred to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from frutarom the allocation of goodwill among reporting units has not yet been completed but will be completed within one year from the frutarom acquisition date october 4 2018 

  54 

in assessing the potential for impairment of goodwill management uses the most current actual and forecasted operating data available and current marketbased assumptions in accordance with the criteria in financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc 350 the company has identified five reporting units 1 flavor compounds 2 fragrance compounds 3 fragrance ingredients 4 cosmetic actives ingredients and 5 frutarom these reporting units were determined based on the level at which the performance is measured and reviewed by segment management in the case of frutarom the reporting unit determination is preliminary and is subject to change 

the company performs an annual goodwill impairment test for its reporting units by assessing the fair value of the reporting units based on discounted cash flows if a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value the company will record an impairment charge based on that difference and the impairment charge will be limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit the company completed its annual goodwill impairment test as of november 30   2018  which indicated no impairment of goodwill as the estimated fair values substantially exceeded the carrying values of each of these reporting units except for the recently acquired frutarom reporting unit for which the fair value is expected to approximate the carrying value 

the periodic assessment of potential impairment of finitelived intangible assets  the company reviews longlived assets for impairment when events or changes in business conditions indicate that their full carrying value may not be recovered an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by an asset or group of assets is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists if assets are determined to be impaired the loss is measured based on an estimate of fair value using various valuation techniques including a discounted estimate of future cash flows 

the analysis and evaluation of income taxes  we account for taxes under the asset and liability method under this method deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax return bases of assets and liabilities a valuation allowance is recognized if based on the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized the assessment of the need for a valuation allowance requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future earnings reversal of existing temporary differences and available tax planning strategies if actual experience differs from these estimates and assumptions the recorded deferred tax asset may not be fully realized resulting in an increase to income tax expense in our results of operations 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes we first determine whether it is “more likely than not” that we would sustain our tax position if the relevant tax authority were to audit the position with full knowledge of all the relevant facts and other information for those tax positions that meet this threshold we measure the amount of tax benefit based on the largest amount of tax benefit that we have a greater than 50 chance of realizing in a final settlement with the relevant authority those tax positions failing to qualify for initial recognition are recognized in the first interim period in which they meet the more likely than not standard this evaluation is made at the time that we adopt a tax position and whenever there is new information and is based upon management’s evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date we maintain a cumulative risk portfolio relating to all of our uncertainties in income taxes in order to perform this analysis but the evaluation of our tax positions requires significant judgment and estimation in part because in certain cases tax law is subject to varied interpretation and whether a tax position will ultimately be sustained may be uncertain we do not currently believe that any of our pending tax assessments even if ultimately resolved against us would have a material impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” that significantly revised the us tax code effective january 1 2018 by among other things lowering the corporate income tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35  to a flat 21  limiting deductibility of interest expense and performance based incentive compensation transitioning to a territorial system and creating new taxes associated with global operations 

the tax act impacted our consolidated results of operations during the 2017 fourth quarter in particular the transition to the new territorial tax system required us to record a onetime tax or “toll charge” which resulted in a provisional incremental tax expense of 1006 million  principally related to previously unremitted earnings on nonus subsidiaries the cash portion of the toll charge is payable in installments over 8  years beginning in 2018 in addition the reduction of the us corporate tax rate resulted in a provisional net deferred tax expense of 386 million  related to the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets as a result of the reduction in the corporate income tax rate 

during the first quarter of 2018 the company recorded an additional charge of 06 million to adjust an accrual related to withholding taxes on planned repatriations during the second quarter of 2018 the company paid the first installment of the “toll charge” during the third quarter of 2018 the company recorded a benefit of 80 million to adjust the provisional “toll charge” required from the transition to the new territorial tax system and a benefit of 02 million to adjust the remeasurement 

  55 

of net deferred tax assets as a result of us tax reform during the fourth quarter the company recorded an additional charge of 328 million to adjust an accrual related to the us state impact and foreign withholding taxes on planned repatriations and completed its assessment under sab 118 with no further material change to the amounts previously recorded 

the tax act created significant international tax provisions including a new category of income global intangible lowtaxed income gilti the company has elected to treat gilti as a current period cost if and when incurred this tax position resulted in an 82 million income tax expense for the year ended december 31 2018 

the evaluation of potential litigation and environmental liabilities where changing circumstances rules and regulations require regular reassessment of related practices and anticipated costs  we are subject to certain legal claims regarding products and other matters as well as environmentalrelated matters significant management judgment is involved in determining when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the extent to which it can be reasonably estimated 

we regularly assess potential liabilities with respect to all legal claims based on the most recent available information in consultation with outside counsel we have engaged on our behalf to handle the defense of such matters to the extent a liability is considered to be probable and reasonably estimable we recognize a corresponding liability if the reasonably estimated liability is a range we recognize that amount considered most likely or in the absence of such a determination the minimum reasonably estimated liability to the extent such claims are covered by various insurance policies we separately evaluate the right to recovery and estimate the related insurance claim receivable management judgments involve determination as to whether a liability has been incurred the reasonably estimated amount of that liability and any potential insurance recovery 

we regularly evaluate potential environmental exposure in terms of total estimated cost and the viability of other potentially responsible parties “prp’s” associated with our exposure recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress and additional information becomes available critical management assumptions relate to expected total costs to remediate and the financial viability of prp’s to share such costs 

determination of the various assumptions employed in the valuation of pension and retiree health care expense and associated obligations  amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined from actuarial valuations inherent in such valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets discount rates at which the liabilities could be settled rates of increase in future compensation levels mortality rates and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in note 16  to the consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore affect expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods 

we consider a number of factors in determining and selecting assumptions for the overall expected longterm rate of return on plan assets we consider the historical longterm return experience of our assets the current and expected allocation of our plan assets and expected longterm rates of return we derive these expected longterm rates of return with the assistance of our investment advisors we base our expected allocation of plan assets on a diversified portfolio consisting of domestic and international equity securities fixed income real estate and alternative asset classes 

we consider a variety of factors in determining and selecting our assumptions for the discount rate at december 31 for the us plans the discount rate was based on the internal rate of return for a portfolio of high quality bonds rated aa or higher by either moody’s or standard  poors with maturities that are consistent with the projected future benefit payment obligations of the plan for the nonus plans the discount rates were determined by region and are based on high quality longterm corporate bonds consideration has been given to the duration of the liabilities in each plan when selecting the bonds to be used in determining the discount rate the rate of compensation increase for all plans and the medical cost trend rate for the applicable us plans are based on plan experience 

with respect to the us plans the expected rate of return on plan assets was determined based on an asset allocation model using the current target allocation real rates of return by asset class and an anticipated inflation rate the target asset allocation consists of approximately 20  in equity securities and 80  in fixed income securities the plan has achieved a compounded annual rate of return of 49 over the previous 20 years at december 31 2018  the actual asset allocation for the us plan was 1  cash and cash equivalents 25  in equity securities and 74  in fixed income securities 

the expected rate of return for the nonus plans employs a similar set of criteria adapted for local investments inflation rates and in certain cases specific government requirements the target asset allocation for the nonus plans consists of approximately 40  – 70  in fixed income securities 15  – 40  in equity securities 5  – 20  in real estate and 5  – 10  in alternative investments at december 31 2018  the actual asset allocation for the nonus plan was 36  in fixed income investments 12  in equity investments 8  in real estate investments 3  in cash and cash equivalents and 41  in alternative investments 

  56 

changes in pension and other postemployment benefits and associated expenses may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions the impact that a 025 decrease in the discount rate or a 1 change in the medical cost trend rate would have on our pension and other postemployment benefit expense as applicable is as follows 



the effect of a 1 increase in the medical cost trend rate would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and the annual postretirement expense by approximately 03 million  and less than   01 million  respectively a 1 decrease in the rate would decrease the obligation and expense by approximately   03 million  and less than   01 million  respectively 

the ongoing assessment of the valuation of inventory given the large number of natural ingredients employed the quality of which may be diminished over time  we hold a majority of our inventory as raw materials providing the greatest degree of flexibility in manufacture and use as of december 31 2018  we maintained 53  of our inventory as raw materials materials are evaluated based on shelf life known uses and anticipated demand based on forecasted customer order activity and changes in productsales mix management policy provides for an ongoing assessment of inventory with adjustments recorded when an item is deemed to be slow moving or obsolete 

redeemable noncontrolling interest  through some of our subsidiaries we assume certain noncontrolling interests that carry redemption features noncontrolling interests where we may be required to repurchase the noncontrolling interest under a put option or other contractual redemption requirement are reported in the consolidated balance sheet between liabilities and equity as redeemable noncontrolling interest we adjust the redeemable noncontrolling interests when the redemption value exceeds the carrying value with changes recognized as an adjustment to additional paidin capital 

overall we believe that we have considered relevant circumstances that we may be currently subject to and the financial statements accurately reflect our best estimate of the impact of these items in our results of operations financial condition and cash flows for the years presented we have discussed the decision process and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers with subsequent amendments that provides for a comprehensive model to be used in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers asc topic 606 revenue from contracts with customers the “revenue standard” under the revenue standard revenue is recognized to reflect the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services companies have the option to apply the new guidance under a retrospective approach to each prior reporting period presented or a modified retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially applying the new guidance recognized at the date of initial application within the consolidated balance sheet the new revenue standard became effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 and we have adopted the new revenue standard using the modified retrospective approach on december 30 2017 the first day of our 2018 fiscal year 

we create and manufacture flavors and fragrances approximately 90 of our products principally flavor compounds and fragrance compounds are customized to customer specifications and have no alternative use other than the sale to the specific customer “compounds products” the remaining revenue is derived largely from ingredients products that generally are commodity products with alternative uses and not customized “ingredients products” 

with respect to the vast majority of our contracts for compounds products we currently recognize revenue on the transfer of control of the product at a point in time as we do not have an “enforceable right to payment for performance to 

  57 

date” as set out in the revenue standard with respect to a small number of contracts for the sale of compounds we have an “enforceable right to payment for performance to date” and as the products do not have an alternative use we recognize revenue for these contracts over time and record a contract asset using the output method the output method recognizes revenue on the basis of direct measurements of the value to the customer of the goods or services transferred to date relative to the remaining goods or services promised under the contract 

with respect to our contracts related to ingredients products we currently recognize revenue on the transfer of control of the product at a point in time as such products generally have alternative uses and we do not have an “enforceable right to payment for performance to date” 

as we adopted the revenue standard using the modified retrospective method effective the first day of its 2018 fiscal year results for our 2018 fiscal year are presented under the revenue standard while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting under asc topic 605 which required that revenue was accounted for when the earnings process was complete 

we recorded a net increase to retained earnings of 21 million  as of the first day of its 2018 fiscal year due to the cumulative impact of adopting the revenue standard in connection with the adjustment to retained earnings we also recorded an increase of 44 million  in contract assets which are included in prepaid expenses and other assets a decrease of 17 million  in inventory and an increase in taxes payable of 06 million  

 the impact to revenues gross profit and net income for the twelve months ended december 31 2018 were reductions of 40 million  26 million  and 19 million  respectively as a result of applying the revenue standard as compared to the amounts that would have been recognized under asc topic 605 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue when control of the promised goods is transferred to its customers in an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods sales value add and other taxes we collect are excluded from revenues we receive payment in accordance with standard customer terms 

the following table presents our revenues disaggregated by product categories 



 

 the following table presents our revenues disaggregated by region based on the region of our customers

flavor and fragrance compounds revenues 

we account for a contract when it has approval and commitment from both parties the rights of the parties and payment terms which vary by customer are identified the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable consistent with our past practice the amount of revenue recognized is adjusted at the time of sale for expected discounts and rebates “variable consideration” 

we generate revenues primarily by manufacturing customized taste and scent compounds for the exclusive use of our customers we combine the shipment of goods with their manufacture to account for both shipment and manufacture as the sole performance obligation 

with respect to the vast majority of our contracts for compounds products we recognize a sale at the point in time when it ships the product from its manufacturing facility to its customer as this is the time when control of the goods has transferred to the customer the amount of consideration received and revenue recognized is impacted by the variable consideration the company has agreed with its customers we estimate variable consideration amounts for each customer based on the specific agreement an analysis of historical volumes and the current activity with that customer we reassess our estimates of variable consideration at each reporting date throughout the contract period and updates the estimate until the uncertainty is resolved during the current period changes to estimates of variable consideration have been immaterial 

with respect to a small number of contracts for the sale of compounds products we recognize revenue over time as it manufactures customized compounds that do not have an alternative use and for which the contracts provide us with an enforceable right to payment including a reasonable profit at all times during the contract term commencing with the manufacturing of the goods when revenue is recognized over time the amount of revenue recognized is based on the extent of progress towards completion of the promised goods we generally use the output method to measure progress for its contracts as this method reflects the transfer of goods to the customer once customization begins the manufacturing process is generally completed within a two week period due to the short time frame for production there is little estimation uncertainty in the process in addition due to the customized nature of our products our returns are not material 

ingredients revenues 

we account for a contract when it has approval and commitment from both parties the rights of the parties and payment terms which vary by customer are identified the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable 

we generate revenues primarily by manufacturing ingredients products for the use of our customers we combine the shipment of goods with their manufacture to account for both shipment and manufacture as the sole performance obligation 

generally we recognize a sale at the time when it ships the product from their manufacturing facility to their customer as this is the point when control of the goods or services has transferred to the customer the amount of consideration received and revenue recognized is impacted by discounts offered to its customers we estimate discounts based on an analysis of historical experience and current activity we assess our estimates of discounts at each reporting date throughout the contract period and updates its estimates until the uncertainty has been resolved during the current period changes to estimates of discounts have been immaterial

nongaap financial measures 

we use nongaap financial operating measures in this form 10k including i currency neutral sales which eliminates the effects that result from translating its international sales in us dollars ii adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross margin which exclude operational improvement initiatives acquisition related costs integration related costs fda mandated product recall and frutarom acquisition related costs  iii adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating margin which excludes operational improvement initiatives acquisition related costs integration related costs legal chargescredits net tax assessment restructuring and other charges net gain on sale of assets fda mandated product recall uk pension settlement charges and frutarom acquisition related costs  and iv adjusted selling and administrative expenses which excludes acquisition related costs integration related costs legal chargescredits net tax assessment uk pension settlement charges and frutarom acquisition related costs  and v adjusted effective tax rate which excludes operational improvement initiatives acquisition related costs integration related costs legal chargescredits net tax assessment restructuring and other charges net cta realization fda mandated product recall uk pension settlement charges us tax reform and frutarom acquisition related costs  we also provide the nongaap measures adjusted ebitda which excludes certain specified items and noncash items as set forth in the company’s debt agreements and net debt which is adjusted for deferred gain on interest rate swaps and cash and cash equivalents solely for the purpose of providing information on the extent to which the company is in compliance with debt covenants contained in its debt agreements 

in addition the frutarom acquisition related costs have been separated from costs related to prior acquisitions the frutarom acquisition costs represent a significant balance and we believe this amount should be shown separately to provide an accurate presentation of the acquisition related costs our gaap results and gaap metrics do not change and this change has no effect on day to day business operations or how we manage our business 

we have included each of these nongaap measures in order to provide additional information regarding our underlying operating results and comparable yearoveryear performance such information is supplemental to information presented in accordance with gaap and is not intended to represent a presentation in accordance with gaap in discussing our historical and expected future results and financial condition we believe it is meaningful for investors to be made aware of and to be assisted in a better understanding of on a periodtoperiod comparable basis financial amounts both including and excluding these identified items as well as the impact of exchange rate fluctuations we believe such additional nongaap information provides investors with an overall perspective of the periodtoperiod performance of our business in addition management internally reviews each of these nongaap measures to evaluate performance on a comparative periodtoperiod basis in terms of absolute performance trends and expected future performance with respect to our business a material limitation of these nongaap measures is that such measures do not reflect actual gaap amounts we compensate for such limitations by using these measures as one of several metrics including gaap measures these nongaap measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we operate on a global basis and are exposed to currency fluctuation related to the manufacture and sale of our products in currencies other than the us dollar the major foreign currencies involve the markets in the european union great britain mexico brazil china india indonesia australia and japan although all regions are subject to foreign currency fluctuations versus the us dollar we actively monitor our foreign currency exposures in all major markets in which we operate and employ a variety of techniques to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations including foreign currency hedging activities 

we have established a centralized reporting system to evaluate the effects of changes in interest rates currency exchange rates and other relevant market risks our risk management procedures include the monitoring of interest rate and foreign exchange exposures and hedge positions utilizing statistical analyses of cash flows market value and sensitivity analysis however the use of these techniques to quantify the market risk of such instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of their accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions for the year ended december 31 2018  the company’s exposure to market risk was estimated using sensitivity analyses which illustrate the change in the fair value of a derivative financial instrument assuming hypothetical changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts with the objective of reducing exposure to cash flow volatility associated with foreign currency receivables and payables and with anticipated purchases of certain raw materials used in operations these contracts the counterparties to which are major international financial institutions generally involve the exchange of one currency for a second currency at a future date and have maturities not exceeding twelve months the gain or loss on the hedging instrument and services is recorded in earnings at the same time as the transaction being hedged is recorded in earnings at december 31 2018  the company’s foreign currency exposures pertaining to derivative contracts exist with the euro japanese yen british pound australian dollar and indonesian rupiah based on a hypothetical decrease or increase of 10 in the applicable balance sheet exchange rates primarily against the us dollar the estimated fair value of the company’s foreign currency forward contracts would increase or decrease by approximately 60 million however any change in the value of the contracts real or hypothetical would be significantly offset by a corresponding change in the value of the underlying hedged items 

we use derivative instruments as part of our interest rate risk management strategy we have entered into certain cross currency swap agreements in order to mitigate a portion of our net european investments from foreign currency risk as of december 31 2018 these swaps were in a net asset position with an aggregate fair value of 109 million  based on a hypothetical decrease or increase of 10 in the value of the us dollar against the euro the estimated fair value of the company’s cross currency swaps would change by approximately 60 million 

at december 31 2018  the fair value of our eur fixed rate debt was €162 billion  based on a hypothetical increase of 10 in foreign exchange rates the estimated fair value of the company’s eur fixed debt would increase by 200 million 

at december 31 2018  the fair value of our usd fixed rate debt was 235 billion  based on a hypothetical increase of 10 in interest rates the estimated fair value of the company’s us fixed debt would decrease by 84 million 

we purchase certain commodities such as natural gas electricity petroleum based products and certain crop related items we generally purchase these commodities based upon market prices that are established with the vendor as part of the purchase process in general we do not use commodity financial instruments to hedge commodity prices

vision 2020 strategy 

we continued to execute against the four pillars of our vision 2020 strategy originally announced in 2015 and refreshed in 2017 which focuses on building differentiation and accelerating growth to create shareholder value 

 our product offerings 

flavors 

flavors are the key building blocks that impart taste experiences in food and beverage products and as such play a significant role in determining consumer preference for the end products in which they are used as a leading creator of flavor compounds we help our customers deliver on the promise of delicious and healthy foods and drinks that appeal to consumers while we are a global leader our flavors business is more regional in nature with different formulas that reflect local taste preferences we create our flavors in our regional creative centers which allow us to satisfy local taste preferences while also helping to ensure regulatory compliance and production standards we develop thousands of different flavors and taste offerings for our customers most of which are tailormade we continually develop new formulas in order to meet changing consumer preferences and customer needs 

our flavors compounds are ultimately used by our customers in the following four enduse categories of consumer goods 1 savory for use in soups sauces condiments prepared meals meat and poultry potato chips and other savory snacks 2 beverages for use in juice drinks carbonated beverages flavored waters and spirits 3 sweet for use in bakery products candy chewing gum and cereal and 4 dairy for use in all dairy products such as yogurt ice cream and cheese and other products that have a creamy flavor 

  4 

we continue to build upon our strengths and to focus on addressing industry trends that will allow us to differentiate ourselves from our competitors and deliver accelerated growth consistent with our vision 2020 strategy these trends include 

 fragrances 

our fragrances business derives revenue from two sources fragrance compounds and ingredients 

we are a global leader in the creation of fragrance compounds that are integral elements in the world’s finest perfumes and bestknown consumer products within fabric care home care personal wash hair care and toiletries our fragrance ingredients business is a vertically integrated operation originating with the development in our research laboratories of naturals synthetic and proprietary molecules and innovative delivery systems progressing to our manufacturing facilities that produce these ingredients in a consistent highquality and costeffective manner and transitioning to our creative centers and application laboratories where our perfumers partner with our customers to create unique fragrance compounds for use in a variety of enduse products we also produce cosmetic active and functional ingredients for use in cosmetics 

by providing our fragrance development teams with an extensive portfolio of innovative highquality and effective ingredients to support their creativity we are able to provide our customers with a unique identity for their brands these ingredients or fragrance compounds can then be combined with our innovative delivery systems including our proprietary encapsulation technology which consists of individual fragrance droplets coated with a protective polymeric shell to deliver superior fragrance performance throughout a products lifecycle these delivery systems are key differentiators in the growth of our consumer fragrance compounds 

fragrance compounds  fragrance compounds are unique and proprietary combinations of multiple ingredients that are ultimately used by our customers in their consumer goods our creative and commercial teams within fragrance compounds are organized into two broad categories fine fragrances and consumer fragrances 

 ingredients  fragrance ingredients consists of active and functional ingredients that are used internally and sold to third parties including customers and competitors for use in preparation of compounds while the principal role of our fragrance 

  5 

ingredients facilities is to support our fragrance compounds business we utilize our excess manufacturing capacity to manufacture and sell certain fragrance ingredients to third parties we believe that this business allows us to leverage our fixed costs while maintaining the security of supply for our perfumers and ultimately our customers fragrance ingredients available for sale to third parties include innovative ingredients that leverage our manufacturing experience as well as a limited amount of costcompetitive commodity ingredients as our fragrance compounds business grows we expect that the percentage of capacity allocated to the production of fragrance ingredients for sale to third parties may decrease fragrance ingredients also includes our cosmetic active and functional ingredients which provide biologists and cosmetic chemists with innovative solutions to address cosmetic challenges such as skin aging and hair protection 

with approximately 1300 separate fragrance and active and functional cosmetic ingredients plus additional botanicals and delivery systems we believe we are a leader in the industry with the breadth of our product portfolio 

consistent with our vision 2020 strategy fragrances continues to build upon our strengths to differentiate ourselves from our competitors address evolving consumer demands and deliver accelerated growth specifically we intend to focus on 

 research and product development process 

consumer insights 

we believe that the first step to creating a unique scent or taste experience begins with gaining insight into the consumer by developing a deep understanding of what consumers value and prefer we are better able to focus our rd and creative efforts our quest to bring innovative exciting and winning ideas to our clients begins with insight into the consumer 

our consumer insight and marketing teams work tirelessly interpreting trends monitoring product launches analyzing quantitative market data and conducting numerous consumer interviews annually our sensory experts direct research programs exploring topics such as fragrance performance the psychophysics of sensory perception including chemesthetic properties such as warming cooling and tingling the genetic basis for flavor and fragrance preference and the effects of aromas on mood performance health and wellbeing 

based on this information we develop innovative programs to evaluate potential products that enable us to understand the emotional connections between a prospective product and the consumer we believe this ability to pinpoint the likelihood of a product’s success translates into stronger brand equity resulting in increased returns and greater market share gains for our customers as well as iff 

research and development 

we consider our rd infrastructure to be one of our key competencies and we focus and invest substantial resources in the research and development of new and innovative molecules compounds formulas and technologies and the application of these to our customers’ products we spend approximately 8  of our sales on the research development and implementation of new molecules compounds and technologies that help our customers respond to changing consumer preferences using the knowledge gained from our consumer insights program we strategically focus our resources around key rd platforms that address consumer needs or preferences or anticipate future preferences by aligning our resources around these platforms we ensure the proper support and focus for each program so that it can be further developed and eventually accepted for 

  6 

commercial application as a result of this investment we have been granted 341  patents in the united states since 2000 including twentyseven  in 2017  and we have developed many unique molecules and delivery systems for our customers that are used as the foundations of successful flavors and fragrances around the world 

we principally conduct our rd activities in union beach new jersey where we employ scientists and application engineers who collaborate with our five other rd centers around the world to support the 

 as of december 31 2017  we employed about 1600  people globally in rd activities we spent 2860 million  2543 million  and 2461 million  or approximately 84  82  and 81  of sales in 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively on rd activities 

our ingredients research program discovers molecules found in natural substances and creates new molecules that are subsequently tested for their sensorial value to broaden our offerings of natural innovative and unique products we seek collaborations with research institutions and other companies throughout the world we have established a number of such collaborations to strengthen our innovation pipeline we may also consider acquiring companies that could provide access to new technologies consistent with our vision 2020 strategy 

the development of new and customized flavor and fragrance compounds is a complex process calling upon the combined knowledge of our scientists flavorists and perfumers scientists from various disciplines work in project teams with flavorists and perfumers to develop flavor and fragrance compounds with consumer preferred performance characteristics the development of new flavor and fragrance compounds requires i an indepth knowledge of the flavor and fragrance characteristics of the various ingredients we use ii an understanding of how the many ingredients in a consumer product interact and iii the creation of controlled release and delivery systems to enhance flavor and fragrance performance to facilitate this process we have a scientific advisory board that provides external perspectives and independent feedback on our rd and sustainability initiatives 

in 2017 we launched reimagine a multitiered program to accelerate innovation and increase agility to capture unmet opportunities in the changing food and beverage market based on a combination of future trends analysis consumer insights and a modernized crosscategory development process the program guides our research and development efforts to ensure an innovation pipeline that addresses evolving consumer needs and desires 

creative application 

we also have a network of sixtynine  creative centers and application laboratories around the world where we create or adapt the basic flavors or fragrances that we have developed in the rd process to commercialize for use in our customers’ consumer products our global creative teams consist of perfumers fragrance evaluators and flavorists as well as marketing consumer insights and technical application experts from a wide range of cultures and nationalities in close partnership with our customers’ product development groups our creative teams create the sensory experiences that our customers are seeking in order to satisfy consumer demands in each of their markets 

development of new flavors and fragrances is driven by a variety of sources including requests from our customers who are in need of a specific flavor or fragrance for use in a new or modified consumer product or as a result of internal initiatives stemming from our consumer insights program our product development team works in partnership with our scientists and researchers to optimize the consumer appeal of the flavor or fragrance a collaborative process between our researchers our product development team and our customers then follows to perfect the flavor or fragrance so that it is ready to be included in the final consumer product 

in addition to creating new flavors and fragrances our researchers and product development teams advise customers on ways to improve their existing products by adjusting or substituting current ingredients with more readily accessible or less expensive materials or by modifying the current ingredients to produce an enhanced yield this often results in creating a better value proposition for our customers 

our flavor and fragrance compound formulas are treated as trade secrets and remain our proprietary asset our business is not materially dependent upon any individual patent trademark or license

in connection with the manufacture of compounds we use natural ingredients and primarily in our fragrance compounds synthetic ingredients we purchase approximately 11000 different raw materials from about 3000 domestic and international suppliers and distributors approximately half of the materials we purchase are naturals or croprelated items and the other half are synthetics and chemicals natural ingredients are derived from flowers fruits and other botanical products as well as from animal products they contain varying numbers of organic chemicals that are responsible for the fragrance or flavor of the natural product natural products are purchased in processed or semiprocessed form some are used in compounds in the state in which they are purchased and others are used after further processing natural products together with various chemicals are also used as raw materials for the manufacture of synthetic ingredients by chemical processes our flavor products also include extracts and seasonings derived from various fruits vegetables nuts herbs and spices as well as microbiologicallyderived ingredients 

in order to ensure our supply of raw materials achieve favorable pricing and provide timely transparency regarding inflationary trends to our customers we continue to be focused on i implementing a forwardbuy strategy ii entering into supplier relationships to gain access to supplies that we do not have iii implementing indexed pricing iv reducing the complexity of our formulations and v evaluating whether it is more profitable to buy or make an ingredient we are also concentrating on local country sourcing with our own procurement professionals 

manufacturing and distribution 

we have thirtyseven  manufacturing sites around the world that supports more than 46000  products our major manufacturing facilities are located in the united states the netherlands spain great britain indonesia turkey brazil mexico china india and singapore our supply chain initiatives in developing markets are focused on increasing capacity and investments in key technologies within our more mature markets we tend to focus on consolidation and cost optimization as well as implementing new technologies in addition to our own manufacturing facilities we develop relationships with third parties including contract manufacturing organizations that permit us to expand access to the technologies capabilities and capacity that we need to better serve our customers 

based on the regional nature of the flavors business and the concerns regarding the fragile nature of transporting raw materials we have established smaller manufacturing facilities in our local markets that are focused on local needs products within the fragrances business are typically composed of compounds that are more stable and more transportable around the world consequently we have fewer manufacturing facilities within our fragrances business which produce compounds and ingredients for global distribution 

in 2017 we continued to invest in our facilities major capital projects included the construction of a second flavors compounding site in china breaking ground on a new flavors and fragrances plant in india as well as completing the relocation of one of our fragrance ingredients plants to a new site in jiande china in addition we reached an agreement to relocate our other fragrance ingredients facility in china from hangzhou to the jiande site by 2020 

sustainability 

as a leading global creator of flavors and fragrances for a wide variety of consumer products sustainability has been an important part of how we do business our sustainability strategy is centered on three main aspects positive principles regenerative products and sensational people 

 in 2017 we joined food reform for sustainability and health fresh a project of the world business council for sustainable development designed to improve the health of people and the planet by recalibrating the global systems of consumption transportation production and agriculture our participation in the food loss and waste work stream is aligned 

  8 

with our strategy that calls for developing regenerative products using circular economy principles we also partnered with mars wrigley confectionery to enhance the livelihoods of farmers in india while securing our supply chain of highquality natural mint in addition we were named by cdp to the climate a list for the third consecutive year for our leadership in carbon management cdp also awarded us leadership status for our water management strategy in addition we maintained gold status with an ecovadis score of 72 out of 100 points placing us in the top 1 of suppliers in the industry segment the ecovadis platform promotes increased focus on sustainable performance throughout the supply chain emphasizing the environment fair labor and fair business practices 

governmental regulation 

we develop produce and market our products in a number of jurisdictions throughout the world and are subject to federal regional and local legislation and regulations in each of the various countries our flavor and many of our fragrance products are intended for the food beverage and pharmaceutical industries which are subject to strict quality and regulatory standards as a result we are required to meet these strict standards which in recent years have become increasingly stringent 

our products and operations are subject to regulation by governmental agencies in each of the markets in which we operate these agencies include 1 the food and drug administration and equivalent international agencies that regulate flavors and other ingredients in consumer products 2 the environmental protection agency and equivalent international agencies that regulate our manufacturing facilities 3 the occupational safety and health administration and equivalent international agencies that regulate the working conditions in our manufacturing research laboratories and creative centers 4 local and international agencies that regulate trade and customs 5 the drug enforcement administration and other local or international agencies that regulate controlled chemicals that we use in our operations and 6 the chemical registrationnotification authorities that regulate chemicals that we use in or transport to the various countries in which we manufacture andor market our products we have seen an increase in registration and reporting requirements concerning the use of certain chemicals in a number of countries such as registration evaluation authorisation and restriction of chemicals reach regulations in the european union 

in addition we are subject to various rules relating to health work safety and the environment at the local and international levels in the various countries in which we operate our manufacturing facilities throughout the world are subject to environmental standards relating to air emissions sewage discharges the use of hazardous materials waste disposal practices and cleanup of existing environmental contamination in recent years there has been a significant increase in the stringency of environmental regulation and enforcement of environmental standards and the costs of compliance have risen significantly a trend we expect will continue in the future 

competition 

the flavors and fragrances market is part of a larger market which supplies a variety of ingredients and components that consumer products companies utilize in their products the broader market includes large multinational companies or smaller regional and local participants which supply products such as seasonings texturizers spices enzymes certain foodrelated commodities fortified products and cosmetic ingredients 

the market for flavors and fragrances is highly competitive based on annual sales our main competitors consist of 1 the three other large global flavor and fragrance manufacturers givaudan firmenich and symrise 2 midsized companies 3 numerous local and regional manufacturers and 4 consumer product companies who may develop their own flavors or fragrances 

we believe that our ability to compete successfully in the flavors and fragrances submarket is based on 1 our indepth understanding of consumers 2 innovation arising from the creative skills of our perfumers and flavorists and the technological advances resulting from our research and development activities 3 our ability to create products which are tailormade for our customers’ needs 4 developing strong customer intimacy 5 driving efficiency in all that we do 6 quality products and 7 our broadbased regulatory capabilities 

large multinational customers and increasingly midsized customers may limit the number of their suppliers by placing some on “core lists” giving them priority for development and production of their new or modified products 

to compete more successfully in this environment we must make continued investments in customer relationships and tailor our research and development efforts to anticipate customers’ needs provide effective service and secure and maintain inclusion on certain “core lists”

risk factors 

tableend

we routinely encounter and address risks in conducting our business some of these risks may cause our future results to be different  sometimes materially different  than we presently anticipate below are material risks we have identified that could adversely affect our business how we react to material future developments as well as how our competitors and customers react to those developments could also affect our future results 

our business is highly competitive and if we are unable to compete effectively our sales and results of operations will suffer 

the market for flavors and fragrances is highly competitive we face vigorous competition from companies throughout the world including multinational and specialized flavor fragrance and cosmetic ingredients companies as well as consumer product companies who may develop their own flavors fragrances or cosmetic ingredients in the flavors industry we also face increasing competition from ingredient suppliers that have expanded their portfolios to include flavor offerings some of our competitors specialize in one or more of our product subsegments while others participate in many of our product subsegments in addition some of our global competitors may have greater resources than we do or may have proprietary products that could permit them to respond to changing business and economic conditions more effectively than we can 

  11 

consolidation of our competitors may exacerbate these risks with our entry into cosmetic ingredients we may face greater competitionrelated risks in this market than with our core historic flavor and fragrances businesses 

competition in our business is based on innovation product quality regulatory compliance pricing quality of customer service the support provided by marketing and application groups and understanding of consumers it is difficult for us to predict the timing scale and success of our competitors’ actions in these areas in particular the discovery and development of new flavors and fragrance compounds and ingredients protection of the company’s intellectual property and development and retention of key employees are critical to our ability to effectively compete in our business increased competition by existing or future competitors including aggressive price competition could result in the potential loss of substantial sales or create the need for us to reduce prices or increase spending and this could have an adverse impact on sales and profitability 

if we are unable to provide our customers with innovative costeffective products that allow them to achieve their own profitability expectations our sales and results of operations will suffer 

during 2017  our 25 largest customers accounted for 50  of our sales and the largest customer across all enduse categories accounted for 11  to 12 of our sales for each of the last three fiscal years loss of or a reduction in sales to our largest customer or any of our other large customers for an extended period of time could adversely affect our business or financial results 

large multinational customers and increasingly middlemarket customers are unilaterally limiting the number of their suppliers or rationalizing the number of products that they offer to increase their margins and profitability as part of these initiatives these customers are creating “core lists” of suppliers and giving these “core lists” suppliers priority for new or modified products recently these customers are making inclusion on their “core lists” contingent upon a supplier providing more favorable commercial terms which may adversely affect our margins these and other profitability initiatives being pursued by our customers reduce the market opportunity for which we compete and subject the volume and pricing of the remaining suppliers to downward pressure to be successful in this competitive environment we must continue to make investments in customer relationships and tailor product research and development in order to anticipate customers’ needs deliver products that contribute to our customers’ profitability provide effective customer service and offer competitive costinuse solutions to secure and maintain inclusion on certain “core lists” and our share of our customers’ purchases if we are unable to do so it could adversely impact our future results of operations 

we may not successfully develop and introduce new products that meet our customers’ needs which may adversely affect our results of operations 

our ability to differentiate ourselves and deliver growth in line with our vision 2020 strategy largely depends on our ability to successfully develop and introduce new products and product improvements that meet our customers’ needs and ultimately appeal to consumers innovation is a key element of our ability to develop and introduce new products we cannot be certain that we will be successful in achieving our innovation goals such as the development of new molecules new and expanded delivery systems and other technologies we currently spend approximately 8  of our sales on research and development however such investments may only generate future revenues to the extent that we are able to develop products that meet our customers’ specifications are at an acceptable cost and achieve acceptance by the targeted consumer market furthermore there may be significant lag times from the time we incur rd costs to the time that these rd costs may result in increased revenue consequently even when we “win” a project our ability to generate revenues as a result of these investments is subject to numerous customer economic and other risks that are outside of our control including delays by our customers in the launch of a new product the level of promotional support for the launch poor performance of our thirdparty vendors anticipated sales by our customers not being realized or changes in market preferences or demands or disruptive innovations by competitors 

  12 

a disruption in our manufacturing operations or our supply chain could adversely affect our business and financial results 

as a company engaged in research and development manufacturing and distribution on a global scale we and our suppliers are subject to the risks inherent in such activities including industrial accidents environmental events strikes and other labor disputes disruptions in supply chain or information systems disruption or loss of key research or manufacturing sites product quality control safety licensing requirements and other regulatory issues as well as natural disasters international conflicts terrorist acts and other external factors over which we have no control while we operate research and development and manufacturing facilities throughout the world many of these facilities are extremely specialized and certain of our facilities or certain suppliers are the sole source of a specific ingredient or product if our research and development activities or the manufacturing of ingredients or products were disrupted the cost of relocating or replacing these activities or reformulating these ingredients or products may be substantial which could result in production or development delays or otherwise have an adverse effect on our margins operating results and future growth 

a disruption in our supply chain including the inability to obtain ingredients and raw materials from third parties could adversely affect our business and financial results 

in connection with our manufacture of our fragrance and flavor compounds we often rely on third party suppliers for ingredients and raw materials that are integral to our manufacture of such compounds our purchases of raw materials are subject to fluctuations in market price and availability caused by weather growing and harvesting conditions market conditions governmental actions and other factors beyond our control in addition our ingredient suppliers similar to us are subject to the risks inherent in manufacturing and distribution on a global scale including industrial accidents environmental events strikes and other labor disputes disruptions in supply chain or information systems disruption or loss of key research or manufacturing sites product quality control safety and environmental compliance issues licensing requirements and other regulatory issues as well as natural disasters international conflicts terrorist acts and other external factors over which they have no control these suppliers also could become insolvent or experience other financial distress for example a fire at the manufacturing facility of basf group basf one of our suppliers in 2017 caused them to declare a force majeure and has resulted in a disruption of the availability of certain ingredients used in some of our fragrance and flavor compounds if our suppliers are unable to supply us with sufficient ingredients and raw materials to meet our needs we would need to seek alternative sources of such materials or pursue our own production of such ingredients or direct acquisition of such raw materials however for certain of our raw ingredients and raw materials we rely on a limited number of suppliers where there are not readily available alternatives if we are unable to obtain or manufacture alternative sources of such ingredients or raw materials at a similar cost we would seek to i reformulate our compounds andor 2 increase pricing to reflect the higher supply cost however if we are not able to successfully implement any of these alternatives we could experience disruptions in production increased cost of sales and a corresponding decrease in gross margin or reduced sales if our competitors were able to more successfully adjust to such market disruption such fluctuations and decrease in gross margin could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may not be able to successfully identify and complete sufficient acquisitions to meet our vision 2020 strategy and even if we are able to do so we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions 

as part of our vision 2020 strategy we intend to add between 500 million and 10 billion of sales growth through acquisitions within the flavors and fragrances industries and adjacencies since 2015 we have completed five acquisitions which align with this strategic objective most recently acquiring fragrance resources a privatelyheld fragrance company and powderpure a producer capable of providing clean label flavor solutions in 2017 

identifying suitable acquisition candidates can be difficult timeconsuming and costly and we may not be able to identify suitable candidates or complete acquisitions in a timely manner on a costeffective basis or at all 

even if we complete an acquisition we may not realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisition our recent acquisitions have required and any similar future transactions may also require significant efforts and expenditures including with respect to integrating the acquired business with our historical business we may encounter unexpected difficulties or incur unexpected costs in connection with acquisition activities and integration efforts which include 



  13 

 if any of our acquisitions do not perform as anticipated for any of the reasons noted above or otherwise there could be a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

the interruption or failure of key information technology systems or a loss of data malicious attack or other breach of security of our information technology systems may have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business subject us to increased operating costs damage our reputation and expose us to litigation 

we rely on information technology systems including some managed by thirdparty providers to conduct business and support our business processes including product formulas product development sales order processing production distribution internal communications and communications with third parties throughout the world processing transactions summarizing and reporting results of operations complying with regulatory tax or legal requirements and collecting and storing customer supplier employee and other stakeholder information these systems may be susceptible to disruptions or outages due to fire floods power loss telecommunications failures natural disasters cyberattacks failed upgrades or other similar events or due to the poor performance of thirdparty providers an effective response to disruptions will require effort and diligence on the part of our employees and thirdparty providers to avoid any adverse impact to our business in addition our systems and proprietary data stored electronically may be vulnerable to computer viruses cybercrime computer hacking and similar information security breaches which in turn could result in the unauthorized release or misuse of confidential or proprietary information about our business including but not limited to the trade secrets upon which we rely to protect our proprietary fragrance and flavor formulations employees or customers and disrupt our operations depending on their nature and scope these threats could potentially lead to improper use of our systems and networks manipulation and destruction of data or product noncompliance the occurrence of any of these events could disrupt our business and have a material adverse effect on our sales subject us to increased operating costs damage our reputation and expose us to litigation or regulatory proceedings 

if we are unable to successfully market to our expanding and decentralized flavors customer base our operating results and future growth may be adversely affected 

the industries in which our flavors customers operate are expanding and becoming increasingly decentralized our historical customer based was primarily comprised of large food and beverage companies which have faced in recent years growing competition from midsize regional companies and companies focused on nicheproduct categories driving and accelerating product innovation in connection with vision 2020 we identified serving these clients as a key element of our business strategy and invested in this strategy through the acquisition of ottens flavors and david michael in 2017 we announced the creation of tastepoint by iff designed to service the middlemarket customer in north america which is focused on servicing customers with the “cando” approach of a smaller company backed by expertise traditionally reserved for companies with a more of a global reach however if we are unable to successfully implement this strategy or gain market share with this growing customer base our future growth could be adversely affected 

increasing awareness of health and wellness are driving changes in the consumer products industry and if we are unable to react in a timely and costeffective manner our results of operations and future growth may be adversely affected 

we must continually anticipate and react in a timely and costeffective manner to changes in consumer preferences and demands including changes in demand driven by increasing awareness of health and wellness and demands for transparency with respect to product ingredients consumers especially in developed economies such as the united states and western europe are shifting away from products containing artificial ingredients to all natural healthier alternatives in addition there has been a growing demand by consumers nongovernmental organizations and to a lesser extent governmental agencies to provide more transparency in product labeling and our customers have been taking steps to address this demand including by voluntarily providing productspecific ingredients disclosure these two trends could affect the 

  14 

types and volumes of our flavors and fragrances that our customers include in their product offerings if we are unable to react to or anticipate these trends in a timely and costeffective manner our results of operations and future growth may be adversely affected 

we may not succeed in establishing and maintaining collaborations joint ventures or partnerships and such arrangements may not lead to development or commercialization of products which may limit our ability to execute our vision 2020 strategy and adversely affect our future growth 

from time to time and in line with our vision 2020 strategy we may evaluate and enter into collaborations joint ventures or partnerships to enhance our research and development efforts our ability to generate revenues from such collaborations will depend on our partners’ abilities and efforts to successfully perform the functions assigned to them in these arrangements the process of establishing and maintaining collaborative relationships is difficult timeconsuming to negotiate document and implement we may not be successful in our efforts to establish and implement collaborations or other alternative arrangements should we choose to enter into such arrangements and the terms of the arrangements may not be favorable to us additionally collaborations may not lead to development or commercialization of products in the most efficient manner or at all if we are unable to establish and maintain collaborative relationships on acceptable terms or to successfully transition terminated collaborative agreements it could limit our ability to execute our vision 2020 strategy and adversely affect our future growth 

we have made investments in and continue to expand our business into emerging markets which exposes us to certain risks 

as part of our growth strategy we have increased our presence in emerging markets by expanding our manufacturing presence sales organization and product offerings in these markets and we expect to continue to expand our business in these markets in addition to the currency and international operation risks described below our operations in these markets may be subject to a variety of other risks emerging markets typically have a consumer base with limited or fluctuating disposable income and customer demand in these markets may fluctuate accordingly as a result decrease in customer demand in emerging markets may have an adverse effect on our ability to execute our growth strategy in addition emerging markets may have weak legal systems which may affect our ability to enforce our intellectual property and contractual rights exchange controls unstable governments and privatization or other government actions that may affect taxes subsidies and incentive programs and the flow of goods and currency in conducting our business we move products from one country to another and may provide services in one country from a subsidiary located in another country accordingly we are vulnerable to abrupt changes in trade customs and tax regimes in these markets that may have significant negative impacts on our financial condition and operating results 

the impact of currency fluctuation or devaluation in the international markets in which we operate may negatively affect our results of operations 

we have significant operations outside the united states the results of which are reported in the local currency and then translated into united states dollars at applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements the exchange rates between these currencies and the united states dollar have fluctuated and will continue to do so in the future changes in exchange rates between these local currencies and the united states dollar will affect the recorded levels of sales profitability assets andor liabilities additionally volatility in currency exchange rates may adversely impact our financial condition cash flows or liquidity although we employ a variety of techniques to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations including sourcing strategies and a limited number of foreign currency hedging activities we cannot guarantee that such hedging and risk management strategies will be effective and our results of operations could be adversely affected 

our international operations are subject to regulatory political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues cash flows or financial position 

we operate on a global basis with manufacturing and sales facilities in the united states europe africa the middle east latin america and greater asia during 2017 75  of our net sales were to customers outside the united states and we intend to continue expansion of our international operations as a result our business is increasingly exposed to risks inherent in international operations these risks which can vary substantially by location include the following 



  15 

 the occurrence of any one or more of these factors could increase our costs and adversely affect our results of operations 

economic uncertainty may adversely affect demand for consumer products using flavors and fragrances and this may have a negative impact on our operating results and future growth 

our flavors and fragrance compounds and ingredients are components of a wide assortment of global consumer products throughout the world historically demand for consumer products using flavors and fragrances was stimulated and broadened by changing social habits and consumer needs population growth an expanding global middleclass and general economic growth especially in emerging markets the global economy has experienced significant recessionary pressures and declines in consumer confidence and economic growth while some segments of the global economy appear to be recovering the ongoing global recessionary economic environment in europe has and may in the near future increase unemployment and underemployment decrease salaries and wage rates increase inflation or result in other marketwide cost pressures that will adversely affect demand for consumer products in both developed and emerging markets in addition growth rates in the emerging markets have moderated from previous levels reduced consumer spending may cause changes in our customer orders including reduced demand for our flavors and fragrances or order cancellations 

the timing of placing of orders and the amounts of these orders are generally at our customers discretion customers may cancel reduce or postpone orders with us on relatively short notice significant cancellations reductions or delays in orders by customers could affect our quarterly results 

it is currently anticipated that these challenging economic uncertainty will continue to affect certain of our markets during 2018 which could adversely affect our sales profitability and overall operating results 

our success depends on attracting and retaining talented people within our business significant shortfalls in recruitment or retention could adversely affect our ability to compete and achieve our strategic goals 

attracting developing and retaining talented employees including our perfumers and flavorists is essential to the successful delivery of our products and success in the marketplace furthermore as we continue to focus on innovation our need for scientists and other professionals will increase competition for all these types of employees can be intense the ability to attract and retain talented employees is critical in the development of new products and technologies which is an integral component of our growth strategy however we may not be able to attract and retain such employees in the future if we experience significant shortfalls in recruitment or retention our ability to effectively compete with our competitors and to grow our business could be adversely affected 

  16 

failure to comply with environmental protection laws may cause us to close relocate or operate one or more of our plants at reduced production levels which could adversely affect our operating results and future growth 

our business operations and properties are subject to extensive and increasingly stringent federal state local and foreign laws and regulations pertaining to protection of the environment including air emissions sewage discharges the use of hazardous materials waste disposal practices and cleanup of existing environmental contamination failure to comply with these laws and regulations or any future changes to them may result in significant consequences to us including the need to close or relocate one or more of our production facilities administrative civil and criminal penalties liability for damages and negative publicity if we are unable to meet production requirements we can lose customer orders which can adversely affect our future growth or we may be required to make incremental capital investments to ensure supply for example in 2015 chinese authorities notified us of compliance issues pertaining to the emission of odors from several of our plants in china and consequently we invested approximately 65 million in odorabatement equipment at these facilities and have located a site for construction of a second flavors manufacturing facility in china with an estimated cost of 45 million we have also recently completed negotiations with the chinese government concerning the relocation of a second fragrance facility in china idling of facilities or production modifications has caused or may cause customers to seek alternate suppliers due to concerns regarding supply interruptions and these customers may not return or may order at reduced levels even once issues are remediated if these noncompliance issues reoccur in china or occur or in any other jurisdiction we may lose business and may be required to incur capital spending above previous expectations close a plant or operate a plant at significantly reduced production levels on a permanent basis and our operating results and cash flows from operations may be adversely affected 

our ongoing optimization of our manufacturing facilities may not be as effective as we anticipate and we may fail to realize the expected cost savings and increased efficiencies 

as part of our strategy we seek to enhance our manufacturing efficiency and align our geographic manufacturing footprint with our expectations of future growth and technology needs many of our facilities are located in close proximity to our customers in order to minimize both our customers’ and our own costs however we may not have sufficient demand to utilize all of our production capacity and may be required to ship excess products to other regions in which we operate which will increase our costs and decrease our margins to operate more efficiently and control costs from time to time we also execute rationalization activities which include manufacturing facility consolidations for example we are in the midst of relocating our flavors facility in hangzhou china constructing a new facility in indonesia and expect to begin relocating a fragrance facility in china we also recently broke ground on a new flavors and fragrances facility in india the spending associated with these projects may result in capital spending above previous expectations our ability to realize anticipated cost savings synergies and revenue enhancements from these activities may be affected by a number of factors and may pose significant risks including 

 furthermore our rationalization and consolidation actions may not be as effective as we anticipate and we may fail to realize the cost savings we expect from these actions actual charges costs and adjustments due to these activities may vary materially from our estimates and these activities may require cash and noncash integration and implementation costs or charges in excess of budgeted amounts which could offset any such savings and other synergies and therefore could have an adverse effect on our margins 

volatility and increases in the price of raw materials energy and transportation could harm our profits 

we use many different raw materials for our business including essential oils extracts and concentrates derived from fruits vegetables flowers woods and other botanicals animal products raw fruits organic chemicals and petroleumbased chemicals historically we have experienced a considerable amount of price volatility in natural products that represent approximately half of our raw material purchases and we expect this volatility to continue in the near future for example during and in 2017 we experienced increases in the prices of certain naturals including citrus and vanilla availability and pricing of these natural products can be impacted by crop size and quality weather alternative land use and other factors which we cannot control

if we are unable to increase the prices to our customers of our fragrance or flavor products to offset raw material and other input cost increases or if we are unable to achieve cost savings to offset such cost increases we could fail to meet our cost expectations and our profits and operating results could be adversely affected increases in prices of our products to customers may lead to declines in volume and we may not be able to accurately predict the volume impact of price increases which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

similarly commodities and energy prices are subject to significant volatility caused by market fluctuations supply and demand currency fluctuations production and transportation disruptions and other world events as we source many of our raw materials globally to help ensure quality control if the cost of energy shipping or transportation increases and we are unable to pass along these costs to our customers our profit margins would be adversely affected furthermore increasing our prices to our customers could result in longterm sales declines or loss of market share if our customers find alternative suppliers or choose to reformulate their consumer products to use fewer ingredients which could have an adverse longterm impact on our results of operations 

to mitigate our sourcing risk we maintain strategic stock levels for critical items however if we do not accurately estimate the amount of raw materials that will be used for the geographic region in which we will need these materials our margins could be adversely affected 

if we are unable to maintain the integrity of our raw materials supply chain and finished goods or fail to comply with applicable regulations it may result in regulatory noncompliance litigation costs customer loss and harm to our reputation all of which may adversely impact sales and our results of operations 

the development manufacture and sale of our products are subject to various regulatory requirements in each of the countries in which our products are developed manufactured and sold in addition we are subject to product safety and compliance requirements established by the industry or similar oversight bodies we use a variety of strategies methodologies and tools to i identify current product standards ii assess relative risks in our supply chain that can impact product integrity iii monitor internal and external performance and iv test raw materials and finished goods to minimize the likelihood of product or process noncompliance 

gaps in our operational processes or those of our suppliers could adversely affect the quality of our finished products subject us to a recall and result in a regulatory noncompliance event for instance we may be required to recall certain of our products should they be mislabeled contaminated or damaged and certain of our raw materials could be blocked from entering a country if they are subject to import alerts product noncompliance events could subject us to customer claims recalls penalties litigation costs and settlements remediation costs or loss of sales as our flavors and fragrance compounds and ingredients are used in many products intended for human use or consumption these consequences would be exacerbated if we or our customer did not identify the defect before the product reaches the consumer and there was a resulting impact at the consumer level such a result could lead to potentially large scale adverse publicity negative effects on consumers health recalls and potential consumer litigation in addition if we do not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification from suppliers or other third parties or if insurance or indemnification is not available the liability relating to product or possible thirdparty claims arising from defective products could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations furthermore adverse publicity about our products or our customers products that contain our ingredients including concerns about product safety or similar issues whether real or perceived could harm our reputation and result in an immediate adverse effect on our sales and customer relationships as well as require us to utilize significant resources to rebuild our reputation 

our performance may be adversely impacted if we are not successful in managing our inventory andor working capital balances 

we evaluate our inventory balances of materials based on shelf life expected sourcing levels known uses and anticipated demand based on forecasted customer order activity and changes in our productsales mix efficient inventory management is a key component of our business success financial returns and profitability to be successful we must maintain sufficient inventory levels and an appropriate productsales mix to meet our customers’ demands without allowing those levels to increase to such an extent that the costs associated with storing and holding other inventory adversely impact our financial results if our buying decisions do not accurately predict sourcing levels customer trends or our expectations about customer needs are inaccurate we may have to take unanticipated markdowns or impairment charges to dispose of the excess or obsolete inventory which can adversely impact our financial results additionally we believe excess inventory levels of raw materials with a short shelf life in our manufacturing facilities subjects us to the risk of increased inventory shrinkage if we are not successful in managing our inventory balances and shrinkage our results of and cash flows from operations may be negatively affected 

  18 

we sell certain accounts receivable on a nonrecourse basis to unrelated financial institutions under “factoring” agreements that are sponsored solely and individually by certain customers the cost of participating in these programs was immaterial to our results in all periods should we choose not to participate or if these programs were no longer available it could reduce our cash flows from operations in the period in which the arrangement ends 

we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act or similar us or foreign antibribery and anticorruption laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate 

the global nature of our business the significance of our international revenue and our focus on emerging markets create various domestic and local regulatory challenges and subject us to risks associated with our international operations the us foreign corrupt practices act or fcpa and similar antibribery and anticorruption laws and regulations in other countries generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or for other commercial advantage in addition us public companies are required to maintain records that accurately and fairly represent their transactions and have an adequate system of internal accounting controls under the fcpa us companies may be held liable for the corrupt actions taken by directors officers employees agents or other strategic or local partners or representatives as such if we or our intermediaries fail to comply with the requirements of the fcpa or similar legislation governmental authorities in the united states and elsewhere could seek to impose substantial civil andor criminal fines and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation operating results and financial condition 

we operate or may pursue opportunities in some jurisdictions such as china india brazil and africa which pose potentially elevated risks of fraud or corruption or increased risk of internal control issues in certain jurisdictions compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices from time to time we have conducted and will conduct internal investigations of the relevant facts and circumstances control testing and compliance reviews and take remedial actions when appropriate to help ensure that we are in compliance with applicable corruption and similar laws and regulations detecting investigating and resolving actual or alleged violations of the fcpa or similar laws is expensive and could consume significant time and attention of our senior management we could be subject to inquiries or investigations by government and other regulatory bodies any allegations of noncompliance with the fcpa or similar laws could have a disruptive effect on our operations in such jurisdiction over the near term including interruptions of business or loss of thirdparty relationships which may negatively impact our results of operations or financial condition any determination that our operations or activities are not in compliance with the fcpa or similar laws could expose us to severe criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions significant fines termination of necessary licenses and permits and penalties or other sanctions that may harm our business and reputation 

our ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights 

we rely on patents and trade secrets to protect our intellectual property rights we often rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary fragrance and flavor formulations as this does not require us to publicly file information regarding our intellectual property from time to time a third party may claim that we have infringed upon or misappropriated their intellectual property rights or a third party may infringe upon or misappropriate our intellectual property rights we could incur significant costs in connection with legal actions to assert our intellectual property rights against third parties or to defend ourselves from third party assertions of invalidity infringement or misappropriation or other claims any settlement or adverse judgment resulting from such litigation could require us to obtain a license to continue to use the intellectual property rights that are the subject of the claim or otherwise restrict or prohibit our use of such intellectual property rights any required licensing fees may not be available to us on acceptable terms if at all for those intellectual property rights that are protected as trade secrets this litigation could result in even higher costs and potentially the loss of certain rights since we would not have a perfected intellectual property right that precludes others from making using or selling our products or processes the ongoing trend among our customers towards more transparent labeling could further diminish our ability to effectively protect our proprietary flavor formulations 

for intellectual property rights that we seek to protect through patents we cannot be certain that these rights if obtained will not later be opposed invalidated or circumvented in addition even if such rights are obtained in the united states the laws of some of the other countries in which our products are or may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states if other parties were to infringe on our intellectual property rights or if a third party successfully asserted that we had infringed on their intellectual property rights it could materially and adversely affect our future results of operations by i reducing the price that we could obtain in the marketplace for products which are based on such rights ii increasing the royalty or other fees that we may be required to pay in connection with such rights or iii limiting the volume if any of such products that we can sell 

our results of operations may be negatively impacted by the outcome of uncertainties related to litigation 

  19 

from time to time we are involved in a number of legal claims and litigation including claims related to intellectual property product liability environmental matters and indirect taxes we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of such litigation in addition we cannot provide assurance that future events will not result in an increase in the number of claims or require an increase in the amount accrued for any such claims or require accrual for one or more claims that has not been previously accrued in addition if we were found liable we could be subject to certain indemnification claims there can be no assurance that our insurance will be adequate to protect us from all material expenses related to pending and future claims or that such levels of insurance will be available in the future at economical prices 

the level of returns on pension and postretirement plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used for valuation purposes could affect our earnings and cash flows in future periods changes in government regulations could also affect our pension and postretirement plan expenses and funding requirements 

the funding obligations for our pension plans are impacted by the performance of the financial markets particularly the equity markets and interest rates funding obligations are determined under government regulations and are measured each year based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date if the financial markets do not provide the longterm returns that are expected under the governmental funding calculations we could be required to make larger contributions the equity markets can be very volatile and therefore our estimate of future contribution requirements can change dramatically in relatively short periods of time similarly changes in interest rates and legislation enacted by governmental authorities can impact the timing and amounts of contribution requirements an adverse change in the funded status of the plans could significantly increase our required contributions in the future and adversely impact our liquidity 

assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans are determined by us in consultation with outside consultants and advisors in the event that we determine that changes are warranted in the assumptions used such as the discount rate expected longterm rate of return on assets or expected health care costs our future pension and postretirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease due to changing market conditions or changes in the participant population the assumptions that we use may differ from actual results which could have a significant impact on our pension and postretirement liabilities and related costs and funding requirements 

any future impairment of our tangible or intangible longlived assets may adversely impact our profitability 

a significant portion of our assets consists of longlived assets including tangible assets such as our manufacturing facilities and intangible assets and goodwill as of december 31 2017  we had recorded approximately 16 billion  of intangible assets and goodwill including goodwill and intangible assets related to our acquisitions longlived assets are subject to an impairment analysis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable additionally goodwill is subject to an impairment test at least annually indicators such as under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results changes in the company’s strategy for its overall business or use of acquired assets unexpected negative industry or economic trends decreased market capitalization relative to net book values unanticipated competitive activities change in consumer demand loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts may signal that an asset has become impaired to the extent any of our acquisitions do not perform as anticipated whether due to internal or external factors the value of such assets may be negatively affected and we may be required to record impairment charges our results of operations and financial position in future periods could be negatively impacted should future impairments of our longlived assets including intangible assets or goodwill occur 

changes in our tax rates the adoption of new united states or international tax legislation or changes in existing tax laws could expose us to additional tax liabilities that may affect our future results 

we are subject to taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in liabilities for uncertain tax positions cost of repatriations or changes in tax laws or their interpretation any of these changes could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 

we have and will continue to implement transfer pricing policies among our various operations located in different countries these transfer pricing policies are a significant component of the management and compliance of our operations across international boundaries and overall financial results many countries routinely examine transfer pricing policies of taxpayers subject to their jurisdiction challenge transfer pricing policies aggressively where there is potential noncompliance and impose significant interest charges and penalties where noncompliance is determined there can be no assurance that a governmental authority will not challenge these policies more aggressively in the future or if challenged that we will prevail we could suffer significant costs related to one or more challenges to our transfer pricing policies 

  20 

we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and foreign tax authorities in those countries in which we operate and we may be subject to assessments or audits in the future in any of the countries in which we operate the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals and while we do not believe the results that follow would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition such results could have a material effect on our income tax provision net income or cash flows in the period or periods in which that determination is made 

in addition a number of international legislative and regulatory bodies have proposed legislation and begun investigations of the tax practices of multinational companies and in the european union “eu” the tax policies of certain eu member states one of these efforts has been led by the oecd an international association of 34 countries including the united states which has finalized recommendations to revise corporate tax transfer pricing and tax treaty provisions in member countries since 2013 the european commission “ec” has been investigating tax rulings granted by tax authorities in a number of eu member states with respect to specific multinational corporations to determine whether such rulings comply with eu rules on state aid as well as more recent investigations of the tax regimes of certain eu member states under eu law selective tax advantages for particular taxpayers that are not sufficiently grounded in economic realities may constitute impermissible state aid if the ec determines that a tax ruling or tax regime violates the state aid restrictions the tax authorities of the affected eu member state may be required to collect back taxes for the period of time covered by the ruling in late 2015 and early 2016 the ec declared that tax rulings related to other companies by tax authorities in luxembourg the netherlands and belgium did not comply with the eu state aid restrictions if the ec were to successfully challenge tax rulings applicable to us in any of the eu member states in which we are subject to taxation we could be exposed to increased tax liabilities 

the recently adopted us tax legislation may result in additional tax liabilities that may affect our future results and profitability 

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” that significantly revises the us tax code effective january 1 2018 by among other things lowering the corporate income tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35 to a flat 21 limiting deductibility of interest expense and performance based incentive compensation transitioning to a territorial system and creating new taxes associated with global operations the tax act impacted our  consolidated results of operations during the 2017 fourth quarter and is expected to continue to impact our  consolidated results of operations in future periods in particular the transition to the new territorial tax system required  us to record a onetime tax or “toll charge” which resulted in a provisional incremental tax expense of 1006 million  principally related to previously unremitted earnings on nonus subsidiaries the cash portion of the toll charge will be payable in installments over 8  years beginning in 2018 in addition the reduction of the us corporate tax rate resulted in a provisional net deferred tax expense of   386 million  related to the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets as a result of the reduction in the corporate income tax rate given the significant complexity of the tax act anticipated guidance from the us treasury about implementing the tax act and the potential for additional guidance from the sec or the fasb the company’s provisional charge may be adjusted during 2018 and is expected to be finalized no later than the fourth quarter of 2018 other provisions of the tax act that impact future tax years are still being assessed any material revisions in the companys computations could adversely affect its cash flows and results of operations 

in future periods we expect that our effective tax rate will be impacted by the lower us corporate tax rate that will initially be offset by the elimination of the deductibility of performance based incentive compensation and other provisions of the tax act that may impact us prospectively however the ultimate impact of the tax act will depend on additional regulatory or accounting guidance that may be issued with respect to the tax act and any operating and structural changes that we may undertake to permit us to benefit from the new lower us tax rate prospectively this could adversely affect our results of operations 

the potential government regulation of certain of our product development initiatives is uncertain and we may be subject to adverse consequences if we fail to comply with applicable regulations 

as part of our ingredients research program we seek to collaborate with research institutions and companies throughout the world including biotechnology companies however it is unclear whether any of our product developments will be classified as genetically modified food products subject to regulation as a biotechnology product the manufacture of biotechnology products is subject to applicable current good manufacturing practice cgmp regulations as prescribed by the food and drug administration and the applicable standards prescribed by european commission and the competent authorities of european union member states and to other rules and regulations prescribed by foreign regulatory authorities compliance with these regulations can be expensive and time consuming such regulation could also subject us to requirements for labeling and traceability which may cause our customers to avoid our affected products and seek our 

  21 

competitors’ products this may result in our inability to realize any benefit from our investment and have an adverse effect on our operating results 

the united kingdom’s expected departure from the european union in 2019 could have an adverse effect on us 

in june 2016 the united kingdom held a referendum in which a majority of voters voted to exit the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” and negotiations are underway to determine the terms of the uk’s withdrawal from the european union a withdrawal could among other outcomes disrupt the free movement of goods services and people between the uk and the european union undermine bilateral cooperation in key geographic areas and significantly disrupt trade between the uk and the european union or other nations as the uk pursues independent trade relations in addition brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the uk determines which european union laws to replace or replicate the effects of brexit will depend on any agreements the uk makes to retain access to european union or other markets either during a transitional period or more permanently given the lack of comparable precedent it is unclear what financial trade and legal implications the withdrawal of the uk from the european union would have and how such withdrawal would affect us adverse consequences concerning brexit or the european union could include deterioration in global economic conditions instability in global financial markets political uncertainty volatility in currency exchange rates or adverse changes in the crossborder agreements currently in place any of which could have an adverse impact on our financial results in the future

legal proceedings

we are subject to various claims and legal actions in the ordinary course of our business 

environmental 

over the past 20 years various federal and state authorities and private parties have claimed that we are a potentially responsible party “prp” as a generator of waste materials for alleged pollution at a number of waste sites operated by third parties located principally in new jersey and have sought to recover costs incurred and to be incurred to clean up the sites 

we have been identified as a prp at eight  facilities operated by third parties at which investigation andor remediation activities may be ongoing we analyze our potential liability on at least a quarterly basis we accrue for environmental liabilities when they are probable and estimable we estimate our share of the total future cost for these sites to be less than 50 million  

while joint and several liability is authorized under federal and state environmental laws we believe the amounts we have paid and anticipate paying in the future for cleanup costs and damages at all sites are not material and will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity this assessment is based upon among other things the involvement of other prps at most of the sites the status of the proceedings including various settlement agreements and consent decrees and the extended time period over which payments will likely be made there can be no assurance however that future events will not require us to materially increase the amounts we anticipate paying for cleanup costs and damages at these sites and that such increased amounts will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

flavors are the key building blocks that impart taste experiences in food and beverage products and as such play a significant role in determining consumer preference for the end products in which they are used as a leading creator of flavors we help our customers deliver on the promise of delicious and healthy foods and drinks that appeal to consumers while we are a global leader our flavors business is more regional in nature with different formulas that reflect local taste preferences our flavors compounds are ultimately used by our customers in four enduse categories 1 savory 2 beverages 3 sweet and 4 dairy 

we are a global leader in the creation of fragrance compounds that are integral elements in the world’s finest perfumes and bestknown consumer products within fabric care home care personal wash hair care and toiletries products our fragrances business consists of fragrance compounds and fragrance ingredients our fragrance compounds are defined into two broad categories fine fragrances and consumer fragrances consumer fragrances consists of five enduse categories of products 1 fabric care 2 home care 3 personal wash 4 hair care and 5 toiletries fragrance ingredients consist of active and functional ingredients that are used internally and sold to third parties including customers and competitors and are included in the fragrances business unit 

the flavors and fragrances market is part of a larger market that supplies a wide variety of ingredients and compounds that are used in consumer products the broader market includes large multinational companies and smaller regional and local participants which supply products such as seasonings texturizers spices enzymes certain foodrelated commodities fortified products and cosmetic active ingredients the global market for flavors and fragrances has expanded consistently primarily as a result of an increase in demand for as well as an increase in the variety of consumer products containing flavors and fragrances in 2017  the flavors and fragrances market was estimated by management to be approximately 248 billion  and is forecasted to grow approximately 23  by 2021  primarily driven by expected growth in emerging markets 

development of new flavors and fragrance compounds is driven by a variety of sources including requests from our customers who are in need of a specific flavor or fragrance for use in a new or modified consumer product or as a result of internal initiatives stemming from our consumer insights program our product development team works in partnership with our scientists and researchers to optimize the consumer appeal of the flavor or fragrance it then becomes a collaborative process among our researchers our product development team and our customers to perfect the flavor or fragrance so that it is ready to be included in the final consumer product 

2017  overview 

our 25 largest customers accounted for 50  of total sales in 2017  this percentage has remained fairly constant for several years sales to our largest customer across all enduse categories accounted for 11  to 12 of our sales for each of the last three fiscal years a key factor for commercial success is inclusion on our strategic customers’ core supplier lists which provides opportunities to win new business we are on the core supplier lists of a large majority of our global and strategic customers within fragrances and flavors 

sales in 2017  increased 9  on both a reported and currency neutral basis which excludes the effects of changes in currency with the effects of acquisitions contributing approximately 5 to both the reported and currency neutral growth rates flavors achieved reported sales growth of 9  and currency neutral sales growth of 10  with the effect of acquisitions contributing approximately 5  to both reported and currency neutral growth rates fragrances achieved sales growth of 9  on both a reported and currency basis in 2017  with the effect of acquisitions contributing approximately 5  to both reported and currency neutral growth rates sales growth excluding acquisitions was driven by new win performance net of losses in both flavors and fragrance compounds additionally fragrance ingredients sales were up 8  on a both a reported basis and 

  33 

currency neutral basis principally driven by higher volumes overall our 2017  results continued to be driven by our strong emerging market presence that represented 48  of total sales and experienced 4  reported and currency neutral growth in 2017  from a geographic perspective north america noam europe africa and middle east eame greater asia ga and latin america la all delivered sales growth on a consolidated basis in 2017  led by noam 

on january 17 2017 we completed the acquisition of fragrance resources inc fragrance resources a privatelyheld fragrance company with facilities in germany north america france and china for approximately €1434 million  approximately 1519 million  the acquisition is expected to strengthen our fragrances market position in north america and germany on april 7 2017 we completed the acquisition of columbia phytotechnology llc dba powderpure powderpure a processor of allnatural food ingredients for approximately 546 million  powderpure was acquired to expand our expertise and product offerings of clean label solutions within the flavors business these acquisitions did not have a material impact on our 2017 results 

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” that significantly revised the us tax code effective january 1 2018 by among other things lowering the corporate income tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35 to a flat 21 and establishing a modified territorial system requiring a mandatory deemed repatriation tax on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries the tax act impacted our fourth quarter consolidated results of operations and is expected to continue to impact our consolidated results of operations in future periods in particular the transition to the new territorial tax system required the company to record a onetime tax or “toll charge” which resulted in a provisional incremental tax expense of 1006 million principally related to previously unremitted earnings on nonus subsidiaries the cash portion of the toll charge will be payable in installments over 8 years beginning in 2018 in addition the reduction of the us corporate tax rate resulted in a provisional net deferred tax expense of 386 million related to the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets as a result of the reduction in the corporate income tax rate 

2017  sales by business unit

financial performance overview 

reported and currency neutral sales for 2017  increased 9  yearoveryear including approximately 5  growth from acquisitions we continue to benefit from our diverse portfolio of enduse product categories and geographies and had sales growth in all four regions and in all categories both flavors and fragrances benefited from new win performance net of losses and the effect of acquisitions exchange rate variations did not have a material impact on revenue in 2017 the effect of exchange rates can vary by business and region depending upon the mix of sales by country as well as the relative percentage of local sales priced in us dollars versus local currencies we saw currency neutral sales growth during each quarter of 2017  

we believe that market conditions and the macroeconomic environment will continue to be volatile in many markets in 2018  but that overall there will be slight improvements as compared to recent years pressures from increasing costs and the impact of a supply chain disruption related to a key ingredient manufactured by basf and used in the flavors and fragrances industry are expected to reduce our currency neutral operating profit growth in 2018  the basf supply chain disruption is not expected to be resolved until the second half of 2018 

on a longterm basis we expect that sales growth for the industry will generally be in line with the underlying assumptions that support our longterm strategic goals albeit with some risk in the near term given the continuing global economic uncertainty we believe changing social habits resulting from increased disposable income improved focus on personal health and wellness awareness should help drive growth of our consumer product customers’ businesses 

gross margin decreased 140  basis points bps yearoveryear included in 2017  was 159 million  of acquisitionrelated inventory stepup costs 110 million  relating to an fda mandated product recall 18 million  of costs associated with operational improvement initiatives and 05 million  of integration related costs compared to 76 million  of acquisitionrelated inventory stepup costs 24 million  of costs related to operational improvement initiatives and 07 million  of costs related to accelerated depreciation included in cost of goods sold included in 2016  excluding these items adjusted gross margin decreased 80  bps compared to the prior year period the decrease was principally driven by higher costs including higher claim expense and higher input costs offset by the favorable impact of productivity initiatives volumes were slightly higher but were offset by slightly unfavorable mix 

during 2017  the raw material cost environment continued its recent upward trend we believe that in 2018 we will continue to see higher prices on certain categories such as vanilla and citrus increases related to turpentine and oil derived materials and higher costs on a key ingredient due to the basf supply disruption related to one of our key ingredients we continue to seek improvements in our margins through operational performance cost reduction efforts and mix enhancement 

operating profit increased 141 million  to 5814 million   171  of sales in 2017  compared to 5674 million   182  of sales in 2016  included in 2017  were restructuring and other charges of 197 million  acquisitionrelated costs of 204 million  110 million  relating to an fda mandated product recall reserve for payment of a tax assessment related to commercial rent for prior periods of 53 million  integration related costs of 42 million  pension settlement charges of 28 million  operational improvement initiative costs of 18 million  additional charge related to litigation settlement of 10 million  and gain on sale of fixed assets of 02 million  included in 2016  were net legal chargescredits of 485 million  acquisitionrelated costs of 122 million  gain on sale of fixed assets of 78 million  operational improvement initiative costs of 24 million  and restructuring and other charges net of 03 million  excluding these charges adjusted operating profit was 6474 million   190  of sales for 2017  versus 6230 million   200  of sales for 2016  the decrease in operating profit as a percentage of sales was principally driven by lower gross margins in 2017 foreign currency changes had a favorable impact on operating profit of 1  in 2017 and an unfavorable impact on operating profit of approximately 2  in 2016  

cash flows from operations were 3908 million  or 115  of sales in 2017  as compared to cash flows from operations of 5501 million  or 177  of sales during 2016  the decrease in operating cash flows in 2017  as compared to 2016  is principally related to the impact of increased core working capital requirements trade receivables inventories and accounts payable and due to payments on legal claims along with payments for severance integration and acquisition costs 

  35 

our capital spend was 1290 million   38  of sales during 2017  in light of our requirement to begin relocating our fragrance facility in china and the ongoing construction of a new facility in india we expect that capital spending in 2018  will be about 45 5  of sales net of potential grants and other reimbursements from government authorities  during 2017 we received approximately 150 million in payments related to the future relocation of our zhejiang ingredients plant and total payments for which are expected to approximate up to 50 million

2017 productivity program 

on february 15 2017 we announced that we were adopting a multiyear productivity program designed to improve overall financial performance provide flexibility to invest in growth opportunities and drive longterm value creation in connection with this program we expect to optimize our global footprint and simplify the companys organizational structures globally in connection with this initiative the company expects to incur cumulative pretax cash charges of between 30  35 million  consisting primarily of 24  26 million  in personnelrelated costs and an estimated 6 million  in facilityrelated costs such as lease termination and integrationrelated costs   

the company recorded 206 million  of charges related to personnelrelated costs in 2017 with the remainder of the personnelrelated and other costs expected to be recognized by the end of 2018 the company made payments of 140 million   related to severance in 2017 the overall charges were split approximately evenly between flavors and fragrances this initiative is expected to result in the reduction of approximately 370  members of the company’s global workforce including acquired entities in various parts of the organization   

amortization of acquisitionrelated intangibles 

amortization expenses increased to 347 million  in 2017  compared to 238 million  in 2016  the increase of 109 million  is principally due to the acquisitions of fragrance resources and powderpure in 2017 as well as recognizing a full year of amortization in 2017 from the acquisition of david michael as compared to 2016

global expenses 

global expenses represent corporate and headquarterrelated expenses which include legal finance human resources and rd and other administrative expenses that are not allocated to an individual business unit in 2017  global expenses were 632 million  compared to 485 million  during 2016  the increase was principally driven by lower gains on our cash flow hedging program and higher incentive compensation costs 

interest expense 

in 2017  interest expense increased 124 million  to 654 million  compared to 530 million  in 2016  reflecting the impact of our issuance of senior notes  2017 in the second quarter of 2017 average cost of debt was 41 for the 2017  period compared to 38 in 2016  

other income expense net 

other income net increased approximately 116 million  to 210 million  of income in 2017  versus 94 million  of income in 2016  the increase was largely driven by gains on foreign currency of approximately 13 million in the current year versus approximately 5 million in the prior year as well as proceeds from certain life insurance policies of approximately 4 million in 2017

income taxes 

the effective tax rate was 449  in 2017  as compared to 227  in 2016  excluding 1392 million  related to the us tax reform legal chargescredits net of 04 million  acquisition related costs of 65 million  gain on sale of assets of 01 million  operational improvement initiative costs of 05 million  restructuring and other charges net of 55 million  fda mandated product recall costs of 39 million  uk pension settlement charge of 05 million  tax assessment of 19 million  and integration related costs of 13 million  the adjusted effective tax rate for 2017  was 207  for 2016  the adjusted tax rate was 238  excluding 171 million  41 million  06 million  and 01 million  of tax benefits associated with pretax legal chargescredits acquisitionrelated costs operational improvement initiatives and restructuring related costs respectively as well as a 27 million  tax charge related to the gain on sale of property the yearoveryear reduction principally reflects the reversal of certain valuation allowances on us state deferred taxes 

us tax reform 

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” that significantly revised the us tax code effective january 1 2018 by among other things lowering the corporate income tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35 to a flat 21 limiting deductibility of interest expense and performance based incentive compensation transitioning to a territorial system and creating new taxes associated with global operations 

the tax act impacted our  consolidated results of operations during the 2017 fourth quarter and is expected to continue to impact our  consolidated results of operations in future periods in particular the transition to the new territorial tax system required  us to record a onetime tax or “toll charge” which resulted in a provisional incremental tax expense of 1006 million  principally related to previously unremitted earnings on nonus subsidiaries the cash portion of the toll charge will be payable in installments over 8  years beginning in 2018 in addition the reduction of the us corporate tax rate resulted in a provisional net deferred tax expense of   386 million  related to the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets as a result of the reduction in the corporate income tax rate given the significant complexity of the tax act anticipated guidance from the us treasury about implementing the tax act and the potential for additional guidance from the sec or the fasb the company’s provisional charge may be adjusted during 2018 and is expected to be finalized no later than the fourth quarter of 2018 other provisions of the tax act that impact future tax years are still being assessed any material revisions in the companys computations could adversely affect its cash flows and results of operations 

based on our current assessment and understanding of the tax act and the company’s current global operating structure the company believes its effective tax rate will be approximately 21 in 2018 the impact of the tax act may differ from this estimate due to among other things changes in interpretations and assumptions the company has made additional guidance that may be issued by the taxing authorities as well as operating andor structural changes that the company may take as a result of the tax act 

adoption of asc topic 740 

effective january 1 2017 the company prospectively applied new accounting guidance which required all excess tax benefitsdeficiencies be recognized as income tax expensebenefit in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income this change resulted in a 33 million  benefit to income tax expense for the year ended december 31 2017 for 2016 benefits of 53 million were recognized in equity

global expenses 

global expenses represent corporate and headquarterrelated expenses which include legal finance human resources and rd and other administrative expenses that are not allocated to an individual business unit in 2016 global expenses were 485 million compared to 282 million during 2015 the increase is principally driven by lower gains on our cash flow hedging program and higher incentive compensation costs 

interest expense 

in 2016 interest expense increased 69 million to 530 million compared to 461 million in 2015 reflecting the impact of borrowings under the euro senior notes  2016 average cost of debt was 38 for the 2016 period compared to 45 in 2015 

other income expense net

the effective tax rate was 227 in 2016 as compared to 222 in 2015 excluding 171 million 41 million 06 million and 01 million of tax benefits associated with pretax legal chargescredits net acquisitionrelated costs operational improvement initiatives and restructuring related costs respectively as well as a 27 million tax charge related to the gain on sale of property the adjusted tax rate for 2016 was 238 excluding 62 million 23 million and 03 million of tax benefits associated with pretax acquisitionrelated costs restructuring charges and operational improvement initiatives respectively a 105 million tax settlement received in 2015 due to favorable tax rulings in spain and another jurisdiction as well as a 29 million charge related to the reversal of the previously recorded provision for the spanish capital tax case the adjusted tax rate for 2015 was 242 the yearoveryear reduction reflects a benefit from lower cost of repatriation and mix of earnings which were partially offset by loss provisions 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash and cash equivalents 

we had cash and cash equivalents of 3680 million  at december 31 2017  compared to 3240 million  at december 31 2016  of which 2866 million of the balance at december 31 2017  was held outside the united states cash balances held in foreign jurisdictions are in most circumstances available to be repatriated to the united states 

effective utilization of the cash generated by our international operations is a critical component of our strategy we regularly repatriate in the form of dividends from our nonus subsidiaries a portion of our current year earnings to fund financial obligations in the us these repatriations of current year earnings totaled 1922 million 1345 million and 1846 million in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively the tax act includes a mandatory onetime tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries and as a result all previously unremitted earnings for which no us deferred tax liability had been accrued have now been subject to us tax and will not be subject to additional us tax when repatriated we may repatriate a portion of these accumulated earnings of nonus subsidiaries to fund financial obligations in the us but we do not expect to incur any significant additional taxes related to such amounts 

cash flows from operating activities 

operating cash flows in 2017  were 3908 million  compared to 5501 million  in 2016  and 4673 million  in 2015  the decrease in operating cash flows in 2017  as compared to 2016  was principally related to the impact of increased core working capital requirements trade receivables inventories and accounts payable and due to payments on legal claims along with severance integration and acquisition costs 

working capital current assets less current liabilities totaled 113 billion  at yearend 2017  compared to 071 billion  at december 31 2016  this increase in working capital of 4171 million  primarily reflected increases in accounts receivable and inventory offset by an increase in accounts payable and a decrease in short term borrowings as compared to the prior year in the prior years current liabilities included a 250 million liability related to the maturity of a payment due on one of our senior notes 

additionally we continue to sell certain accounts receivable on a nonrecourse basis to unrelated financial institutions under “factoring” agreements that are sponsored solely and individually by certain customers we believe that participating in the factoring programs strengthens our relationships with these customers and provides operational efficiencies we estimate that as a result of participating in the programs there was a beneficial impact on cash provided by operations of approximately 76 million  34 million  and 34 million  in 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively the cost of participating in these programs was immaterial to our results in all periods 

cash flows used in investing activities 

net investing activities in 2017  utilized 2999 million  compared to 3555 million  and 5772 million  in 2016  and 2015  respectively the decrease in cash paid for investing activities was primarily driven by lower payments for acquisitions in 2017 we acquired fragrance resources and powderpure for approximately 1375 million  net of cash acquired and 542 million  net of cash acquired respectively in addition to a purchase price adjustment of 07 million related to david michael in 2017 in 2016 we paid approximately 2375 million  for the acquisition of david michael and in 2015 we paid approximately 1885 million  net of cash acquired and 3051 million  net of cash acquired for ottens flavors and lucas meyer respectively 

additions to property plant and equipment were 1290 million  1264 million  and 1010 million  in 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively net of grants and other reimbursements from government authorities these investments largely arise from 

  45 

our ongoing focus to align our manufacturing facilities with our customer demand primarily in emerging markets and new technology consistent with our strategy 

in light of our requirement to begin relocating our fragrance facility in china and the ongoing construction of a new facility in india we expect that capital spending in 2018  will be about 45 5  of sales net of potential grants and other reimbursements from government authorities   

cash flows used in financing activities 

net financing activities in 2017  utilized 426 million  compared to 344 million  and 1650 million  in 2016  and 2015  respectively the increase in outflow of cash used in financing activities in 2017  as compared to 2016  principally reflected slightly higher debt repayments in 2017 offset by lower treasury share repurchases the decrease in outflow of cash used in financing activities in 2016 as compared to 2015 principally reflected borrowings under the euro senior notes  2016 which were offset by repayment of our senior notes  2006 as well as higher dividend payments and treasury share repurchases in 2016 

at december 31 2017  we had 16392 million  of debt outstanding compared to 13254 million  outstanding at december 31 2016  

we paid dividends totaling 2061 million  1849 million  and 1589 million  in 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively the cash dividend declared per share in 2017  2016  and 2015  was 266  240  and 206  respectively 

in december 2012 the board of directors authorized a 2500 million  share repurchase program which commenced in the first quarter of 2013 in august 2015 the board of directors approved an additional 250 million share repurchase authorization and extension through december 31 2017 based on the total remaining amount of 561 million  available under the amended repurchase program as of october 31 2017 the board of directors reapproved on november 1 2017 a 2500 million  share repurchase authorization and extension for a total value of 3000 million available under the program  based on the total remaining amount of 295 million  available under the repurchase program approximately 19 million  shares or 24  of shares outstanding based on the market price and shares outstanding as of december 31 2017  could be repurchased under the program as of december 31 2017  the purchases will be made from time to time on the open market or through private transactions as market and business conditions warrant repurchased shares will be placed into treasury stock the ultimate level of purchases will be a function of the daily purchase limits established in the preapproved program according to the share price at that time 

capital resources 

operating cash flow provides the primary source of funds for capital investment needs dividends paid to shareholders and debt service repayments we anticipate that cash flows from operations and availability under our existing credit facilities are sufficient to meet our investing and financing needs we regularly assess our capital structure including both current and longterm debt instruments as compared to our cash generation and investment needs in order to provide ample flexibility and to optimize our leverage ratios we believe our existing cash balances are sufficient to meet our debt service requirements 

during the second quarter of 2017 we acquired powderpure for approximately 542 million  net of cash acquired which was funded from existing resources 

during the first quarter of 2017 we acquired fragrance resources for approximately 1375 million  net of cash acquired which was funded from existing resources 

during the fourth quarter of 2016 we acquired david michael for approximately 2375 million  net of cash acquired which was funded from existing resources

during the second quarter of 2015 we acquired ottens flavors for approximately 1885 million  net of cash acquired which was funded from existing resources 

credit facility and senior notes 

we supplement shortterm liquidity with access to capital markets mainly through bank credit facilities and issuance of commercial paper 

  46 

commercial paper 

commercial paper issued by the company generally has terms of 90 days or less as of december 31 2017  and 2016  there was no commercial paper outstanding the revolving credit facility is used as a backstop for the companys commercial paper program the maximum amount of commercial paper outstanding during 2017  and 2016  was 1075 million  and 65 million  respectively 

credit facility 

there are two tranches under the credit facility tranche a of the facility is available to borrowers in us dollars euros swiss francs japanese yen and british sterling in an aggregate amount up to an equivalent of approximately 5641 million  with a sublimit of 25 million  for swing line borrowings tranche b of the facility is available to borrowers in us dollars euros swiss francs japanese yen and british sterling in an aggregate amount up to an equivalent of approximately 3859 million  with sublimits of €50 million  and 25 million  for swing line borrowings 

the credit facility is available for general corporate purposes borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at rate of libor corresponding to the term of the loan plus a margin currently 1125 bps linked to the companys credit rating the credit facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants including the requirement for us to maintain at the end of each fiscal quarter a ratio of net debt for borrowed money to adjusted ebitda in respect of the previous 12month period of not more than 350 to 1 based on this ratio at december 31 2017  our covenant compliance would provide overall borrowing capacity of 15304 million  

as of december 31 2017  we had no of borrowings under our revolving credit facility the amount which we are able to draw down on under the facility is limited by financial covenants as described in more detail below our draw down capacity on the facility was 950 million  at december 31 2017  see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the credit facility 

at december 31 2017  and 2016  we were in compliance with all financial and other covenants including the net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio at december 31 2017  our net debtadjusted ebitda 1 ratio was 159  to 1 as defined by the credit facility well below the financial covenants of existing outstanding debt failure to comply with the financial and other covenants under our debt agreements would constitute default and would allow the lenders to accelerate the maturity of all indebtedness under the related agreement if such acceleration were to occur we would not have sufficient liquidity available to repay the indebtedness we would likely have to seek amendments under the agreements for relief from the financial covenants or repay the debt with proceeds from the issuance of new debt or equity andor asset sales if necessary we may be unable to amend the agreements or raise sufficient capital to repay such obligations in the event the maturities are accelerated

contractual obligations 

at december 31 2017  we had contractual payment obligations due within the time periods as specified in the following table   



 

 the table above does not include 382 million  of the total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions and approximately 41 million  of associated accrued interest due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential cash flows we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the amount and period in which the remaining liabilities might be paid 

critical accounting policies and use of estimates 

our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements as disclosed in note 1 the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and accompanying disclosures these estimates are based on management’s best judgment of current events and actions that we may undertake in the future actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates 

those areas requiring the greatest degree of management judgment or deemed most critical to our financial reporting involve 

the periodic assessment of potential impairment of goodwill  we currently have goodwill of 12 billion  in assessing the potential for impairment of goodwill management uses the most current actual and forecasted operating data available and current marketbased assumptions in accordance with the criteria in financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc 350 the company has identified four reporting units 1 flavors 2 fragrance compounds 3 fragrance ingredients and 4 cosmetic actives ingredients these reporting units were determined based on the level at which the performance is measured and reviewed by segment management 

  49 

the company performs an annual goodwill impairment test for the flavors fragrance compounds fragrance ingredients and cosmetic actives ingredients reporting units by assessing the fair value of the reporting units based on discounted cash flows if a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value the company will record an impairment charge based on that difference and the impairment charge will be limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit in january 2017 the fasb issued an amendment to the goodwill impairment guidance which eliminates step 2 from the goodwill impairment test effective fiscal year 2017 the company adopted the new guidance and no longer performs the annual goodwill impairment test using the twostep approach the company completed its annual goodwill impairment test as of november 30   2017  which indicated no impairment of goodwill as the estimated fair values substantially exceeded the carrying values of each of these reporting units 

the periodic assessment of potential impairment of finitelived intangible assets  we currently have intangible assets of 4158 million  the company reviews longlived assets for impairment when events or changes in business conditions indicate that their full carrying value may not be recovered an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by an asset or group of assets is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists if assets are determined to be impaired the loss is measured based on an estimate of fair value using various valuation techniques including a discounted estimate of future cash flows 

the analysis and evaluation of income taxes  we account for taxes under the asset and liability method under this method deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax return bases of assets and liabilities a valuation allowance is recognized if based on the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized the assessment of the need for a valuation allowance requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future earnings reversal of existing temporary differences and available tax planning strategies if actual experience differs from these estimates and assumptions the recorded deferred tax asset may not be fully realized resulting in an increase to income tax expense in our results of operations 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes we first determine whether it is “more likely than not” that we would sustain our tax position if the relevant tax authority were to audit the position with full knowledge of all the relevant facts and other information for those tax positions that meet this threshold we measure the amount of tax benefit based on the largest amount of tax benefit that we have a greater than 50 chance of realizing in a final settlement with the relevant authority those tax positions failing to qualify for initial recognition are recognized in the first interim period in which they meet the more likely than not standard this evaluation is made at the time that we adopt a tax position and whenever there is new information and is based upon management’s evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date we maintain a cumulative risk portfolio relating to all of our uncertainties in income taxes in order to perform this analysis but the evaluation of our tax positions requires significant judgment and estimation in part because in certain cases tax law is subject to varied interpretation and whether a tax position will ultimately be sustained may be uncertain we do not currently believe that any of our pending tax assessments even if ultimately resolved against us would have a material impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” that significantly revised the us tax code effective january 1 2018 by among other things lowering the corporate income tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35  to a flat 21  limiting deductibility of interest expense and performance based incentive compensation transitioning to a territorial system and creating new taxes associated with global operations 

the tax act impacted the companys  consolidated results of operations during the 2017 fourth quarter and is expected to continue to impact its  consolidated results of operations in future periods in particular the transition to the new territorial tax system required  the company to record a onetime tax or “toll charge” which resulted in a provisional incremental tax expense of 1006 million  principally related to previously unremitted earnings on nonus subsidiaries the cash portion of the toll charge will be payable in installments over 8  years beginning in 2018 in addition the reduction of the us corporate tax rate resulted in a provisional net deferred tax expense of   386 million  related to the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets as a result of the reduction in the corporate income tax rate given the significant complexity of the tax act anticipated guidance from the us treasury about implementing the tax act and the potential for additional guidance from the sec or the fasb the company’s provisional charge may be adjusted during 2018 and is expected to be finalized no later than the fourth quarter of 2018 other provisions of the tax act that impact future tax years are still being assessed any material revisions in the companys computations could adversely affect its cash flows and results of operations

the evaluation of potential litigation and environmental liabilities where changing circumstances rules and regulations require regular reassessment of related practices and anticipated costs  we are subject to certain legal claims regarding products and other matters as well as environmentalrelated matters significant management judgment is involved in determining when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the extent to which it can be reasonably estimated 

we regularly assess potential liabilities with respect to all legal claims based on the most recent available information in consultation with outside counsel we have engaged on our behalf to handle the defense of such matters to the extent a liability is considered to be probable and reasonably estimable we recognize a corresponding liability if the reasonably estimated liability is a range we recognize that amount considered most likely or in the absence of such a determination the minimum reasonably estimated liability to the extent such claims are covered by various insurance policies we separately evaluate the right to recovery and estimate the related insurance claim receivable management judgments involve determination as to whether a liability has been incurred the reasonably estimated amount of that liability and any potential insurance recovery 

we regularly evaluate potential environmental exposure in terms of total estimated cost and the viability of other potentially responsible parties “prp’s” associated with our exposure recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress and additional information becomes available critical management assumptions relate to expected total costs to remediate and the financial viability of prp’s to share such costs 

determination of the various assumptions employed in the valuation of pension and retiree health care expense and associated obligations  amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined from actuarial valuations inherent in such valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets discount rates at which the liabilities could be settled rates of increase in future compensation levels mortality rates and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore affect expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods 

we consider a number of factors in determining and selecting assumptions for the overall expected longterm rate of return on plan assets we consider the historical longterm return experience of our assets the current and expected allocation of our plan assets and expected longterm rates of return we derive these expected longterm rates of return with the assistance of our investment advisors we base our expected allocation of plan assets on a diversified portfolio consisting of domestic and international equity securities fixed income real estate and alternative asset classes 

we consider a variety of factors in determining and selecting our assumptions for the discount rate at december 31 for the us plans the discount rate was based on the internal rate of return for a portfolio of high quality bonds rated aa or higher by either moody’s or standard  poors with maturities that are consistent with the projected future benefit payment obligations of the plan for the nonus plans the discount rates were determined by region and are based on high quality longterm corporate bonds consideration has been given to the duration of the liabilities in each plan when selecting the bonds to be used in determining the discount rate the rate of compensation increase for all plans and the medical cost trend rate for the applicable us plans are based on plan experience 

with respect to the us plans the expected rate of return on plan assets was determined based on an asset allocation model using the current target allocation real rates of return by asset class and an anticipated inflation rate the target asset allocation consists of approximately 20  in equity securities and 80  in fixed income securities the plan has achieved a compounded annual rate of return of 59 over the previous 20 years at december 31 2017  the actual asset allocation for the us plan was 1  cash and cash equivalents 28  in equity securities and 71  in fixed income securities 

the expected rate of return for the nonus plans employs a similar set of criteria adapted for local investments inflation rates and in certain cases specific government requirements the target asset allocation for the nonus plans consists of approximately 40  – 70  in fixed income securities 15  – 40  in equity securities 5  – 20  in real estate and 5  – 10  in alternative investments at december 31 2017  the actual asset allocation for the nonus plan was 40  in fixed income investments 27  in equity investments 4  in real estate investments 4  in cash and cash equivalents and 25  in alternative investments 

  51 

changes in pension and other postemployment benefits and associated expenses may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions the impact that a 025 decrease in the discount rate or a 1 change in the medical cost trend rate would have on our pension and other postemployment benefit expense as applicable is as follows 



the effect of a 1 increase in the medical cost trend rate would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and the annual postretirement expense by approximately 03 million  and less than 01 million  respectively a 1 decrease in the rate would decrease the obligation and expense by approximately 04 million  and less than 01 million  respectively 

the ongoing assessment of the valuation of inventory given the large number of natural ingredients employed the quality of which may be diminished over time  we hold a majority of our inventory as raw materials providing the greatest degree of flexibility in manufacture and use as of december 31 2017  we maintained 50  of our inventory as raw materials materials are evaluated based on shelf life known uses and anticipated demand based on forecasted customer order activity and changes in productsales mix management policy provides for an ongoing assessment of inventory with adjustments recorded when an item is deemed to be slow moving or obsolete 

we believe that we have considered relevant circumstances that we may be currently subject to and the financial statements accurately reflect our best estimate of the impact of these items in our results of operations financial condition and cash flows for the years presented we have discussed the decision process and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 

new accounting standards 

in february 2018 fasb issued amendments to the income statement  reporting comprehensive income guidance which allow a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the tax act in addition to requiring certain disclosures about stranded tax effects this guidance is effective for periods beginning after december 15 2018 with an election to adopt early the company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements

in october 2016 the fasb issued authoritative guidance which allows for the immediate recognition of current and deferred income tax impact on intraentity asset transfers excluding inventory the company adopted this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 and accordingly recorded a cumulativeeffect adjustment to retained earnings that reduced other assets and adjusted deferred income taxes by a net amount of approximately 34 million  

in august 2016 the fasb issued authoritative guidance which requires changes to the classification of certain activities within the statement of cash flows this guidance will be effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15 2017 early adoption will be permitted for all entities the company does not expect this adoption to have a significant impact on its consolidated statement of cash flows   

in june 2016 the fasb issued authoritative guidance which requires issuers to measure expected credit losses for financial assets based on historical experience current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts as such an entity will use forwardlooking information to estimate credit losses the guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2019 including interim periods within those fiscal years early adoption is permitted for the fiscal years beginning after december 15 2018 including interim periods within those fiscal years the company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance may have on its consolidated financial statements but does not expect this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements   

in march 2016 the fasb issued authoritative guidance which requires changes to several aspects of the accounting for sharebased payment transactions including the treatment of income tax consequences classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification of certain items on the statement of cash flows this guidance was effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15 2016 the company adopted this standard during the first quarter of 2017 the standard requires that employee taxes paid when an employer withholds shares be presented in the consolidated statement of cash flows as a financing activity instead of an operating activity the company adopted this change retrospectively the adoption resulted in an 118 million  134 million  and 229 million  reclassification from net cash provided by operating activities to net cash provided by financing activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows as of december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively in addition the standard requires that excess tax benefits presented in the consolidated statement of cash flows be classified as an operating activity instead of a financing activity the company adopted this change retrospectively the adoption resulted in a 33 million  47 million  and 121 million  reclassification from net cash provided by financing activities to net cash provided by operating activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows as of december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively 

the standard also requires all excess tax benefitsdeficiencies be recognized as income tax expensebenefit in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income this guidance has been applied prospectively this change resulted in a 33 million benefit to income tax expense for the year ended december 31 2017 for 2016 benefits of 53 million were recognized in equity 

in february 2016 the fasb issued authoritative guidance which requires changes to the accounting for leases the new guidance establishes a new lease accounting model that requires entities to record assets and liabilities related to leases on the balance sheet for certain types of leases the guidance will be effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15 2018 the company expects to adopt this guidance effective december 30 2018 and that the adoption of this guidance will result in significant increases to assets and liabilities on its consolidated balance sheet the company is still evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated statement of comprehensive income the company has begun to evaluate the nature of its leases and has compiled preliminary analysis of the type and location of its leases the company expects that the significant portion of its leases will relate to property but with additional leases in existence that relate to vehicles and machinery   

revenue recognition  adoption of asc 606 

in may 2014 the fasb issued authoritative guidance that provides for a comprehensive model to be used in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers asc topic 606 revenue from contracts with customers the “revenue standard” under the revenue standard revenue will be recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services 

  53 

this guidance is applicable to all entities and is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15 2017 companies have the option to apply the new guidance under a retrospective approach to each prior reporting period presented or a modified retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially applying the new guidance recognized at the date of initial application within the consolidated balance sheet the company has determined that it will adopt this guidance using the modified retrospective approach   

the company has substantially completed the evaluation of the revenue standard including updates to it issued by the fasb and has adopted the revenue standard on december 30 2017 the first day of the company’s 2018 fiscal year a cumulative catch up adjustment will be recorded as of that date   

the company creates and manufactures flavors and fragrances approximately 90 of products principally flavors compounds and fragrance compounds are customized to customer specifications and have no alternative use other than sale to the specific customer “compounds products” the remaining revenue is derived largely from fragrance ingredient products that generally are commodity products with alternative uses and not customized “ingredients products”   

the company’s evaluation is substantially complete and was comprised of i a detailed review of a large number of documents including master service supply rebate and other similar agreements and purchase orders ii interviews with regional finance and business personnel on general issues such as the nature of its larger customer relationships the nature of potential regional variations rebates and other price adjustments upfront costs and shipping terms and specific issues identified during the review such as consignment minimum order quantities etc and iii consultation with legal counsel with respect to the nature of various terms within the contracts   

based on this evaluation with respect to the vast majority of the company’s contracts for compounds products the company will recognize revenue at a point in time specifically revenue will be recognized upon transfer of control of the product as the company does not have an “enforceable right to payment for performance to date” as set out in section 606102527 c of the standard with respect to a small number of compounds products customers the company has determined that it does have an “enforceable right to payment for performance to date” as set out in section 606102527 c of the revenue standard for contracts where an enforceable right to payment exists the company will recognize revenue over time using the output method the calculation of the required cumulative catch up adjustment is in the process of being finalized 

it was determined that no adjustment will be required with respect to revenue related to ingredients products as such products generally have alternative uses and on which the company does not have an enforceable right to payment at all times during the manufacturing process   

in completing its assessment of the adoption of the revenue standard the company elected to combine the shipment of goods with their manufacture to account for both shipment and manufacture as a single performance obligation   

nongaap financial measures 

the company uses nongaap financial operating measures in this form 10k including i currency neutral sales which eliminates the effects that result from translating its international sales in us dollars ii adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross margin which exclude operational improvement initiatives  acquisition related costs  integration related costs  restructuring and other charges net  and fda mandated product recall  iii adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating margin which excludes operational improvement initiatives  acquisition related costs  integration related costs  legal chargescredits net  tax assessment  restructuring and other charges net  gain on sale of assets  fda mandated product recall  and uk pension settlement charges  iv adjusted selling and administrative expenses which excludes operational improvement initiatives  acquisition related costs  integration related costs  legal chargescredits net  tax assessment  restructuring and other charges net  and uk pension settlement charges  and v adjusted effective tax rate which excludes operational improvement initiatives  acquisition related costs  integration related costs  legal chargescredits net  tax assessment  restructuring and other charges net  gain on sale of assets  cta realization  fda mandated product recall  uk pension settlement charges  and us tax reform  the company also provides the nongaap measures adjusted ebitda which excludes certain specified items and noncash items as set forth in the company’s debt agreements and net debt which is adjusted for deferred gain on interest rate swaps and cash and cash equivalents solely for the purpose of providing information on the extent to which the company is in compliance with debt covenants contained in its debt agreements 

we have included each of these nongaap measures in order to provide additional information regarding our underlying operating results and comparable yearoveryear performance such information is supplemental to information presented in accordance with gaap and is not intended to represent a presentation in accordance with gaap in discussing our historical and expected future results and financial condition we believe it is meaningful for investors to be made aware of and to be assisted in a better understanding of on a periodtoperiod comparable basis financial amounts both including and excluding 

  54 

these identified items as well as the impact of exchange rate fluctuations we believe such additional nongaap information provides investors with an overall perspective of the periodtoperiod performance of our business in addition management internally reviews each of these nongaap measures to evaluate performance on a comparative periodtoperiod basis in terms of absolute performance trends and expected future performance with respect to our business a material limitation of these nongaap measures is that such measures do not reflect actual gaap amounts we compensate for such limitations by using these measures as one of several metrics including gaap measures these nongaap measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we operate on a global basis and are exposed to currency fluctuation related to the manufacture and sale of our products in currencies other than the us dollar the major foreign currencies involve the markets in the european union great britain mexico brazil china india indonesia australia and japan although all regions are subject to foreign currency fluctuations versus the us dollar we actively monitor our foreign currency exposures in all major markets in which we operate and employ a variety of techniques to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations including foreign currency hedging activities 

we have established a centralized reporting system to evaluate the effects of changes in interest rates currency exchange rates and other relevant market risks our risk management procedures include the monitoring of interest rate and foreign exchange exposures and hedge positions utilizing statistical analyses of cash flows market value and sensitivity analysis however the use of these techniques to quantify the market risk of such instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of their accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions for the year ended december 31 2017  the company’s exposure to market risk was estimated using sensitivity analyses which illustrate the change in the fair value of a derivative financial instrument assuming hypothetical changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts with the objective of reducing exposure to cash flow volatility associated with foreign currency receivables and payables and with anticipated purchases of certain raw materials used in operations these contracts the counterparties to which are major international financial institutions generally involve the exchange of one currency for a second currency at a future date and have maturities not exceeding twelve months the gain or loss on the hedging instrument and services is recorded in earnings at the same time as the transaction being hedged is recorded in earnings at december 31 2017  the company’s foreign currency exposures pertaining to derivative contracts exist with the euro japanese yen british pound australian dollar and indonesian rupiah based on a hypothetical decrease or increase of 10 in the applicable balance sheet exchange rates primarily against the us dollar the estimated fair value of the company’s foreign currency forward contracts would increase or decrease by approximately 70 million however any change in the value of the contracts real or hypothetical would be significantly offset by a corresponding change in the value of the underlying hedged items 

we have also used nonus dollar borrowings and foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the foreign currency exposures of our net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries primarily in the european union based on a hypothetical decrease or increase of 10 in the value of the us dollar against the euro the estimated fair value of the company’s foreign currency forward contracts would change by approximately 2 million however any change in the value of the contracts real or hypothetical would be significantly offset by a corresponding change in the value of the underlying hedged items 

we use derivative instruments as part of our interest rate risk management strategy the derivative instruments used are comprised of fixed to variable rate interest rate swaps based on the libor plus an interest mark up and interest rate swaps to hedge the anticipated issuance of fixed rate debt the notional amount interest payment and maturity date of the swaps match the principal interest payment and maturity date of the related debt and the swaps are valued using observable benchmark rates based on a hypothetical decrease or increase of one percentage point in libor the estimated fair value of the company’s interest rate swaps would change by less than 4 million 

at december 31 2017  the fair value of our fixed rate debt was 18 billion  based on a hypothetical decrease of 10 in interest rates the estimated fair value of the company’s fixed debt would increase by 27 million 

we purchase certain commodities such as natural gas electricity petroleum based products and certain crop related items we generally purchase these commodities based upon market prices that are established with the vendor as part of the purchase process in general we do not use commodity financial instruments to hedge commodity prices

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures and changes in internal control over financial reporting 

our chief executive officer and chief financial officer with the assistance of other members of our management have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this form 10k based on such evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of the end of the period covered by this form 10k 

we have established controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the commission’s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to management including the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that there have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting

we principally compete in the flavors and fragrances market which is part of a larger market that supplies a wide variety of ingredients and compounds used in consumer products the broader market includes large multinational companies and smaller regional and local participants that supply products such as seasonings texturizers spices enzymes certain foodrelated commodities fortified products and cosmetic ingredients the global market for flavors and fragrances has expanded consistently primarily as a result of an increase in demand for and an increase in the variety of consumer products containing flavors and fragrances in 2016  t he flavors fragrances and cosmetic actives and functional ingredients market in which we compete was estimated by management to be approximately 200 billion  and is forecasted to grow approximately 23  by 2020  primarily driven by expected growth in emerging markets 

in 2016 we achieved sales of approximately 31 billion  making us one of the top four companies in the global flavors and fragrances subsegment of the broader consumer products ingredients and compounds market within the flavors and fragrances subsegment of this broader market the top four companies represent approximately twothirds of the total estimated sales we believe that our diversified business platform expansive geographic coverage broad product portfolio and global and regional customer base positions us to achieve longterm growth as the flavors and fragrances markets expand

vision 2020 strategy 

during 2016 we continued to execute against the four pillars of our vision 2020 strategy originally announced in 2015 which focuses on building differentiation and accelerating growth 

   

 

 

   

our product offerings 

flavors 

flavors are the key building blocks that impart taste experiences in food and beverage products and as such play a significant role in determining consumer preference for the end products in which they are used as a leading creator of flavor compounds we help our customers deliver on the promise of delicious and healthy foods and drinks that appeal to consumers while we are a global leader our flavors business is more regional in nature with different formulas that reflect local taste preferences we create our flavors in our regional creative centers which allow us to satisfy local taste preferences while also helping to ensure regulatory compliance and production standards we develop thousands of different flavors and taste offerings for our customers most of which are tailormade we continually develop new formulas in order to meet changing consumer preferences and customer needs 

our flavors compounds are ultimately used by our customers in the following four enduse categories of consumer goods 1 savory  for use in soups sauces condiments prepared meals meat and poultry potato chips and other savory snacks 2 beverages  for use in juice drinks carbonated beverages flavored waters and spirits 3 sweet   for use in bakery products candy chewing gum and cereal and 4 dairy for use in all dairy products such as yogurt ice cream and cheese and other products that have a creamy flavor we also offer a wide range of quality vanilla extracts and a variety of flavor solutions that build on our understanding of vanilla 

we continue to build upon our strengths and to focus on addressing industry trends that will allow us to differentiate ourselves from our competitors and deliver accelerated growth consistent with our vision 2020 strategy these trends include 



  4 

“clean label” products products that do not include any artificial ingredients as a result of these trends we believe our vision 2020 strategy’s focus on innovation including our modulation technology delivery systems and our naturals and proprietary ingredients will help our customers address changing consumer demands 

 

fragrances 

we are a global leader in the creation of fragrance compounds that are integral elements in the world’s finest perfumes and bestknown consumer products within fabric care home care personal wash hair care and toiletries our fragrance business is a vertically integrated operation originating with the development in our research laboratories of naturals synthetic and proprietary molecules and innovative delivery systems progressing to our manufacturing facilities that produce these ingredients in a consistent highquality and costeffective manner and transitioning to our creative centers and application laboratories where our perfumers partner with our customers to create unique fragrance compounds for use in a variety of enduse products 

by providing our fragrance development teams with an extensive portfolio of innovative highquality and effective ingredients to support their creativity we are able to provide our customers with a unique identity for their brands these ingredients or fragrance compounds can then be combined with our innovative delivery systems including our proprietary encapsulation technology which consists of individual fragrance droplets coated with a protective polymetric shell to deliver superior fragrance performance throughout a products lifecycle these delivery systems are key differentiators in the growth of our consumer fragrance compounds 

our fragrances business derives revenue from two sources fragrance compounds and ingredients 

fragrance compounds   fragrance compounds are unique and proprietary combinations of multiple ingredients that are ultimately used by our customers in their consumer goods our creative and commercial teams within fragrance compounds are organized into two broad categories fine fragrances and consumer fragrances 

 

 

ingredients  fragrance ingredients consists of active and functional ingredients that are used internally and sold to third parties including customers and competitors for use in preparation of compounds while the principal role of our fragrance ingredients facilities is to support our fragrance compounds business we utilize our excess manufacturing capacity to manufacture and sell certain fragrance ingredients to third parties we believe that this business allows us to leverage our fixed costs while maintaining the security of supply for our perfumers and ultimately our customers fragrance ingredients available for sale to third parties include innovative ingredients that leverage our manufacturing experience as well as a limited amount of costcompetitive commodity ingredients as our fragrance compounds business grows we expect that the percentage of capacity allocated to the production of fragrance ingredients for sale to third parties may decrease fragrance ingredients also includes our cosmetic active and functional ingredients which provide biologists and cosmetic chemists with innovative solutions to address cosmetic challenges such as skin aging and hair protection 

  5 

with approximately 1300 separate fragrance and active and functional cosmetic ingredients  excluding our recent acquisition of fragrance resources  plus additional botanicals and delivery systems we believe we are a leader in the industry with the breadth of our product portfolio 

consistent with our vision 2020 strategy fragrances continues to build upon our strengths to differentiate ourselves from our competitors address evolving consumer demands and deliver accelerated growth specifically we intend to focus on 

1 consumer demand for natural and organic products  increased demand for natural ingredients is a primary driver of future growth in fine fragrances we believe that our inhouse naturals operations led by laboratoire monique rémy “lmr” in grasse france are industry leading in the processing of quality materials and offer decades of experience understanding natural products and perfecting the process of transforming naturals such as narcissus jasmine and blackcurrant bud into pure absolutes that retain the unique fragrance of their origin our objective is to expand our naturals capabilities by offering our clients naturals and proprietary ingredients 

2 transparency in labeling  as consumers worldwide seek to require transparency in labeling our customers will progressively seek to differentiate their products through proprietary molecules a major emphasis of our research program is the creation of new proprietary molecules and ingredients 

3 delivery systems we continue to invest in our delivery system technologies including expansion of our marketleading encapsulation technology which we believe will allow us to differentiate our products and those of our customers our encapsulation technology extends controls the release of and increases aromas in a variety of consumer products we have expanded our portfolio to offer multifunctional delivery systems with cosmetic actives that work to enhance skin penetration protect the active against interactions with other ingredients provide longlasting release facilitate formulation of challenging ingredients and allow a bettertargeted action 

research and product development process 

consumer insights 

we believe that the first step to creating a unique scent or taste experience begins with gaining insight into the consumer by developing a deep understanding of what consumers value and prefer we are better able to focus our rd and creative efforts our quest to bring new exciting and winning ideas to our clients begins with insight into the consumer 

our consumer insight and marketing teams work tirelessly interpreting trends monitoring product launches analyzing quantitative market data and conducting several hundred thousand consumer interviews annually our sensory experts direct research programs exploring topics such as fragrance performance the psychophysics of sensory perception including chemesthetic properties such as warming cooling and tingling the genetic basis for flavor and fragrance preference and the effects of aromas on mood performance health and wellbeing 

based on this information we develop innovative programs to evaluate potential products that enable us to understand the emotional connections between a prospective product and the consumer we believe this ability to pinpoint the likelihood of a product’s success translates into stronger brand equity resulting in increased returns and greater market share gains for our customers as well as iff 

research and development 

we consider our rd infrastructure to be one of our key competencies and we focus and invest substantial resources in the research and development of new and innovative compounds formulas and technologies and the application of these to our customers’ products we spend approximately 8  of our sales on the research development and implementation of new molecules compounds and technologies that help our customers respond to changing consumer preferences using the knowledge gained from our consumer insights program we strategically focus our resources around key rd platforms that address consumer needs or preferences or anticipate future preferences by aligning our resources around these platforms we ensure the proper support and focus for each program so that it can be further developed and eventually accepted for commercial application as a result of this investment we have been granted 315  patents in the united states since 2000 including 9  in 2016  and we have developed many unique molecules and delivery systems for our customers that are used as the foundations of successful flavors and fragrances around the world 

we principally conduct our rd activities in union beach new jersey where we employ scientists and application engineers who collaborate with our five other rd centers around the world to support the 



  6 

 as of december 31 2016  we employed about 1500  people globally in rd activities we spent 2543 million  2461 million  and 2536 million  or approximately 82  81  and 82  of sales in 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively on rd activities 

our ingredients research program discovers molecules found in natural substances and creates new molecules that are subsequently tested for their sensorial value to broaden our offerings of natural innovative and unique products we seek collaborations with research institutions and other companies throughout the world we have established a number of such collaborations to strengthen our innovation pipeline we may also consider acquiring companies that could provide access to new technologies consistent with our vision 2020 strategy 

the development of new and customized flavor and fragrance compounds is a complex process calling upon the combined knowledge of our scientists flavorists and perfumers scientists from various disciplines work in project teams with flavorists and perfumers to develop flavor and fragrance compounds with consumer preferred performance characteristics the development of new flavor and fragrance compounds requires i an indepth knowledge of the flavor and fragrance characteristics of the various ingredients we use ii an understanding of how the many ingredients in a consumer product interact and iii the creation of controlled release and delivery systems to enhance flavor and fragrance performance to facilitate this process we have a scientific advisory board comprised of five leading scientists that provide external perspectives and independent feedback on our rd initiatives 

creative application 

we also have a network of 70  creative centers and application laboratories including 14  acquired since 2014 around the world where we create or adapt the basic flavors or fragrances that we have developed in the rd process to commercialize for use in our customers’ consumer products our global creative teams consist of perfumers fragrance evaluators and flavorists as well as marketing consumer insights and technical application experts from a wide range of cultures and nationalities in close partnership with our customers’ product development groups our creative teams create the sensorial experiences that our customers are seeking in order to satisfy consumer demands in each of their markets 

development of new flavors and fragrances is driven by a variety of sources including requests from our customers who are in need of a specific flavor or fragrance for use in a new or modified consumer product or as a result of internal initiatives stemming from our consumer insights program our product development team works in partnership with our scientists and researchers to optimize the consumer appeal of the flavor or fragrance a collaborative process between our researchers our product development team and our customers then follows to perfect the flavor or fragrance so that it is ready to be included in the final consumer product 

in addition to creating new flavors and fragrances our researchers and product development teams advise customers on ways to improve their existing products by adjusting or substituting current ingredients with more readily accessible or less expensive materials or by modifying the current ingredients to produce an enhanced yield this often results in creating a better value proposition for our customers 

our flavor and fragrance compound formulas are treated as trade secrets and remain our proprietary asset our business is not materially dependent upon any individual patent trademark or license 

supply chain 

we strive to provide our customers with consistent quality products on a timely and costeffective basis by managing all aspects of the supply chain from raw material sourcing through manufacturing quality assurance regulatory compliance and distribution 

procurement 

we use both natural and synthetic ingredients in our compounds we purchase approximately 9000 different raw materials from about 2500 domestic and international suppliers and distributors  excluding our recent acquisitions of david michael and fragrance resources  approximately half of the materials we purchase are naturals or croprelated items and the other half are synthetics and chemicals natural ingredients are derived from flowers fruits and other botanical products as well as from animal products they contain varying numbers of organic chemicals that are responsible for the fragrance or flavor of the natural product natural products are purchased in processed or semiprocessed form some are used in 

  7 

compounds in the state in which they are purchased and others are used after further processing natural products together with various chemicals are also used as raw materials for the manufacture of synthetic ingredients by chemical processes our flavor products also include extracts and seasonings derived from various fruits vegetables nuts herbs and spices as well as microbiologicallyderived ingredients we manufacture most of our synthetic ingredients for use in our fragrance compounds as well as for sale to others 

in order to ensure our supply of raw materials achieve favorable pricing and provide timely transparency regarding inflationary trends to our customers we continue to be focused on i implementing a forwardbuy strategy ii entering into supplier relationships to gain access to supplies that we do not have iii implementing indexed pricing iv reducing the complexity of our formulations and v evaluating whether it is more profitable to buy or make an ingredient we are also concentrating on local country sourcing with our own procurement professionals 

manufacturing and distribution 

we have 42  manufacturing sites including 11  acquired since 2014  around the world that support more than 35000  products our major manufacturing facilities are located in the united states the netherlands spain great britain indonesia turkey brazil mexico china india and singapore our supply chain initiatives in developing markets are focused on increasing capacity and investments in key technologies within our more mature markets we tend to focus on consolidation and cost optimization as well as implementing new technologies in addition to our own manufacturing facilities we develop relationships with third parties including contract manufacturing organizations that permit us to expand access to the technologies capabilities and capacity that we need to better serve our customers 

based on the regional nature of the flavors business and the concerns regarding the transportability of raw materials we have established smaller manufacturing facilities in our local markets that are focused on local needs products within the fragrances business are typically composed of compounds that are more stable and more transportable around the world consequently we have fewer manufacturing facilities within our fragrances business which produce compounds and ingredients for global distribution 

in 2016 we continued to invest in our facilities we completed construction of a new manufacturing facility in jakarta indonesia in addition to a new capital project to construct a second flavors manufacturing facility in china we also expect to complete relocation of a fragrance ingredients facility in china in the second half of 2017 we also continue to assess our existing footprint and manufacturing capabilities that serve the indian and mexican markets in addition we are evaluating a request to relocate a second fragrance ingredients plant in china 

sustainability 

as a leading global creator of flavors and fragrances for a wide variety of consumer products sustainability has been an important part of how we do business our sustainability strategy is centered on three main aspects positive principles regenerative products and sensational people 

 in 2016 we released the firstever cradle to cradle certified fragrance puravita a proof of concept for an innovative approach to sustainable fragrance creation and launched the flavor and fragrance industry’s firstever onsite wind turbine at our tilburg netherlands manufacturing facility also we entered into vetiver together a unique partnership to enhance the livelihoods of farmers in haiti while securing our supply chain in addition we were identified for the second consecutive year as a global leader for our actions and strategies regarding climate change and awarded a leadership position on the climate “a” list by the cdp 

governmental regulation 

we develop produce and market our products in a number of jurisdictions throughout the world and are subject to federal regional and local legislation and regulations in each of the various countries our flavor and many of our fragrance products are intended for the food beverage and pharmaceutical industries which are subject to strict quality and regulatory standards as a result we are required to meet these strict standards which in recent years have become increasingly 

  8 

stringent 

our products and operations are subject to regulation by governmental agencies in each of the markets in which we operate these agencies include 1 the food and drug administration and equivalent international agencies that regulate flavors and other ingredients in consumer products 2 the environmental protection agency and equivalent international agencies that regulate our manufacturing facilities 3 the occupational safety and health administration and equivalent international agencies that regulate the working conditions in our manufacturing research laboratories and creative centers 4 local and international agencies that regulate trade and customs 5 the drug enforcement administration and other local or international agencies that regulate controlled chemicals that we use in our operations and 6 the chemical registrationnotification authorities that regulate chemicals that we use in or transport to the various countries in which we manufacture andor market our products we have seen an increase in registration and reporting requirements concerning the use of certain chemicals in a number of countries such as registration evaluation authorisation and restriction of chemicals  reach regulations in the european union 

in addition we are subject to various rules relating to health work safety and the environment at the local and international levels in the various countries in which we operate our manufacturing facilities throughout the world are subject to environmental standards relating to air emissions sewage discharges the use of hazardous materials waste disposal practices and cleanup of existing environmental contamination in recent years there has been a significant increase in the stringency of environmental regulation and enforcement of environmental standards and the costs of compliance have risen significantly a trend we expect will continue in the future 

competition 

the flavors and fragrances market is part of a larger market which supplies a variety of ingredients and components that consumer products companies utilize in their products the broader market includes large multinational companies or smaller regional and local participants which supply products such as seasonings texturizers spices enzymes certain foodrelated commodities fortified products and cosmetic ingredients 

the market for flavors and fragrances is highly competitive based on annual sales our main competitors consist of 1 the three other large global flavor and fragrance manufacturers givaudan firmenich and symrise 2 midsized companies 3 numerous local and regional manufacturers and 4 consumer product companies who may develop their own flavors or fragrances we together with the other top three companies represent approximately twothirds of the total estimated sales in the global flavors and fragrances subsegment of the broader market 

we believe that our ability to compete successfully in the flavors and fragrances submarket is based on 1 our understanding of consumers 2 innovation arising from the creative skills of our perfumers and flavorists and the technological advances resulting from our research and development activities 3 our ability to create products which are tailormade for our customers’ needs 4 developing strong customer intimacy and 5 driving efficiency in all that we do 

large multinational customers and increasingly midsized customers may limit the number of their suppliers by placing some on “core lists” giving them priority for development and production of their new or modified products 

to compete more successfully in this environment we must make continued investments in customer relationships and tailor our research and development efforts to anticipate customers’ needs provide effective service and secure and maintain inclusion on certain “core lists” 

employee relations 

at december 31 2016  we had approximately 6900  employees worldwide of whom approximately 1800  are employed in the united states we believe that relations with our employees are good

risk factors 

tableend

we routinely encounter and address risks in conducting our business some of these risks may cause our future results to be different  sometimes materially different  than we presently anticipate below are material risks we have identified that could adversely affect our business how we react to material future developments as well as how our competitors and customers react to those developments could also affect our future results 

our business is highly competitive and if we are unable to compete effectively our sales and results of operations will suffer 

the market for flavors and fragrances is highly competitive we face vigorous competition from companies throughout the world including multinational and specialized flavor fragrance and cosmetic ingredients companies as well as consumer product companies who may develop their own flavors fragrances or cosmetic ingredients in the flavors industry we also face increasing competition from ingredient suppliers that have expanded their portfolios to include flavor offerings some of our competitors specialize in one or more of our product subsegments while others participate in many of our product subsegments in addition some of our global competitors may have greater resources than we do or may have proprietary products that could permit them to respond to changing business and economic conditions more effectively than we can consolidation of our competitors may exacerbate these risks with our recent entry into cosmetic ingredients we may face greater competitionrelated risks in this market than with our core historic flavor and fragrances businesses 

competition in our business is based on innovation product quality regulatory compliance pricing quality of customer service the support provided by marketing and application groups and understanding of consumers it is difficult for us to predict the timing scale and success of our competitors’ actions in these areas the discovery and development of new flavors and fragrance compounds and ingredients protection of the company’s intellectual property and development and retention of key employees are important issues in our ability to compete in our business increased competition by existing or future competitors including aggressive price competition could result in the potential loss of substantial sales or create the need for us to reduce prices or increase spending and this could have an adverse impact on sales and profitability 

during 2016 our 25 largest customers accounted for 52  of our sales and sales to our largest customer accounted for 12  of our sales in each of the last three fiscal years disruption of sales to this customer or any of our other large customers for an extended period of time could adversely affect our business or financial results 

large multinational customers and increasingly midsized customers are unilaterally limiting the number of their suppliers or rationalizing the number of products that they offer to increase their margins and profitability as part of these initiatives these

customers are creating “core lists” of suppliers and giving these “core lists” suppliers priority for new or modified products recently these customers are making inclusion on their “core lists” contingent upon a supplier providing more favorable commercial terms which may adversely affect our margins these and other profitability initiatives being pursued by our customers reduce the market opportunity for which we compete and subject the volume and pricing of the remaining suppliers to downward pressure to compete more successfully in this environment we must continue to make investments in customer relationships and tailor product research and development in order to anticipate customers’ needs deliver supplies that contribute to our customers’ profitability provide effective customer service and offer competitive costinuse solutions to secure and maintain inclusion on certain “core lists” and our share of our customers’ purchases if we are unable to do so it could adversely impact our future results of operations 

we may not be able to successfully identify and complete sufficient acquisitions to meet our vision 2020 strategy and even if we are able to do so we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions 

as part of our vision 2020 strategy we intend to add between 500 million and 10 billion of sales growth through acquisitions within the flavors and fragrances industries and adjacencies during 2015 we completed two acquisitions which align with this strategic objective acquiring ottens flavors a flavor supplier and developer and lucas meyer cosmetics a developer manufacturer and marketer of cosmetic active and functional ingredients in 2016 we acquired david michael a privatelyheld flavors company and announced our acquisition of fragrance resources a privatelyheld fragrance company 

identifying suitable acquisition candidates can be difficult timeconsuming and costly and we may not be able to identify suitable candidates or complete acquisitions in a timely manner on a costeffective basis or at all 

even if we complete an acquisition we may not realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisition our recent acquisitions have required and any similar future transactions may also require significant efforts and expenditures including with respect to integrating the acquired business with our historical business we may encounter unexpected difficulties or incur unexpected costs in connection with acquisition activities and integration efforts which include 

 if any of our acquisitions do not perform as anticipated for any of the reasons noted above or otherwise there could be a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

the interruption or failure of key information technology systems or a loss of data malicious attack or other breach of security of our information technology systems may have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business subject us to increased operating costs damage our reputation and expose us to litigation 

we rely on information technology systems including some managed by thirdparty providers to conduct business and support our business processes including product formulas product development sales order processing production distribution internal communications and communications with third parties throughout the world processing transactions summarizing 

  12 

and reporting results of operations complying with regulatory tax or legal requirements and collecting and storing customer supplier employee and other stakeholder information these systems may be susceptible to disruptions or outages due to fire floods power loss telecommunications failures natural disasters cyber attacks failed upgrades or other similar events or due to the poor performance of thirdparty providers effective response to such disruptions will require effort and diligence on the part of our employees and thirdparty providers to avoid any adverse impact to our business in addition our systems and proprietary data stored electronically may be vulnerable to computer viruses cybercrime computer hacking and similar information security breaches which in turn could result in the unauthorized release or misuse of confidential or proprietary information about our business including but not limited to the trade secrets upon which we rely to protect our proprietary fragrance and flavor formulations employees or customers and disrupt our operations depending on their nature and scope these threats could potentially lead to improper use of our systems and networks manipulation and destruction of data or product noncompliance the occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our sales subject us to increased operating costs damage our reputation and expose us to litigation or regulatory proceedings 

the industries in which our flavors customers operate are expanding and becoming increasingly decentralized and if we andor our customers are unable to adjust our operating results and future growth may be adversely affected 

our customers include large food and beverage companies which operate in highly competitive industries and rely on continued consumer demand for their products in recent years many of our customers have faced growing competition from midsize regional companies and companies focused on nicheproduct categories driving and accelerating product innovation consequently the food and beverage industry is expanding and becoming increasingly decentralized if our customers fail to adequately address the challenges pertaining to this expansion and decentralization of business it may adversely affect their operations or financial performance and could have a corresponding material adverse effect on our flavors business if our global customers’ market shares continue to erode and we are unable to gain market share with small and midsized customers in this evolved environment our operating results and future growth could be adversely affected 

we may not successfully develop and introduce new products that meet our customers’ needs which may adversely affect our results of operations 

our ability to differentiate ourselves and deliver growth in line with our vision 2020 strategy largely depends on our ability to successfully develop and introduce new products and product improvements that meet our customers’ needs and ultimately appeal to consumers innovation is a key element of our ability to develop and introduce new products we cannot be certain that we will be successful in achieving our innovation goals such as the development of new molecules new and expanded delivery systems and other technologies we currently spend approximately 8  of our sales on research and development however such investments may only generate future revenues to the extent that we are able to develop products that meet our customers’ specifications can be delivered at an acceptable cost and are accepted by the targeted consumer market furthermore there may be significant lag times from the time we incur rd costs to the time that these rd costs may result in increased revenue consequently even when we “win” a project our ability to generate revenues as a result of these investments is subject to numerous customer economic and other risks that are outside of our control including delays by our customers in the launch of a new product the level of promotional support for the launch poor performance of our thirdparty vendors anticipated sales by our customers not being realized or changes in market preferences or demands or disruptive innovations by competitors 

increasing awareness of health and wellness are driving changes in the consumer products industry and if we are unable to react in a timely and costeffective manner our results of operations and future growth may be adversely affected 

we must continually anticipate and react in a timely and costeffective manner to changes in consumer preferences and demands including changes in demand driven by increasing awareness of health and wellness and demands for transparency with respect to product ingredients consumers especially in developed economies such as the united states and western europe are shifting away from products containing artificial ingredients to “all natural” healthier alternatives in addition there has been a growing demand by consumers nongovernmental organizations and to a lesser extent governmental agencies to provide more transparency in product labeling and our customers have been taking steps to address this demand including by voluntarily providing productspecific ingredients disclosure these two trends could affect the types and volumes of our flavors and fragrances that our customers include in their product offerings if we are unable to react to or anticipate these trends in a timely and costeffective manner our results of operations and future growth may be adversely affected 

  13 

we may not succeed in establishing and maintaining collaborations joint ventures or partnerships and such arrangements may not lead to development or commercialization of products which may limit our ability to execute our vision 2020 strategy and adversely affect our future growth 

from time to time and in line with our vision 2020 strategy we may evaluate and enter into collaborations joint ventures or partnerships to enhance our research and development efforts our ability to generate revenues from such collaborations will depend on our partners’ abilities and efforts to successfully perform the functions assigned to them in these arrangements the process of establishing and maintaining collaborative relationships is difficult timeconsuming to negotiate document and implement we may not be successful in our efforts to establish and implement collaborations or other alternative arrangements should we choose to enter into such arrangements and the terms of the arrangements may not be favorable to us additionally collaborations may not lead to development or commercialization of products in the most efficient manner or at all if we are unable to establish and maintain collaborative relationships on acceptable terms or to successfully transition terminated collaborative agreements it could limit our ability to execute our vision 2020 strategy and adversely affect our future growth 

we have made investments in and continue to expand our business into emerging markets which exposes us to certain risks 

as part of our growth strategy we have increased our presence in emerging markets by expanding our manufacturing presence sales organization and product offerings in these markets and we expect to continue to expand our business in these markets in addition to the currency and international operation risks described below our operations in these markets may be subject to a variety of other risks emerging markets typically have a consumer base with limited or fluctuating disposable income and customer demand in these markets may fluctuate accordingly as a result decrease in customer demand in emerging markets may have an adverse effect on our ability to execute our growth strategy in addition emerging markets may have weak legal systems which may affect our ability to enforce our intellectual property and contractual rights exchange controls unstable governments and privatization or other government actions that may affect taxes subsidies and incentive programs and the flow of goods and currency in conducting our business we move products from one country to another and may provide services in one country from a subsidiary located in another country accordingly we are vulnerable to abrupt changes in customs and tax regimes that may have significant negative impacts on our financial condition and operating results 

the impact of currency fluctuation or devaluation in the international markets in which we operate may negatively affect our results of operations 

we have significant operations outside the united states the results of which are reported in the local currency and then translated into united states dollars at applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements the exchange rates between these currencies and the united states dollar have fluctuated and will continue to do so in the future changes in exchange rates between these local currencies and the united states dollar will affect the recorded levels of sales profitability assets andor liabilities for example the weakening of the euro and several emerging market currencies in 2016 resulted in approximately 14 million impact on operating profit versus 2015 additionally volatility in currency exchange rates may adversely impact our financial condition cash flows or liquidity although we employ a variety of techniques to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations including sourcing strategies and a limited number of foreign currency hedging activities we cannot guarantee that such hedging and risk management strategies will be effective and our results of operations could be adversely affected 

our international operations are subject to regulatory political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues cash flows or financial position 

we operate on a global basis with manufacturing and sales facilities in the united states europe africa the middle east latin america and greater asia during 2016 76  of our net sales were to customers outside the united states and we intend to continue expansion of our international operations as a result our business is increasingly exposed to risks inherent in international operations these risks which can vary substantially by location include the following 



  14 

 the occurrence of any one or more of these factors could increase our costs and adversely affect our results of operations 

volatility and challenging economic conditions may adversely affect demand for consumer products using flavors and fragrances and this may have a negative impact on our operating results and future growth 

our flavors and fragrance compounds and ingredients are components of a wide assortment of global consumer products throughout the world historically demand for consumer products using flavors and fragrances was stimulated and broadened by changing social habits and consumer needs population growth an expanding global middleclass and general economic growth especially in emerging markets the global economy has experienced significant recessionary pressures and declines in consumer confidence and economic growth while some segments of the global economy appear to be recovering the ongoing global recessionary economic environment in europe has and may in the near future increase unemployment and underemployment decrease salaries and wage rates increase inflation or result in other marketwide cost pressures that will adversely affect demand for consumer products in both developed and emerging markets 

in addition growth rates in the emerging markets have moderated from previous levels reduced consumer spending may cause changes in our customer orders including reduced demand for our flavors and fragrances or order cancellations for example recent challenging economic conditions in china and latin america which culminated in the weakening of the chinese yuan brazilian real and argentinian peso have undermined consumer confidence and resulted in our customers throughout the emerging markets taking a more cautious approach to managing their inventory 

the timing of placing of orders and the amounts of these orders are generally at our customers discretion customers may cancel reduce or postpone orders with us on relatively short notice significant cancellations reductions or delays in orders by customers could affect our quarterly results 

it is currently anticipated that these challenging economic conditions will continue during 2017 to the extent that the volatility in global economic conditions continues our sales profitability and overall operating results could be adversely affected 

our success depends on attracting and retaining talented people within our business significant shortfalls in recruitment or retention could adversely affect our ability to compete and achieve our strategic goals 

attracting developing and retaining talented employees including our perfumers and flavorists is essential to the successful delivery of our products and success in the marketplace competition for these employees can be intense the ability to attract and retain talented employees is critical in the development of new products and technologies which is an integral component of our growth strategy however we may not be able to attract and retain such employees in the future if we experience significant shortfalls in recruitment or retention our ability to effectively compete with our competitors and to grow our business could be adversely affected 

  15 

failure to comply with environmental protection laws may cause us to close relocate or operate one or more of our plants at reduced production levels which could adversely affect our operating results and future growth 

our business operations and properties are subject to extensive and increasingly stringent federal state local and foreign laws and regulations pertaining to protection of the environment including air emissions sewage discharges the use of hazardous materials waste disposal practices and cleanup of existing environmental contamination failure to comply with these laws and regulations or any future changes to them may result in significant consequences to us including the need to close or relocate one or more of our production facilities administrative civil and criminal penalties liability for damages and negative publicity if we are unable to meet production requirements we can lose customer orders which can adversely affect our future growth or we may be required to make incremental capital investments to ensure supply for example in 2015 chinese authorities notified us of compliance issues pertaining to the emission of odors from several of our plants in china and consequently we invested approximately 65 million in odorabatement equipment at these facilities and have located a site for construction of a second flavors manufacturing facility in china with an estimated cost of 45 million we are also in discussions with the chinese government concerning the relocation of a second ingredients plan in china such idling of facilities or production modifications has caused or may cause customers to seek alternate suppliers due to concerns regarding supply interruptions and these customers may not return or may order at reduced levels even once issues are remediated if these noncompliance issues reoccur in china or occur or in any other jurisdiction we may lose business and may be required to incur capital spending above previous expectations close a plant or operate a plant at significantly reduced production levels on a permanent basis and our operating results and cash flows from operations may be adversely affected 

our ongoing optimization of our manufacturing facilities may not be as effective as we anticipate and we may fail to realize the expected cost savings and increased efficiencies 

as part of our strategy we seek to enhance our manufacturing efficiency and align our geographic manufacturing footprint with our expectations of future growth and technology needs many of our facilities are located in close proximity to our customers in order to minimize both our customers’ and our own costs however we may not have sufficient demand to utilize all of our production capacity and may be required to ship excess products to other regions in which we operate which will increase our costs and decrease our margins to operate more efficiently and control costs from time to time we also execute rationalization activities which include manufacturing facility consolidations for example we are in the midst of relocating our ingredients facility in hangzhou china constructing a new facility in indonesia and expect to begin relocating a second ingredients facility in china we have also initiated a study regarding our existing footprint and manufacturing capabilities that serve the indian market the spending associated with these projects may result in capital spending above previous expectations our ability to realize anticipated cost savings synergies and revenue enhancements from these activities may be affected by a number of factors and may pose significant risks including 

 furthermore our rationalization and consolidation actions may not be as effective as we anticipate and we may fail to realize the cost savings we expect from these actions actual charges costs and adjustments due to these activities may vary materially from our estimates and these activities may require cash and noncash integration and implementation costs or charges in excess of budgeted amounts which could offset any such savings and other synergies and therefore could have an adverse effect on our margins 

volatility and increases in the price of raw materials energy and transportation could harm our profits 

we use many different raw materials for our business including essential oils extracts and concentrates derived from fruits vegetables flowers woods and other botanicals animal products raw fruits organic chemicals and petroleumbased chemicals historically we have experienced a considerable amount of price volatility in natural products that represent approximately half of our raw material purchases and in 2016 we experienced increases in the prices of certain naturals 

  16 

including citrus and vanilla availability and pricing of these natural products can be impacted by crop size and quality weather alternative land use and other factors which we cannot control 

if we are unable to increase the prices to our customers of our fragrance or flavor products to offset raw material and other input cost increases or if we are unable to achieve cost savings to offset such cost increases we could fail to meet our cost expectations and our profits and operating results could be adversely affected increases in prices of our products to customers may lead to declines in volume and we may not be able to accurately predict the volume impact of price increases which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

similarly commodities and energy prices are subject to significant volatility caused by market fluctuations supply and demand currency fluctuations production and transportation disruptions and other world events as we source many of our raw materials globally to help ensure quality control if the cost of energy shipping or transportation increases and we are unable to pass along these costs to our customers our profit margins would be adversely affected furthermore increasing our prices to our customers could result in longterm sales declines or loss of market share if our customers find alternative suppliers or choose to reformulate their consumer products to use fewer ingredients which could have an adverse longterm impact on our results of operations 

to mitigate our sourcing risk we maintain strategic stock levels for critical items however if we do not accurately estimate the amount of raw materials that will be used for the geographic region in which we will need these materials our margins could be adversely affected 

our reliance on a limited base of suppliers may result in a disruption to our business and may adversely affect our financial results 

for certain raw materials we rely on a limited number of suppliers and we may not have readily available alternatives if we are unable to maintain our supplier arrangements and relationships and are unable to obtain the quantity quality and price levels needed for our business or if any of our key suppliers becomes insolvent or experiences other financial distress or if we are unable to identify new suppliers in response to any of these events we could experience disruptions in production and our financial results could be adversely affected 

if we are unable to maintain the integrity of our raw materials supply chain and finished goods or fail to comply with applicable regulations it may result in regulatory noncompliance litigation costs customer loss and harm to our reputation all of which may adversely impact sales and our results of operations 

the development manufacture and sale of our products are subject to various regulatory requirements in each of the countries in which our products are developed manufactured and sold in addition we are subject to product safety and compliance requirements established by the industry or similar oversight bodies we use a variety of strategies methodologies and tools to i identify current product standards ii assess relative risks in our supply chain that can impact product integrity iii monitor internal and external performance and iv test raw materials and finished goods to minimize the likelihood of product or process noncompliance 

gaps in our operational processes could adversely affect the quality of our finished products and result in a regulatory noncompliance event if a product noncompliance event were to go undetected it could subject us to customer claims recalls penalties litigation costs and settlements remediation costs or loss of sales as our flavors and fragrance compounds and ingredients are used in many products intended for human use or consumption these consequences would be exacerbated if we or our customer did not identify the defect before the product reaches the consumer and there was a resulting impact at the consumer level such a result could lead to potentially large scale adverse publicity negative effects on consumers health recalls and potential consumer litigation in addition if we do not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification from suppliers or other third parties or if insurance or indemnification is not available the liability relating to product or possible thirdparty claims arising from defective products could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations furthermore adverse publicity about our products or our customers products that contain our ingredients including concerns about product safety or similar issues whether real or perceived could harm our reputation and result in an immediate adverse effect on our sales and customer relationships as well as require us to utilize significant resources to rebuild our reputation 

a disruption in our operations or our supply chain could adversely affect our business and financial results 

as a company engaged in research and development manufacturing and distribution on a global scale we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities including industrial accidents environmental events strikes and other labor disputes 

  17 

disruptions in supply chain or information systems disruption or loss of key research or manufacturing sites product quality control safety licensing requirements and other regulatory issues as well as natural disasters international conflicts terrorist acts and other external factors over which we have no control while we have research and development and manufacturing facilities throughout the world many of these facilities are extremely specialized and certain of our facilities are the sole source of a specific ingredient or product if our research and development activities or the manufacturing of ingredients or products were disrupted the cost of relocating or replacing these activities or reformulating these ingredients or products may be substantial which could result in production or development delays or otherwise have an adverse effect on our margins operating results and future growth 

our performance may be adversely impacted if we are not successful in managing our inventory andor working capital balances 

we evaluate our inventory balances of materials based on shelf life expected sourcing levels known uses and anticipated demand based on forecasted customer order activity and changes in our productsales mix efficient inventory management is a key component of our business success financial returns and profitability to be successful we must maintain sufficient inventory levels and an appropriate productsales mix to meet our customers’ demands without allowing those levels to increase to such an extent that the costs associated with storing and holding other inventory adversely impact our financial results if our buying decisions do not accurately predict sourcing levels customer trends or our expectations about customer needs are inaccurate we may have to take unanticipated markdowns or impairment charges to dispose of the excess or obsolete inventory which can adversely impact our financial results additionally we believe excess inventory levels of raw materials with a short shelf life in our manufacturing facilities subjects us to the risk of increased inventory shrinkage if we are not successful in managing our inventory balances and shrinkage our results of and cash flows from operations may be negatively affected 

we sell certain accounts receivable on a nonrecourse basis to unrelated financial institutions under “factoring” agreements that are sponsored solely and individually by certain customers the cost of participating in these programs was immaterial to our results in all periods should we choose not to participate or if these programs were no longer available it could reduce our cash flows from operations in the period in which the arrangement ends 

we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act or similar us or foreign antibribery and anticorruption laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate 

the global nature of our business the significance of our international revenue and our focus on emerging markets create various domestic and local regulatory challenges and subject us to risks associated with our international operations the us foreign corrupt practices act or fcpa and similar antibribery and anticorruption laws and regulations in other countries generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or for other commercial advantage in addition us public companies are required to maintain records that accurately and fairly represent their transactions and have an adequate system of internal accounting controls under the fcpa us companies may be held liable for the corrupt actions taken by directors officers employees agents or other strategic or local partners or representatives as such if we or our intermediaries fail to comply with the requirements of the fcpa or similar legislation governmental authorities in the united states and elsewhere could seek to impose substantial civil andor criminal fines and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation operating results and financial condition 

we operate or may pursue opportunities in some jurisdictions such as china india brazil and africa which pose potentially elevated risks of fraud or corruption or increased risk of internal control issues in certain jurisdictions compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices from time to time we have conducted and will conduct internal investigations of the relevant facts and circumstances control testing and compliance reviews and take remedial actions when appropriate to help ensure that we are in compliance with applicable corruption and similar laws and regulations detecting investigating and resolving actual or alleged violations of the fcpa or similar laws is expensive and could consume significant time and attention of our senior management we could be subject to inquiries or investigations by government and other regulatory bodies any allegations of noncompliance with the fcpa or similar laws could have a disruptive effect on our operations in such jurisdiction over the near term including interruptions of business or loss of thirdparty relationships which may negatively impact our results of operations or financial condition any determination that our operations or activities are not in compliance with the fcpa or similar laws could expose us to severe criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions significant fines termination of necessary licenses and permits and penalties or other sanctions that may harm our business and reputation 

our ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights 

  18 

we rely on patents and trade secrets to protect our intellectual property rights we often rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary fragrance and flavor formulations as this does not require us to publicly file information regarding our intellectual property from time to time a third party may claim that we have infringed upon or misappropriated their intellectual property rights or a third party may infringe upon or misappropriate our intellectual property rights we could incur significant costs in connection with legal actions to assert our intellectual property rights against third parties or to defend ourselves from third party assertions of invalidity infringement or misappropriation or other claims any settlement or adverse judgment resulting from such litigation could require us to obtain a license to continue to use the intellectual property rights that are the subject of the claim or otherwise restrict or prohibit our use of such intellectual property rights any required licensing fees may not be available to us on acceptable terms if at all for those intellectual property rights that are protected as trade secrets this litigation could result in even higher costs and potentially the loss of certain rights since we would not have a perfected intellectual property right that precludes others from making using or selling our products or processes the ongoing trend among our customers towards more transparent labeling could further diminish our ability to effectively protect our proprietary flavor formulations 

for intellectual property rights that we seek to protect through patents we cannot be certain that these rights if obtained will not later be opposed invalidated or circumvented in addition even if such rights are obtained in the united states the laws of some of the other countries in which our products are or may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states if other parties were to infringe on our intellectual property rights or if a third party successfully asserted that we had infringed on their intellectual property rights it could materially and adversely affect our future results of operations by i reducing the price that we could obtain in the marketplace for products which are based on such rights ii increasing the royalty or other fees that we may be required to pay in connection with such rights or iii limiting the volume if any of such products that we can sell 

our results of operations may be negatively impacted by the outcome of uncertainties related to litigation 

from time to time we are involved in a number of legal claims and litigation including claims related to intellectual property product liability environmental matters and indirect taxes we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of such litigation in addition we cannot provide assurance that future events will not result in an increase in the number of claims or require an increase in the amount accrued for any such claims or require accrual for one or more claims that has not been previously accrued in addition if we were found liable we could be subject to certain indemnification claims there can be no assurance that our insurance will be adequate to protect us from all material expenses related to pending and future claims or that such levels of insurance will be available in the future at economical prices 

the level of returns on pension and postretirement plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used for valuation purposes could affect our earnings and cash flows in future periods changes in government regulations could also affect our pension and postretirement plan expenses and funding requirements 

the funding obligations for our pension plans are impacted by the performance of the financial markets particularly the equity markets and interest rates funding obligations are determined under government regulations and are measured each year based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date if the financial markets do not provide the longterm returns that are expected under the governmental funding calculations we could be required to make larger contributions the equity markets can be very volatile and therefore our estimate of future contribution requirements can change dramatically in relatively short periods of time similarly changes in interest rates and legislation enacted by governmental authorities can impact the timing and amounts of contribution requirements an adverse change in the funded status of the plans could significantly increase our required contributions in the future and adversely impact our liquidity 

assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans are determined by us in consultation with outside consultants and advisors in the event that we determine that changes are warranted in the assumptions used such as the discount rate expected longterm rate of return on assets or expected health care costs our future pension and postretirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease due to changing market conditions or changes in the participant population the assumptions that we use may differ from actual results which could have a significant impact on our pension and postretirement liabilities and related costs and funding requirements 

any future impairment of our tangible or intangible longlived assets may adversely impact our profitability 

a significant portion of our assets consists of longlived assets including tangible assets such as our manufacturing facilities and intangible assets and goodwill as of december 31 2016 we had recorded 14 billion  of intangible assets and goodwill including goodwill and intangible assets related to our acquisitions longlived assets are subject to an impairment analysis 

  19 

whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable additionally goodwill is subject to an impairment test at least annually indicators such as underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results changes in the company’s strategy for its overall business or use of acquired assets unexpected negative industry or economic trends decreased market capitalization relative to net book values unanticipated competitive activities change in consumer demand loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts may signal that an asset has become impaired to the extent any of our acquisitions do not perform as anticipated whether due to internal or external factors the value of such assets may be negatively affected and we may be required to record impairment charges our results of operations and financial position in future periods could be negatively impacted should future impairments of our longlived assets including intangible assets or goodwill occur 

changes in our tax rates the adoption of new united states or international tax legislation or changes in existing tax laws could expose us to additional tax liabilities that may affect our future results 

we are subject to taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in liabilities for uncertain tax positions cost of repatriations or changes in tax laws or their interpretation any of these changes could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 

we have and will continue to implement transfer pricing policies among our various operations located in different countries these transfer pricing policies are a significant component of the management and compliance of our operations across international boundaries and overall financial results many countries routinely examine transfer pricing policies of taxpayers subject to their jurisdiction challenge transfer pricing policies aggressively where there is potential noncompliance and impose significant interest charges and penalties where noncompliance is determined there can be no assurance that a governmental authority will not challenge these policies more aggressively in the future or if challenged that we will prevail we could suffer significant costs related to one or more challenges to our transfer pricing policies 

we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and foreign tax authorities in those countries in which we operate and we may be subject to assessments or audits in the future in any of the countries in which we operate the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals and while we do not believe the results that follow would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition such results could have a material effect on our income tax provision net income or cash flows in the period or periods in which that determination is made 

in addition a number of international legislative and regulatory bodies have proposed legislation and begun investigations of the tax practices of multinational companies and in the european union “eu” the tax policies of certain eu member states one of these efforts has been led by the oecd an international association of 34 countries including the united states which has finalized recommendations to revise corporate tax transfer pricing and tax treaty provisions in member countries since 2013 the european commission “ec” has been investigating tax rulings granted by tax authorities in a number of eu member states with respect to specific multinational corporations to determine whether such rulings comply with eu rules on state aid as well as more recent investigations of the tax regimes of certain eu member states under eu law selective tax advantages for particular taxpayers that are not sufficiently grounded in economic realities may constitute impermissible state aid if the ec determines that a tax ruling or tax regime violates the state aid restrictions the tax authorities of the affected eu member state may be required to collect back taxes for the period of time covered by the ruling in late 2015 and early 2016 the ec declared that tax rulings related to other companies by tax authorities in luxembourg the netherlands and belgium did not comply with the eu state aid restrictions if the ec were to successfully challenge tax rulings applicable to us in any of the eu member states in which we are subject to taxation we could be exposed to increased tax liabilities 

our operations may be affected by greenhouse emissions and climate change and related regulations 

the availability of raw materials and energy supplies fluctuate in markets throughout the world climate change may also affect the availability and price of key raw materials including natural products used in the manufacture of our products in order to mitigate the risk of price increases and shortages our procurement team has developed various sourcing strategies including multiple suppliers inventory management systems various geographic suppliers and longterm agreements to mitigate risk 

in addition to market forces there are various regulatory efforts relating to climate change that may increase the cost of raw materials particularly energy used to operate our facilities that could materially impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  20 

the potential government regulation of certain of our product development initiatives is uncertain and we may be subject to adverse consequences if we fail to comply with applicable regulations 

as part of our ingredients research program we seek to collaborate with research institutions and companies throughout the world including biotechnology companies however it is unclear whether any of our product developments will be classified as genetically modified food products subject to regulation as a biotechnology product the manufacture of biotechnology products is subject to applicable current good manufacturing practice cgmp regulations as prescribed by the food and drug administration and the applicable standards prescribed by european commission and the competent authorities of european union member states and to other rules and regulations prescribed by foreign regulatory authorities compliance with these regulations can be expensive and time consuming such regulation could also subject us to requirements for labeling and traceability which may cause our customers to avoid our affected products and seek our competitors’ products this may result in our inability to realize any benefit from our investment and have an adverse effect on our operating results   

the united kingdom’s impending departure from the european union could have an adverse effect on us 

in june 2016 the united kingdom held a referendum in which a majority of voters voted to exit the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” as a result of the referendum it is expected that the british government will commence negotiations to determine the terms of the uk’s withdrawal from the european union a withdrawal could among other outcomes disrupt the free movement of goods services and people between the uk and the european union undermine bilateral cooperation in key geographic areas and significantly disrupt trade between the uk and the european union or other nations as the uk pursues independent trade relations in addition brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the uk determines which european union laws to replace or replicate the effects of brexit will depend on any agreements the uk makes to retain access to european union or other markets either during a transitional period or more permanently given the lack of comparable precedent it is unclear what financial trade and legal implications the withdrawal of the uk from the european union would have and how such withdrawal would affect us adverse consequences concerning brexit or the european union could include deterioration in global economic conditions instability in global financial markets political uncertainty volatility in currency exchange rates or adverse changes in the crossborder agreements currently in place any of which could have an adverse impact on our financial results in the future

legal proceedings 

tableend

we are subject to various claims and legal actions in the ordinary course of our business 

tax claims 

the spanish tax authorities alleged claims for a capital tax and the appellate court rejected one of the two bases upon which we based our capital tax position on january 22 2014 we filed an appeal and in order to avoid future interest costs in the event our appeal was unsuccessful we paid euro 98 million   112 million  representing the principal amount during the first quarter of 2014 on february 24 2016 we received a favorable ruling on our appeal from the spanish supreme court which overruled a lower court ruling as a result of this decision we reversed the previously recorded provision of euro 98 million   105 million  for the year ended december 31 2015 during 2016 we recorded additional income of 23 million  related to the finalization of amounts received from the authorities this amount has been principally reflected as a reduction of administrative expense 

we do not currently believe that any of our pending tax assessments even if ultimately resolved against us would have a material impact on our financial condition

over the past 20 years various federal and state authorities and private parties have claimed that we are a potentially responsible party “prp” as a generator of waste materials for alleged pollution at a number of waste sites operated by third parties located principally in new jersey and have sought to recover costs incurred and to be incurred to clean up the sites 

we have been identified as a prp at eight  facilities operated by third parties at which investigation andor remediation activities may be ongoing we analyze our potential liability on at least a quarterly basis we accrue for environmental liabilities when they are probable and estimable we estimate our share of the total future cost for these sites to be less than 5 million  

while joint and several liability is authorized under federal and state environmental laws we believe the amounts we have paid and anticipate paying in the future for cleanup costs and damages at all sites are not material and will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity this assessment is based upon among other 

  23 

things the involvement of other prps at most of the sites the status of the proceedings including various settlement agreements and consent decrees and the extended time period over which payments will likely be made there can be no assurance however that future events will not require us to materially increase the amounts we anticipate paying for cleanup costs and damages at these sites and that such increased amounts will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

in march 2012 zoomessence inc filed a complaint against the company in the us district court for the district of new jersey alleging trade secret misappropriation breach of contract and unjust enrichment in connection with certain spray dry technology disclosed to the company zoomessence sought an injunction and monetary damages zoomessence initially sought a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction but the court denied these applications in an order entered on september 27 2013 finding that zoomessence had not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of its claims on november 3 2014 zoomessence amended its complaint against the company to include allegations of breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing fraud in the inducement and misappropriation of confidential and proprietary information on november 13 2014 the company filed a counterclaim against zoomessence alleging trade secret misappropriation breach of contract breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing unjust enrichment misappropriation of confidential and proprietary information common law unfair competition tortious interference with contractual relations and conversion during the third quarter of 2016 the court stayed the case and directed the parties to mediate during the fourth quarter of 2016 the parties engaged in mediation and various settlement discussions which have not resulted in a resolution of the litigation to date if the case is not settled we expect that a trial on the merits of the case will occur during 2017 based on expert assessment of potential exposure and the status of the settlement discussions the company recorded an additional reserve of 50 million  during 2016 

the company determines estimates of reasonably possible losses or ranges of reasonably possible losses in excess of related accrued liabilities if any when it has determined that either a loss is reasonably possible or a loss in excess of accrued amounts is reasonably possible and the amount of losses or range of losses is determinable for all third party contingencies including labor contract technology tax productrelated claims and business litigation the company currently estimates that the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of any accrued liabilities is 0  to approximately 28 million  the estimates included in this amount are based on the company’s analysis of currently available information and as new information is obtained these estimates may change due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and the unpredictability of outcomes of legal proceedings any amounts accrued or included in this aggregate amount may not represent the ultimate loss to the company from the matters in question thus the company’s exposure and ultimate losses may be higher or lower and possibly significantly so than the amounts accrued or the range disclosed above 

we are also a party to other litigation arising in the ordinary course of our business we do not expect the outcome of these cases singly or in the aggregate to have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition

flavors are the key building blocks that impart taste experiences in food and beverage products and as such play a significant role in determining consumer preference of the end products in which they are used as a leading creator of flavors we help our customers deliver on the promise of delicious and healthy foods and drinks that appeal to consumers while we are a global leader our flavors business is more regional in nature with different formulas that reflect local taste preferences our flavors compounds are ultimately used by our customers in four enduse categories 1 savory 2 beverages 3 sweet and 4 dairy 

we are a global leader in the creation of fragrance compounds that are integral elements in  the world’s finest perfumes and bestknown consumer products within fabric care home care personal wash hair care and toiletries products our fragrances business consists of fragrance compounds and fragrance ingredients our fragrance compounds are defined into broad categories 1 fine fragrances and 2 consumer fragrances consumer fragrances consists of five enduse categories of products 1 fabric care 2 home care 3 personal wash 4 hair care and 5 toiletries in addition fragrance ingredients that are used internally and sold to third parties including customers and competitors for use in preparation of compounds and cosmetic active ingredients which consist of active and functional ingredients are included in the fragrances business unit 

the flavors and fragrances market is part of a larger market which supplies a wide variety of ingredients and compounds that are used in consumer products the broader market includes large multinational companies or smaller regional and local participants which supply products such as seasonings texturizers spices enzymes certain foodrelated commodities fortified products and cosmetic active ingredients the global market for flavors and fragrances has expanded consistently primarily as a result of an increase in demand for as well as an increase in the variety of consumer products containing flavors and fragrances in 2016  the flavors fragrances and cosmetic actives and functional ingredients market in which we compete was estimated by management to be approximately 200 billion  and is forecasted to grow approximately 23  by 2020  primarily 

  30 

driven by expected growth in emerging markets however the exact size of the global market is not available due to fragmentation of data we together with the other top three companies are estimated to represent approximately twothirds of the total estimated sales in the global flavors and fragrances subsegment of the broader market 

development of new flavors and fragrance compounds is driven by a variety of sources including requests from our customers who are in need of a specific flavor or fragrance for use in a new or modified consumer product or as a result of internal initiatives stemming from our consumer insights program our product development team works in partnership with our scientists and researchers to optimize the consumer appeal of the flavor or fragrance it then becomes a collaborative process between our researchers our product development team and our customers to perfect the flavor or fragrance so that it is ready to be included in the final consumer product 

 on january 17 2017 we completed the acquisition of fragrance resources for approximately euro 142 million  approximately 1505 million  the acquisition had no impact on our consolidated financial statements for 2016 the acquisition is expected to strengthen our fragrances market position in north america and germany 

2016  overview 

our 25 largest customers accounted for 52  of total sales in 2016  this percentage has remained fairly constant for several years sales to our largest customer across all enduse categories accounted for 12  of our sales for each of the last three fiscal years a key factor for commercial success is inclusion on our strategic customers’ core supplier lists which provides opportunities to win new business we are on the core supplier lists of a large majority of our global and strategic customers within fragrances and flavors 

sales in 2016  increased 3  on a reported basis and 5  on a currency neutral basis which excludes the effects of changes in currency with the effects of acquisitions contributing approximately 2  to both reported and currency neutral growth rates flavors achieved reported sales growth of 4  and currency neutral sales growth of 6  with the effect of acquisitions contributing approximately 3  to both reported and currency neutral growth rates fragrances achieved reported sales growth of 3  and currency neutral growth of 4  in 2016  with the effect of acquisitions contributing approximately 2  to both reported and currency neutral growth rates sales growth excluding acquisitions was driven by new win performance net of losses in both flavors and fragrance compounds additionally fragrance ingredients sales were up 9  on a reported basis and 10  on a currency neutral basis which were driven entirely by the inclusion of acquisitions overall our 2016  results continued to be driven by our strong emerging market presence that represented 51  of total sales and experienced 4  currency neutral growth in 2016  from a geographic perspective north america noam europe africa and middle east eame and greater asia ga all delivered sales growth on a consolidated basis in 2016  led by noam latin america la sales declined in 2016

2016  sales by business unit 



  



financial performance overview 

reported sales for 2016  increased 3  yearoveryear including approximately 2  growth from acquisitions we continue to benefit from our diverse portfolio of enduse product categories and geographies and had sales growth in three of our four regions and in consumer fragrances fragrance ingredients and flavor compounds both flavors and fragrances benefited from new win performance net of losses and the effect of acquisitions exchange rate variations represented a 2  decrease in yearoveryear sales the effect of exchange rates can vary by business and region depending upon the mix of sales by country as well as the relative percentage of local sales priced in us dollars versus local currencies currency neutral sales growth including acquisitions was 5  in 2016  we saw currency neutral sales growth during each quarter of 2016  we believe that market conditions and the macroeconomic environment will continue to be challenging in many markets in 2017  this lower growth environment combined with a stronger us dollar and the reset of the incentive compensation program is expected to pressure our currency neutral operating profit growth in 2017  

on a longterm basis we expect that sales growth for the industry will generally be in line with the underlying assumptions that support our longterm strategic goals albeit with some risk in the near term given the continuing global economic uncertainty we believe changing social habits resulting from increased disposable income improved focus on personal health and wellness awareness should help drive growth of our consumer product customers’ businesses

operating profit decreased 210 million  to 5674 million   182  of sales in 2016  compared to 5883 million   195  of sales in 2015  included in 2016  were net legal chargescredits of 485 million  acquisitionrelated costs of 122 million  gain on sale of fixed assets of 78 million  operational improvement initiative costs of 24 million  and restructuring and other charges net of 03 million  included in 2015 were acquisitionrelated costs of 183 million  the reversal of the previously recorded provision for the spanish capital tax case of 105 million  restructuring and other charges net of 76 million  accelerated contingent consideration payments of 72 million  and operational improvement initiative costs of 11 million  in 2015  excluding these charges adjusted operating profit was 6230 million   200  of sales for 2016  versus 6121 million   202  of sales for 2015  foreign currency changes had an unfavorable impact on operating profit of approximately 2  and 6  in 2016  and 2015  respectively 

cash flows from operations were 5354 million  or 172  of sales in 2016  as compared to cash flows from operations of 4336 million  or 143  of sales during 2015  the increase in operating cash flows in 2016  as compared to 2015  is principally related to the impact of decreased core working capital requirements trade receivables inventories and accounts payable and lower pension contributions 

our capital spend was 1264 million   41  of sales excluding david michael during 2016  given our intent to construct a new flavors facility in china the continuation of our indonesia project spending associated with the integrations of david michael and fragrance resources infrastructure needs in india upgrades to creative center and application laboratory facilities and carryover payments from 2016 we expect that capital spending in 2017  will be about 5  of sales net of potential grants and other reimbursements from government authorities

fragrances segment profit decreased 137 million to 3218 million in 2015 204 of sales compared to 3354 million 206 of sales reported in 2014 the decrease in segment profit and profit margin was principally driven by unfavorable foreign currency impacts which were partially offset by favorable volume growth sales mix and a slight impact from the addition of lucas meyer 

global expenses 

global expenses represent corporate and headquarterrelated expenses which include legal finance human resources and rd and other administrative expenses that are not allocated to an individual business unit in 2015 global expenses were 282 million compared to 654 million during 2014 the decrease is principally driven by lower incentive compensation expense and the favorable impact of our cash flow hedging program 

interest expense 

in 2015 interest expense remained comparable with the prior year at 461 million average cost of debt was 45 for the 2015 period compared to 49 in 2014 

other expense income net 

other expense income net decreased approximately 60 million to 32 million of expense in 2015 versus 28 million of income in 2014 this decrease is primarily driven by lower foreign exchange gains on working capital and lower marktomarket adjustments on deferred compensation plan assets during 2015 compared to the 2014 period 

income taxes 

the effective tax rate was 222 in 2015 as compared to 245 in 2014 excluding the 26 million tax benefit associated with the pretax restructuring charges and operational improvement initiatives the 62 million benefit associated with acquisition related costs the 105 million tax settlement received in 2015 due to favorable tax rulings in spain and 

  41 

another jurisdiction as well as the 29 million charge related to the reversal of the previously recorded provision for the spanish capital tax case the adjusted tax rate for 2015 was 242 excluding the 26 million tax benefit associated with the pretax restructuring charges and operational improvement initiative costs as well as the 38 million tax benefit related to the reserve reversal for the 2001 spanish dividend withholding tax case the adjusted tax rate for 2014 was 253 the yearoveryear reduction reflected a benefit from lower cost of repatriation and loss provisions which were partially offset by mix of earnings 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash and cash equivalents 

we had cash and cash equivalents of 3240 million  at december 31 2016  compared to 1820 million  at december 31 2015  of which 2526 million of the balance at december 31 2016  was held outside the united states cash balances held in foreign jurisdictions are in most circumstances available to be repatriated to the united states however they would be subject to united states federal income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits we have not provided us income tax expense on substantially all of the accumulated undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries because we have the ability and plan to reinvest these indefinitely 

effective utilization of the cash generated by our international operations is a critical component of our tax strategy strategic dividend repatriation from foreign subsidiaries creates us taxable income which enables us to realize us deferred tax assets we regularly repatriate in the form of dividends from our nonus subsidiaries a portion of our current year earnings to fund financial obligations in the us these repatriations of current year earnings totaled 1345 million 1846 million and 2480 million in 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively 

cash flows from operating activities 

operating cash flows in 2016  were 5354 million  compared to 4336 million  in 2015  and 5184 million  in 2014  the increase in operating cash flows in 2016 as compared to 2015 is principally related to the impact of decreased core working capital requirements trade receivables inventories and accounts payable and lower pension contributions included in 2014 was payment of 112 million to the spanish government related to a capital tax case 

working capital current assets less current liabilities totaled 7107 million  at yearend 2016  compared to 7120 million  at december 31 2015  this slight decrease in working capital of 13 million  primarily reflects an increase in payable balances principally associated with shortterm debt which were partially offset by increased cash balances as a result of our borrowings under the euro senior notes  2016 we sold certain accounts receivable on a nonrecourse basis to unrelated financial institutions under “factoring” agreements that are sponsored solely and individually by certain customers we believe that participating in the factoring programs strengthens our relationships with these customers and provides operational efficiencies we estimate that as a result of participating in the programs there was a beneficial impact on cash provided by operations of approximately 340 million  34 million  and 331 million  in 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively the cost of participating in these programs was immaterial to our results in all periods 

cash flows used in investing activities 

net investing activities in 2016  utilized 3555 million  compared to 5772 million  and 2213 million  in 2015  and 2014  respectively the decrease in cash paid for investing activities is primarily driven by the acquisition of david michael in 2016 for approximately 2369 million  net of cash acquired as compared to the acquisitions of ottens flavors and lucas meyer for approximately 1885 million  net of cash acquired and 3051 million  net of cash acquired respectively in 2015 the 2014 amount was principally driven by the acquisition of aromor for approximately 1025 million  net of cash acquired 

additions to property plant and equipment were 1264 million  1010 million  and 1432 million  in 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively net of grants and other reimbursements from government authorities these investments largely arise from our ongoing focus to align our manufacturing facilities with our customer demand primarily in emerging markets and new technology consistent with our strategy 

in light of our intent to construct a new flavors facility in china our relocation of our ingredients facility in hangzhou china and the continuation of our indonesia project we expect that capital spending in 2017  will be about 5  of sales net of potential grants and other reimbursements from government authorities 

cash flows used in financing activities 

net financing activities in 2016  utilized 197 million  compared to 1313 million  and 2023 million  in 2015  and 2014  respectively the decrease in outflow of cash used in financing activities in 2016  as compared to 2015  principally reflects borrowings under the euro senior notes  2016 which were offset by repayment of our senior notes  2006 as well as higher 

  42 

dividend payments and treasury share repurchases in 2016 the decrease in outflow of cash used in financing activities in 2015 compared to 2014 principally reflected incremental dividend payments and treasury share repurchases in 2015 which were more than offset by proceeds from the drawdown on the revolving credit facility during 2015 

at december 31 2016  we had 13254 million  of debt outstanding compared to 10677 million  outstanding at december 31 2015  

we paid dividends totaling 1849 million  1589 million  and 1332 million  in 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively the cash dividend declared per share in 2016  2015  and 2014  was 240  206 and 172 respectively 

in december 2012 the board of directors authorized a 250 million share repurchase program which commenced in the first quarter of 2013 in august 2015 the board of directors approved an additional 250 million share repurchase authorization and extension through december 31 2017 based on the total remaining amount of 109 million  available under the repurchase program approximately 09 million  shares or 12  of shares outstanding based on the market price and shares outstanding as of december 31 2016  could be repurchased under the program as of december 31 2016  the purchases will be made from time to time on the open market or through private transactions as market and business conditions warrant repurchased shares will be placed into treasury stock the ultimate level of purchases will be a function of the daily purchase limits established in the preapproved program according to the share price at that time 

capital resources 

operating cash flow provides the primary source of funds for capital investment needs dividends paid to shareholders and debt service repayments we anticipate that cash flows from operations and availability under our existing credit facilities are sufficient to meet our investing and financing needs for at least the next eighteen months we regularly assess our capital structure including both current and longterm debt instruments as compared to our cash generation and investment needs in order to provide ample flexibility and to optimize our leverage ratios based on our leverage ratios and general market interest rate expectations we anticipate evaluating refinancing opportunities during 2017  we believe our existing cash balances are sufficient to meet our debt service requirements 

during the first quarter of 2017 we acquired fragrance resources for approximately 1433 million net of cash acquired which was funded from existing resources 

during the fourth quarter of 2016 we acquired david michael for approximately 2369 million  net of cash acquired which was funded from existing resources 

during the third quarter of 2015 we acquired lucas meyer for approximately 3051 million  net of cash acquired which was funded from existing resources 

during the second quarter of 2015 we acquired ottens flavors for approximately 1885 million  net of cash acquired which was funded from existing resources 

credit facility and senior notes 

we supplement shortterm liquidity with access to capital markets mainly through bank credit facilities and issuance of commercial paper 

commercial paper 

during 2016  we issued approximately 65 million  of commercial paper which was fully repaid by december 31 2016 as of december 31 2016  there was no commercial paper outstanding we did not issue commercial paper during 2015  

subsequent to december 31 2016 we issued approximately 875 million  of commercial paper 

credit facility 

there are two tranches under the credit facility tranche a of the facility is now available to borrowers in us dollars euros swiss francs japanese yen and british sterling in an aggregate amount up to an equivalent of approximately 5641 million  with a sublimit of 25 million  for swing line borrowings tranche b of the facility is now available to borrowers in us dollars euros swiss francs japanese yen and british sterling in an aggregate amount up to an equivalent of approximately 3859 million  with sublimits of €50 million  and 25 million  for swing line borrowings 

the credit facility is available for general corporate purposes borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at an annual rate of libor plus a margin currently 1125 bps linked to our credit rating the interest rate under our credit facility at 

  43 

december 31 2016  was 113  the credit facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants including the requirement for us to maintain at the end of each fiscal quarter a ratio of net debt for borrowed money to adjusted ebitda in respect of the previous 12month period of not more than 350 to 1 based on this ratio at december 31 2016  our covenant compliance would provide overall borrowing capacity of 16473 million  

during the first quarter of 2016 the company repaid the full amount outstanding under the credit facility  1312 million  

as of december 31 2016  we had no borrowings under the credit facility the amount which we are able to draw down on under the credit facility is limited by financial covenants as described in more detail below our drawdown capacity on the credit facility was 950 million  at december 31 2016  see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the credit facility 

at december 31 2016  and 2015  we were in compliance with all financial and other covenants including the net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio at december 31 2016  our net debtadjusted ebitda 1 ratio was 132  to 1 as defined by the credit facility well below the financial covenants of existing outstanding debt failure to comply with the financial and other covenants under our debt agreements would constitute default and would allow the lenders to accelerate the maturity of all indebtedness under the related agreement if such acceleration were to occur we would not have sufficient liquidity available to repay the indebtedness we would likely have to seek amendments under the agreements for relief from the financial covenants or repay the debt with proceeds from the issuance of new debt or equity andor asset sales if necessary we may be unable to amend the agreements or raise sufficient capital to repay such obligations in the event the maturities are accelerated

other commitments 

compliance with existing governmental requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment has not materially affected our operations earnings or competitive position in 2016  and 2015  we spent 46 million and 93 million on capital projects and 160 million and 190 million respectively in operating expenses and governmental charges for the purpose of complying with such regulations expenditures for these purposes will continue for the foreseeable future in addition we are party to a number of proceedings brought under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act or similar state statutes it is expected that the impact of any judgments in or voluntary settlements of such proceedings will not be material to our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

contractual obligations 

at december 31 2016  we had contractual payment obligations due within the time periods as specified in the following table   



 

 the table above does not include 264 million  of the total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions and approximately 11 million  of associated accrued interest due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential cash flows we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the amount and period in which the remaining liabilities might be paid 

  45 

critical accounting policies and use of estimates 

our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements as disclosed in note 1 the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and accompanying disclosures these estimates are based on management’s best judgment of current events and actions that we may undertake in the future actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates 

those areas requiring the greatest degree of management judgment or deemed most critical to our financial reporting involve 

the periodic assessment of potential impairment of goodwill  we currently have goodwill of 10 billion  in assessing the potential for impairment of goodwill management uses the most current actual and forecasted operating data available and current market based assumptions in accordance with the criteria in asc 350 the company has identified four reporting units 1 flavors 2 fragrance compounds 3 fragrance ingredients and 4 cosmetic active ingredients 

the company performed the annual goodwill impairment test utilizing the twostep approach for the flavors fragrance compounds fragrance ingredients and cosmetic active ingredients reporting units by assessing the fair value of our reporting units based on discounted cash flows we completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of november 30 2016  which indicated no impairment of goodwill as the estimated fair values substantially exceeded the carrying values of each of these reporting units 

the periodic assessment of potential impairment of finitelived intangible assets  we currently have intangible assets of 3658 million  the company reviews longlived assets for impairment when events or changes in business conditions indicate that their full carrying value may not be recovered an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by an asset or group of assets is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists if assets are determined to be impaired the loss is measured based on an estimate of fair value using various valuation techniques including a discounted estimate of future cash flows 

the analysis and evaluation of income taxes  we account for taxes under the asset and liability method under this method deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax return bases of assets and liabilities a valuation allowance is recognized if based on the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized the assessment of the need for a valuation allowance requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future earnings reversal of existing temporary differences and available tax planning strategies if actual experience differs from these estimates and assumptions the recorded deferred tax asset may not be fully realized resulting in an increase to income tax expense in our results of operations 

the company has not established deferred tax liabilities for substantially all undistributed foreign earnings as it has plans to and intends to indefinitely reinvest those earnings to finance foreign activities the unrecognized deferred tax liability on these undistributed earnings approximates 344 million  

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes we first determine whether it is “more likely than not” that we would sustain our tax position if the relevant tax authority were to audit the position with full knowledge of all the relevant facts and other information for those tax positions that meet this threshold we measure the amount of tax benefit based on the largest amount of tax benefit that we have a greater than 50 chance of realizing in a final settlement with the relevant authority those tax positions failing to qualify for initial recognition are recognized in the first interim period in which they meet the more likely than not standard this evaluation is made at the time that we adopt a tax position and whenever there is new information and is based upon management’s evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date we maintain a cumulative risk portfolio relating to all of our uncertainties in income taxes in order to perform this analysis but the evaluation of our tax positions requires significant judgment and estimation in part because in certain cases tax law is subject to varied interpretation and whether a tax position will ultimately be sustained may be uncertain we do not currently believe that any of our pending tax assessments even if ultimately resolved against us would have a material impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

the evaluation of potential litigation and environmental liabilities where changing circumstances rules and regulations require regular reassessment of related practices and anticipated costs  we are subject to certain legal claims regarding products and other matters as well as environmentalrelated matters significant management judgment is involved in determining when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the extent to which it can be reasonably estimated 

we regularly assess potential liabilities with respect to all legal claims based on the most recent available information in consultation with outside counsel we have engaged on our behalf to handle the defense of such matters to the extent a liability is considered to be probable and reasonably estimable we recognize a corresponding liability if the reasonably estimated liability is a range we recognize that amount considered most likely or in the absence of such a determination the minimum 

  46 

reasonably estimated liability to the extent such claims are covered by various insurance policies we separately evaluate the right to recovery and estimate the related insurance claim receivable management judgments involve determination as to whether a liability has been incurred the reasonably estimated amount of that liability and any potential insurance recovery 

we regularly evaluate potential environmental exposure in terms of total estimated cost and the viability of other potentially responsible parties “prp’s” associated with our exposure recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress and additional information becomes available critical management assumptions relate to expected total costs to remediate and the financial viability of prp’s to share such costs 

determination of the various assumptions employed in the valuation of pension and retiree health care expense and associated obligations  amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined from actuarial valuations inherent in such valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets discount rates at which the liabilities could be settled rates of increase in future compensation levels mortality rates and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore affect expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods 

we consider a number of factors in determining and selecting assumptions for the overall expected longterm rate of return on plan assets we consider the historical longterm return experience of our assets the current and expected allocation of our plan assets and expected longterm rates of return we derive these expected longterm rates of return with the assistance of our investment advisors we base our expected allocation of plan assets on a diversified portfolio consisting of domestic and international equity securities fixed income real estate and alternative asset classes 

we consider a variety of factors in determining and selecting our assumptions for the discount rate at december 31 for the us plans the discount rate was based on the internal rate of return for a portfolio of high quality bonds rated aa or higher by either moody’s or standard  poors with maturities that are consistent with the projected future benefit payment obligations of the plan for the nonus plans the discount rates were determined by region and are based on high quality longterm corporate bonds consideration has been given to the duration of the liabilities in each plan when selecting the bonds to be used in determining the discount rate the rate of compensation increase for all plans and the medical cost trend rate for the applicable us plans are based on plan experience 

with respect to the us plans the expected rate of return on plan assets was determined based on an asset allocation model using the current target allocation real rates of return by asset class and an anticipated inflation rate the target asset allocation consists of approximately 40  in equity securities and 60  in fixed income securities the plan has achieved a compounded annual rate of return of 63 over the previous 20 years at december 31 2016  the actual asset allocation for the us plan was 36  in equity securities and 64  in fixed income securities 

the expected rate of return for the nonus plans employs a similar set of criteria adapted for local investments inflation rates and in certain cases specific government requirements the target asset allocation for the nonus plans consists of approximately 40  – 70  in fixed income securities 15  – 40  in equity securities 5  – 20  in real estate and 5  – 10  in alternative investments at december 31 2016  the actual asset allocation for the nonus plan was 56  in fixed income investments 27  in equity investments 5  in real estate investments 2  in cash and cash equivalents and 10  in alternative investments 

changes in pension and other postemployment benefits and associated expenses may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions the impact that a 025 decrease in the discount rate or a 1 change in the medical cost trend rate would have on our pension and other postemployment benefit expense as applicable is as follows 



the effect of a 1 increase in the medical cost trend rate would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and the annual postretirement expense by approximately 03 million  and less than 01 million  respectively a 1 decrease in the rate would decrease the obligation and expense by approximately 04 million  and less than 01 million  respectively 

  47 

the ongoing assessment of the valuation of inventory given the large number of natural ingredients employed the quality of which may be diminished over time  we hold a majority of our inventory as raw materials providing the greatest degree of flexibility in manufacture and use as of december 31 2016  we maintained 49  of our inventory as raw materials materials are evaluated based on shelf life known uses and anticipated demand based on forecasted customer order activity and changes in productsales mix management policy provides for an ongoing assessment of inventory with adjustments recorded when an item is deemed to be slow moving or obsolete 

we believe that we have considered relevant circumstances that we may be currently subject to and the financial statements accurately reflect our best estimate of the impact of these items in our results of operations financial condition and cash flows for the years presented we have discussed the decision process and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 

new accounting standards

nongaap financial measures 

the company uses nongaap financial operating measures in this quarterly report including i currency neutral sales which eliminates the effects that result from translating its international sales in us dollars ii adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross margin which exclude acquisitionrelated costs operational improvement initiative costs and restructuring charges iii adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating margin which excludes legal chargescredits acquisitionrelated costs operational improvement initiative costs restructuring charges and gains on sale of assets iv adjusted selling and administrative expenses which excludes legal chargescredits acquisitionrelated costs operational improvement initiative costs and restructuring charges and v adjusted effective tax rate which excludes legal chargescredits acquisitionrelated costs operational improvement initiative costs restructuring charges and gains on the sale of assets the company also provides the nongaap measures adjusted ebitda which excludes certain specified items and noncash items as set forth in the company’s debt agreements and net debt which is adjusted for deferred gain on interest rate swaps and cash and cash equivalents solely for the purpose of providing information on the extent to which the company is in compliance with debt covenants contained in its debt agreements 

we have included each of these nongaap measures in order to provide additional information regarding our underlying operating results and comparable yearoveryear performance such information is supplemental to information presented in accordance with gaap and is not intended to represent a presentation in accordance with gaap in discussing our historical and expected future results and financial condition we believe it is meaningful for investors to be made aware of and to be assisted in a better understanding of on a periodtoperiod comparable basis financial amounts both including and excluding these identified items as well as the impact of exchange rate fluctuations we believe such additional nongaap information provides investors with an overall perspective of the periodtoperiod performance of our business in addition management internally reviews each of these nongaap measures to evaluate performance on a comparative periodtoperiod basis in terms 

  49 

of absolute performance trends and expected future performance with respect to our business a material limitation of these nongaap measures is that such measures do not reflect actual gaap amounts we compensate for such limitations by using these measures as one of several metrics including gaap measures these nongaap measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 

a reconciliation of nongaap metrics

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we operate on a global basis and are exposed to currency fluctuation related to the manufacture and sale of our products in currencies other than the us dollar the major foreign currencies involve the markets in the european union great britain mexico brazil china india indonesia australia and japan although all regions are subject to foreign currency fluctuations versus the us dollar we actively monitor our foreign currency exposures in all major markets in which we operate and 

  53 

employ a variety of techniques to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations including foreign currency hedging activities 

we have established a centralized reporting system to evaluate the effects of changes in interest rates currency exchange rates and other relevant market risks our risk management procedures include the monitoring of interest rate and foreign exchange exposures and hedge positions utilizing statistical analyses of cash flows market value and sensitivity analysis however the use of these techniques to quantify the market risk of such instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of their accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions for the year ended december 31 2016  the company’s exposure to market risk was estimated using sensitivity analyses which illustrate the change in the fair value of a derivative financial instrument assuming hypothetical changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts with the objective of reducing exposure to cash flow volatility associated with foreign currency receivables and payables and with anticipated purchases of certain raw materials used in operations these contracts the counterparties to which are major international financial institutions generally involve the exchange of one currency for a second currency at a future date and have maturities not exceeding twelve months the gain or loss on the hedging instrument and services is recorded in earnings at the same time as the transaction being hedged is recorded in earnings at december 31 2016  the company’s foreign currency exposures pertaining to derivative contracts exist with the euro japanese yen british pound australian dollar and indonesian rupiah based on a hypothetical decrease or increase of 10 in the applicable balance sheet exchange rates primarily against the us dollar the estimated fair value of the company’s foreign currency forward contracts would increase or decrease by approximately 36 million however any change in the value of the contracts real or hypothetical would be significantly offset by a corresponding change in the value of the underlying hedged items 

we have also used nonus dollar borrowings and foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the foreign currency exposures of our net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries primarily in the european union based on a hypothetical decrease or increase of 10 in the value of the us dollar against the euro the estimated fair value of the company’s foreign currency forward contracts would change by approximately 7 million however any change in the value of the contracts real or hypothetical would be significantly offset by a corresponding change in the value of the underlying hedged items 

we use derivative instruments as part of our interest rate risk management strategy the derivative instruments used are comprised of fixed to variable rate interest rate swaps based on the libor plus an interest mark up and interest rate swaps to hedge the anticipated issuance of fixed rate debt the notional amount interest payment and maturity date of the swaps match the principal interest payment and maturity date of the related debt and the swaps are valued using observable benchmark rates based on a hypothetical decrease or increase of one percentage point in libor the estimated fair value of the company’s interest rate swaps would change by less than 10 million 

at december 31 2016  the fair value of our fixed rate debt was 14 billion based on a hypothetical decrease of 10 in interest rates the estimated fair value of the company’s fixed debt would increase by 6 million 

we purchase certain commodities such as natural gas electricity petroleum based products and certain crop related items we generally purchase these commodities based upon market prices that are established with the vendor as part of the purchase process in general we do not use commodity financial instruments to hedge commodity prices

we principally compete in the flavors and fragrances market which is part of a larger market which supplies a wide variety of ingredients and compounds that are used in consumer products the broader market includes large multinational companies and smaller regional and local participants that supply products such as seasonings texturizers spices enzymes certain foodrelated commodities fortified products and cosmetic ingredients the global market for flavors and fragrances has expanded consistently primarily as a result of an increase in demand for as well as an increase in the variety of consumer products containing flavors and fragrances t he flavors and fragrances markets in which we compete were estimated by management to be 180 billion in 2014 and are forecasted to grow to approximately 216 billion by 2019 primarily driven by expected growth in emerging markets 

source company estimates based on ial consultants overview of the global flavours  fragrances market 9th edition 2014 

in 2015 we achieved sales of approximately 30 billion  making us one of the top four companies in the global flavors and fragrances subsegment of the broader ingredients and compounds market within the flavors and fragrances subsegment of this broader market the top four companies represent approximately twothirds of the total estimated sales in late 2015 we expanded our capabilities and product offerings into cosmetic actives through our acquisition of lucas meyer we estimate the market size for cosmetic active ingredients to be approximately 15 billion as of 2015 we believe that our diversified business platform consisting of expansive geographic coverage a broad product portfolio and a global and regional customer base positions us to achieve longterm growth as the flavors and fragrances markets expand 

  3 

we operate in two business segments flavors and fragrances in 2015 our flavors business represented 48 of our sales while our fragrances business represented 52 of sales our business is geographically diverse with sales to customers in the four regions set forth below   



we are committed to winning in emerging markets we believe that significant future growth potential for the flavors and fragrances industry and for our business exists in the emerging markets all markets except north america japan australia and western southern and northern europe over the past five years our currency neutral growth rate in emerging markets have outpaced that of developed markets despite current challenges experienced during 2015 in certain emerging markets such as brazil argentina and china we expect this longterm trend to continue for the foreseeable future

for financial information about our operating segments and the geographic areas in which we do business please see note 13 of our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

vision 2020 strategy 

during 2015 we announced our vision 2020 strategy which focuses on building differentiation and accelerating growth our vision 2020 strategy has four pillars 

   

 

 

   4 

adjacent products or services that will position us to leverage our expertise in science and technology and our customer base as part of this pillar we are targeting 500 million to 1 billion of incremental sales growth through acquisitions by 2020 

during 2015 we completed two acquisitions that are aligned with our vision 2020 strategy through our acquisition of ottens flavors in may 2015 we strengthened our flavors market position in north america and increased our capabilities to serve small and midsized customers we believe our acquisition of lucas meyer will expand our ingredients offerings into the cosmetic industry and thereby allow us to build greater customer intimacy and drive penetration into the skin care and hair care businesses 

our product offerings 

flavors 

flavors are the key building blocks that impart taste experiences in food and beverage products and as such play a significant role in determining consumer preference of the end products in which they are used as a leading creator of flavor compounds we help our customers deliver on the promise of delicious and healthy foods and drinks that appeal to consumers while we are a global leader our flavors business is more regional in nature with different formulas that reflect local taste preferences we create our flavors in our regional creative centers that allow us to satisfy local taste preferences while also helping to ensure regulatory compliance and production standards we develop thousands of different flavors and taste offerings for our customers most of which are tailormade we continually develop new formulas in order to meet changing consumer preferences and customer needs 

our flavors compounds are ultimately used by our customers in the following four enduse categories of consumer goods 1 savory  for use in soups sauces condiments prepared meals meat and poultry potato chips and other savory snacks 2 beverages  for use in juice drinks carbonated beverages flavored waters and spirits 3 sweet   for use in bakery products candy chewing gum and cereal and 4 dairy for use in all dairy products such as yogurt ice cream and cheese and other products that have a creamy flavor we also offer a wide range of quality vanilla extracts and a variety of flavor solutions that build on our understanding of vanilla 

our vision 2020 strategy in flavors builds upon our strengths and focuses on addressing industry trends that will allow us to differentiate ourselves from our competitors and deliver accelerated growth these trends include 

1 consumer demand for fresh authentic and natural products  as evidenced by recent trends in product labeling consumers increasingly seek to understand what they are consuming our objective is to expand our naturals capabilities by offering our customers naturals and proprietary ingredients 

2 consumer demand for products that promote health and wellness  consumers especially those in developed markets such as the united states and western europe are increasingly seeking to focus on products which promote health and wellness and taste good often this demand is translated into a desire to provide consumer products with reduced fat and salt our objective is to capture a significant share of this shift in consumer demand by continuing to expand our modulation technology delivery systems and our naturals and proprietary ingredients 

3 expansion of consumer food companies  the number of participants in the food industry continues to expand drastically with midsized regional companies and companies focused on nicheproduct categories joining the traditional global companies to drive and accelerate product innovation we intend to look for innovative and valuecreating methods  for serving this growing customer base as evidenced by our recent acquisition of ottens flavors which we believe will permit us to further penetrate small and midsized customers by delivering tailored solutions with the necessary agility speed and responsiveness 

4 new sources of protein  sustainability concerns are driving the food industry to evaluate nontraditional sources of protein as part of our rd initiatives we seek to develop a comprehensive understanding of flavor interaction with protein and texture and develop taste solutions for new or alternative protein sources 

fragrances 

we are a global leader in the creation of fragrance compounds that are integral elements in the world’s finest perfumes and bestknown consumer products within fabric care home care personal wash hair care and toiletries our fragrance business is a vertically integrated operation originating with the development in our research laboratories of naturals synthetic and proprietary molecules and innovative delivery systems progressing to our manufacturing facilities that produce these ingredients in a consistent highquality and costeffective manner and transitioning to our creative centers where our 

  5 

perfumers partner with our customers to create unique fragrance compounds for use in a variety of enduse products 

by providing our fragrance development teams an extensive portfolio of innovative highquality and costeffective ingredients to support their creativity we are able to provide our customers with a unique identity for their brands these ingredients or fragrance compounds can then be combined with our innovative delivery systems including i our proprietary encapsulation technology which consists of individual fragrance droplets coated with a protective polymetric shell to deliver superior fragrance performance throughout a product’s lifecycle and ii our exclusive polymer delivery system polyiff which is a “solid fragrance” technology that allows us to add scent to functional or molded plastic these delivery systems are key differentiators that fuel the growth of our consumer fragrance compounds 

our fragrances business derives revenues from two sources fragrance compounds and ingredients 

fragrance compounds   fragrance compounds are unique and proprietary combinations of multiple ingredients that are ultimately used by our customers in their consumer goods our creative and commercial teams within fragrance compounds are organized into two broad categories fine fragrances and consumer fragrances 

 

ingredients   while the principal role of our fragrance ingredients facilities is to support our fragrance compounds business we utilize our excess manufacturing capacity to manufacture and sell certain fragrance ingredients to third parties we believe that this business allows us to leverage our fixed costs while maintaining the security of supply for our perfumers and ultimately our customers ingredients available for sale to third parties include innovative ingredients that leverage our manufacturing experience as well as a limited amount of costcompetitive commodity ingredients as our fragrance compounds business grows we expect that the percentage of capacity allocated to the production of fragrance ingredients for sale to third parties will decrease 

with approximately 1000 separate fragrance active and functional cosmetic active ingredients plus additional botanicals and delivery systems acquired in the recent lucas meyer transaction we believe we are a leader in the industry with the breadth of our product portfolio 

our vision 2020 strategy in fragrances builds upon our strengths to differentiate ourselves from our competitors and deliver accelerated growth specifically we intend to focus on 

1 consumer demand for natural and organic products  increased demand for natural ingredients is a primary driver of future growth in fine fragrances we believe that our inhouse naturals operations led by laboratoire monique rémy “lmr” in grasse france are industry leading in the processing of quality materials and offer decades of experience understanding natural products and perfecting the process of transforming naturals such as narcissus jasmine and blackcurrant bud into pure absolutes that retain the unique fragrance of their origin our objective is to expand our naturals capabilities by offering our clients naturals and proprietary ingredients 

2 transparency in labeling  as consumers worldwide seek to require transparency in labeling our customers will progressively seek to differentiate their products through proprietary molecules and unique delivery systems a major emphasis of our research program is the creation of new proprietary molecules and ingredients 

3 sustainability  consumers aspire to purchase products that are earthfriendly and sustainable as part of vision 2020 we have committed to strengthen our sustainable practices and become the leader within our industry 

4 delivery systems we continue to invest in our delivery system technologies including expansion of our marketleading encapsulation technology which we believe will allow us to differentiate our products and those of our customers our encapsulation technology extends controls the release of and increases aromas in a variety of consumer products with our acquisition of lucas meyer we expanded our portfolio to offer multifunctional delivery systems with cosmetic actives that work to enhance skin penetration protect the active against interactions with other ingredients provide longlasting 

  6 

release facilitate formulation of challenging ingredients and allow a bettertargeted action 

our fragrances business collaborates with some of the world’s leading art and fashion schools to tap into the creative minds of the future leaders of fashion and design we collaborate with scientists writers artists musicians and film makers to expose our perfumers to new and constantly evolving creative territories and approaches 

research and product development process 

consumer insights 

we believe that the first step to creating a unique scent or taste experience begins with gaining insight into the consumer by developing a deep understanding of what consumers value and prefer we are better able to focus our rd and creative efforts our quest to bring new exciting and winning ideas to our clients begins with insight into the consumer 

our consumer insight and marketing teams work tirelessly interpreting trends monitoring product launches analyzing quantitative market data and conducting several hundred thousand consumer interviews annually our sensory experts direct research programs exploring topics such as fragrance performance the psychophysics of sensory perception including chemesthetic properties such as warming cooling and tingling the genetic basis for flavor and fragrance preference and the effects of aromas on mood performance health and wellbeing 

based on this information we develop innovative programs to evaluate potential products that enable us to understand the emotional connections between a prospective product and the consumer we believe this ability to pinpoint the likelihood of a product’s success translates into stronger brand equity resulting in increased returns and greater market share gains for our customers as well as iff 

research and development 

we consider our rd development infrastructure to be one of our key competencies and we focus and invest substantial resources in the research and development of new and innovative compounds formulas and technologies and the application of these to our customers’ products we spend approximately 8 of our sales on the research development and implementation of new molecules compounds and technologies that help our customers respond to changing consumer preferences using the knowledge gained from our consumer insights program we strategically focus our resources around key rd platforms that address consumer needs or preferences or anticipate future preferences by aligning our resources around these platforms we ensure the proper support and focus for each program so that it can be further developed and eventually accepted for commercial application as a result of this investment we have been granted 305 patents in the united states since 2000 including 15 in 2015  and we have developed many unique molecules and delivery systems for our customers that are used as the foundations of successful flavors and fragrances around the world 

we principally conduct our rd activities in union beach new jersey where we employ scientists and application engineers who collaborate with our five other rd centers around the world to support the 

 as of december 31 2015  we employed about 1400 people globally in rd activities we spent 2461 million  2536 million  and 2598 million  or approximately 8  8  and 9  of sales in 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively on rd activities 

our ingredients research program discovers molecules found in natural substances and creates new molecules that are subsequently tested for their sensorial value to broaden our offerings of natural innovative and unique products we seek collaborations with research institutions and other companies throughout the world we have established a number of such collaborations for example our ongoing relationship with amyris to strengthen the pipeline of new and innovative molecules that we expect to launch in the coming years to further strengthen and broaden technology offerings and capabilities we acquired lucas meyer in 2015 to expand our product portfolio of ingredients for the cosmetic and personal care industries 

the development of new and customized flavor and fragrance compounds is a complex process calling upon the combined knowledge of our scientists flavorists and perfumers scientists from various disciplines work in project teams with flavorists and perfumers to develop flavor and fragrance compounds with consumer preferred performance characteristics the development of new flavor and fragrance compounds requires i an indepth knowledge of the flavor and fragrance 

  7 

characteristics of the various ingredients we use ii an understanding of how the many ingredients in a consumer product interact and iii the creation of controlled release and delivery systems to enhance flavor and fragrance performance to facilitate this process we have a scientific advisory board comprised of five leading scientists that provide external perspectives and independent feedback on our rd initiatives 

creative application 

we also have a network of 33 creative centers around the world where we create or adapt the basic flavors or fragrances that we have developed in the rd process to commercialize for use in our customers’ consumer products our global creative teams consist of perfumers fragrance evaluators and flavorists as well as marketing consumer insights and technical application experts from a wide range of cultures and nationalities in close partnership with our customers’ product development groups our creative teams create the scents and tastes that our customers are seeking in order to satisfy consumer demands in each of their markets 

development of new flavors and fragrances is driven by a variety of sources including requests from our customers who are in need of a specific flavor or fragrance for use in a new or modified consumer product or as a result of internal initiatives stemming from our consumer insights program our product development team works in partnership with our scientists and researchers to optimize the consumer appeal of the flavor or fragrance a collaborative process between our researchers our product development team and our customers then follows to perfect the flavor or fragrance so that it is ready to be included in the final consumer product 

in addition to creating new flavors and fragrances our researchers and product development teams advise customers on ways to improve their existing products by adjusting or substituting current ingredients with more readily accessible or less expensive materials or by modifying the current ingredients to produce an enhanced yield this often results in creating a better value proposition for our customers 

our flavor and fragrance compound formulas are treated as trade secrets and remain our proprietary asset our business is not materially dependent upon any individual patent trademark or license 

supply chain 

we have an integrated supply chain from raw material sourcing through manufacturing quality assurance regulatory compliance and distribution which permits us to provide our customers with consistent quality products on a timely and costeffective basis 

procurement 

we use both natural and synthetic ingredients in our compounds we purchase approximately 9000 different raw materials from about 2500 domestic and international suppliers approximately half of the materials we purchase are naturals or croprelated items and the other half are synthetics and chemicals natural ingredients are derived from flowers fruits and other botanical products as well as from animal products they contain varying numbers of organic chemicals that are responsible for the fragrance or flavor of the natural product natural products are purchased in processed or semiprocessed form some are used in compounds in the state in which they are purchased and others are used after further processing natural products together with various chemicals are also used as raw materials for the manufacture of synthetic ingredients by chemical processes our flavor products also include extracts and seasonings derived from various fruits vegetables nuts herbs and spices as well as microbiologicallyderived ingredients we manufacture most of our synthetic ingredients for use in our fragrance compounds as well as for sale to others 

in order to ensure our supply of raw materials achieve favorable pricing and provide timely transparency regarding inflationary trends to our customers we continue to be focused on i implementing a forwardbuy strategy ii entering into supplier relationships to gain access to supplies that we do not have iii implementing indexed pricing iv reducing the complexity of our formulations and v evaluating whether it is more profitable to buy or make an ingredient we are also concentrating on local country sourcing with our own procurement professionals 

manufacturing and distribution 

we have 34 manufacturing sites around the world that support more than 38000 products our major manufacturing facilities are located in the united states the netherlands spain great britain turkey brazil mexico china india and singapore our supply chain initiatives in developing markets are focused on increasing capacity and investments in key technologies within our more mature markets we tend to focus on consolidation and cost optimization as well as implementing new technologies in addition to our own manufacturing facilities we develop relationships with third parties 

  8 

that permit us to expand access to the technologies capabilities and capacity that we need to better serve our customers 

based on the regional nature of the flavors business and the concerns regarding the transportability of raw materials we have established smaller manufacturing facilities in our local markets that are focused on local needs products within the fragrances business are typically composed of compounds that are more stable and more transportable around the world consequently we have fewer manufacturing facilities within our fragrances business which produce compounds and ingredients for global distribution 

in 2015 we continued to invest in our facilities we expanded our flavors facility located near johannesburg south africa to add flavor creation application and sensory laboratories and a pilot plant we opened a new flavors facility in the us near chicago illinois and a new creative center and expansion of our manufacturing facilities in gebze turkey in addition to ongoing construction of a new manufacturing facility in jakarta indonesia we recently approved a new capital project to construct a second manufacturing facility in china and also initiated a study regarding our existing footprint and manufacturing capabilities that serve the indian market 

sustainability 

as a leading global creator of flavors and fragrances for a wide variety of consumer products sustainability has been an important part of how we do business our sustainability strategy which is closely aligned with our vision 2020 strategy was first formalized in 2011 and consists of four pillars our products our impact our sources and our people while the industry and our company constantly evolve we are committed to conducting our business in line with our dedication to the environment to society and to the shareholders customers and others that have placed their confidence in us in 2015 we became a member of the world business council for sustainable development we also became the first flavors and fragrances company to join the together for sustainability initiative and enter into growing consortium of multinational companies committed to ensuring sustainable practices throughout the supply chain we were recognized by the cdp earning a perfect score of 100 in disclosure and an a in performance for our strategies and actions to mitigate climate change in addition ifflmr naturals received its fourth for life social responsibility designation in cooperation with our vetiver partner in haiti the for life designation recognizes an organization’s adherence to specific sustainability criteria including transparency environmental responsibility fair working conditions and positive relations with producers and local communities

we develop produce and market our products in a number of jurisdictions throughout the world and are subject to federal regional and local legislation and regulations in each of the various countries our flavor and many of our fragrance products are intended for the food beverage and pharmaceutical industries which are subject to strict quality and regulatory standards as a result we are required to meet these strict standards which in recent years have become increasingly stringent 

in addition we are subject to various rules relating to health work safety and the environment at the local and international levels in the various countries in which we operate our manufacturing facilities throughout the world are subject to environmental standards relating to air emissions sewage discharges the use of hazardous materials waste disposal practices and cleanup of existing environmental contamination in recent years there has been a significant increase in the stringency of environmental regulation and enforcement of environmental standards and the costs of compliance have risen significantly we expect that the trend of increased regulation will continue in the future 

our products and operations are subject to regulation by governmental agencies in each of the markets in which we operate these agencies include 1 the food and drug administration and equivalent international agencies that regulate flavors and other ingredients in consumer products 2 the environmental protection agency and equivalent international agencies that regulate our manufacturing facilities 3 the occupational safety and health administration and equivalent international agencies that regulate the working conditions in our manufacturing research laboratories and creative centers 4 local and international agencies that regulate trade and customs 5 the drug enforcement administration and other local or international agencies that regulate controlled chemicals that we use in our operations and 6 the chemical registrationnotification authorities that regulate chemicals that we use in or transport to the various countries in which we manufacture andor market our products we have seen an increase in registration and reporting requirements concerning the use of certain chemicals in a number of countries 

competition 

the flavors and fragrances market is part of a larger market which supplies a variety of ingredients and components 

  9 

that consumer products companies utilize in their products the broader market includes large multinational companies or smaller regional and local participants which supply products such as seasonings texturizers spices enzymes certain foodrelated commodities fortified products and cosmetic ingredients 

the market for flavors and fragrances is highly competitive based on annual sales our main competitors consist of 1 the three other large global flavor and fragrance manufacturers givaudan firmenich and symrise 2 midsized companies 3 numerous local and regional manufacturers and 4 consumer product companies who may develop their own flavors or fragrances we together with the other top three companies represent approximately twothirds of the total estimated sales in the global flavors and fragrances subsegment of the broader market 

we believe that our ability to compete successfully in the flavors and fragrances submarket is based on 1 our understanding of consumers 2 innovation arising from the creative skills of our perfumers and flavorists and the technological advances resulting from our research and development activities 3 our ability to create products which are tailormade for our customers’ needs 4 developing strong customer intimacy and 5 driving efficiency in all that we do 

large multinational customers and increasingly midsized customers may limit the number of their suppliers by placing some on “core lists” giving them priority for development and production of their new or modified products 

to compete more successfully in this environment we must make continued investments in customer relationships and tailor our research and development efforts to anticipate customers’ needs provide effective service and secure and maintain inclusion on certain “core lists” 

employee relations 

at december 31 2015  we had approximately 6700 employees worldwide of whom approximately 1550 are employed in the united states we believe that relations with our employees are good

risk factors 

tableend

we routinely encounter and address risks in conducting our business some of these risks may cause our future results to be different  sometimes materially different  than we presently anticipate below are certain important operational and strategic risks that could adversely affect our business how we react to material future developments as well as how our competitors react to those developments could also affect our future results 

our business is highly competitive and if we are unable to compete effectively our sales and results of operations will suffer 

the market for flavors and fragrances is highly competitive we face vigorous competition from companies throughout the world including multinational and specialized flavor fragrance and cosmetic ingredients companies as well as consumer product companies who may develop their own flavors fragrances or cosmetic ingredients in the flavors industry we also face increasing competition from ingredient suppliers that have expanded their portfolios to include flavor offerings some of our competitors specialize in one or more of our product subsegments while others participate in many of our product subsegments in addition some of our global competitors may have greater resources than we do or may have proprietary products that could permit them to respond to changing business and economic conditions more effectively than we can consolidation of our competitors may exacerbate these risks as we are new to cosmetic ingredients we may face greater competitionrelated risks in this industry than with our core historic flavor and fragrances business 

competition in our business is based on innovation product quality regulatory compliance pricing quality of customer service the support provided by marketing and application groups and understanding of consumers it is difficult for us to predict the timing scale and success of our competitors’ actions in these areas the discovery and development of new flavor and fragrance materials protection of the company’s intellectual property and development and retention of key employees are important issues in our ability to compete in our business increased competition by existing or future competitors including aggressive price competition could result in the potential loss of substantial sales or create the need for us to reduce prices or increase spending and this could have an adverse impact on sales and profitability 

during 2015 our 25 largest customers accounted for 52 of our sales and sales to our largest customer accounted for 12 of our sales in each of the last three fiscal years disruption of sales to this customer or any of our other large customers for an extended period of time could adversely affect our business or financial results 

large multinational customers and increasingly midsized customers are unilaterally limiting the number of their suppliers or rationalizing the number of products that they offer to increase their margins and profitability as part of these initiatives these customers are creating “core lists” of suppliers and giving these “core lists” suppliers priority for new or modified products recently these customers are making inclusion on their “core lists” contingent upon a supplier providing more favorable commercial terms which may adversely affect our margins these and other profitability initiatives being pursued by our customers reduce the market opportunity for which we compete and subject the volume and pricing of the remaining suppliers to downward pressure to compete more successfully in this environment we must continue to make investments in customer relationships and tailor product research and development in order to anticipate customers’ needs deliver supplies that contribute to our customers’ profitability provide effective service and offer competitive costinuse solutions to secure and maintain inclusion on certain “core lists” and our share of our customers’ purchases if we are unable to do so it could adversely impact our future results of operations 

we may not be able to successfully identify and complete sufficient acquisitions to meet our vision 2020 strategy and even if we are able to do so we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions 

as part of our new vision 2020 strategy we intend to add between 500 million and 10 billion of sales growth through acquisitions within the flavors and fragrances industries and adjacencies during 2015 we negotiated and closed two acquisitions which align with this strategic objective specifically in may 2015 we completed the acquisition of ottens 

  12 

flavors a flavor supplier and developer and in july 2015 we completed the acquisition of lucas meyer cosmetics a developer manufacturer and marketer of cosmetic active ingredients 

identifying suitable acquisition candidates can be difficult timeconsuming and costly and we may not be able to identify suitable candidates or complete acquisitions in a timely manner on a costeffective basis or at all even if we complete an acquisition we may not realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisition our recent acquisitions have required and any similar future transactions may also require significant efforts and expenditures including with respect to integrating the acquired business with our historical business we may encounter unexpected difficulties or incur unexpected costs in connection with acquisition activities and integration efforts which include 

 if any of our acquisitions do not perform as anticipated for any of the reasons noted above or otherwise there could be a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

the failure of key information technology systems or a breach of our information security may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business subject us to increased operating costs and expose us to litigation 

we rely on information technology systems including some managed by thirdparty providers to conduct business and support our business processes including product formulas product development sales order processing production distribution finance and intracompany communications throughout the world these systems may be susceptible to disruptions or outages due to fire floods power loss telecommunications failures natural disasters cyber attacks and similar events or due to the poor performance of thirdparty providers effective response to such disruptions will require effort and diligence on the part of our employees and thirdparty providers to avoid any adverse impact to our business in addition our systems and proprietary data stored electronically may be vulnerable to computer viruses cybercrime computer hacking and similar information security breaches which in turn could result in the unauthorized release or misuse of confidential or proprietary information about our business including but not limited to the trade secrets upon which we rely to protect our proprietary fragrance and flavor formulations employees or customers and disrupt our operations depending on their nature and scope these threats could potentially lead to improper use of our systems and networks manipulation and destruction of data or product noncompliance the occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our sales subject us to increased operating costs and expose us to litigation 

the industries in which our customers operate are expanding and becoming increasingly decentralized and if we andor our customers are unable to adjust our operating results and future growth may be adversely affected 

our customers include large food and beverage companies which operate in highly competitive industries and rely on continued consumer demand for their products in recent years many of our customers have faced growing competition from midsize regional companies and companies focused on nicheproduct categories driving and accelerating product innovation consequently the food and beverage industry is expanding and becoming increasingly decentralized if our customers fail to adequately address the challenges pertaining to this expansion and decentralization of business it may adversely affect their operations or financial performance and could have a corresponding material adverse effect on us if our global customers’ 

  13 

market shares continue to erode and we are unable to gain market share with small and midsized customers in this evolved environment our operating results and future growth could be adversely affected 

we have made investments in and are expanding our business into emerging markets which exposes us to certain risks 

as part of our growth strategy we have increased our presence in emerging markets by expanding our manufacturing presence sales organization and product offerings in these markets and we expect to continue to focus on expanding our business in these markets in addition to the currency and international operation risks described below our operations in these markets may be subject to a variety of other risks emerging markets typically have a consumer base with limited or fluctuating disposable income and customer demand in these markets may fluctuate accordingly as a result decrease in customer demand in emerging markets may have an adverse effect on our ability to execute our growth strategy in addition emerging markets may have weak legal systems which may affect our ability to enforce our intellectual property and contractual rights exchange controls unstable governments and privatization or other government actions that may affect taxes subsidies and incentive programs and the flow of goods and currency in conducting our business we move products from one country to another and may provide services in one country from a subsidiary located in another country accordingly we are vulnerable to abrupt changes in customs and tax regimes that may have significant negative impacts on our financial condition and operating results 

we may not successfully develop and introduce new products that meet our customers’ needs which may adversely affect our results of operations 

our ability to differentiate ourselves and deliver growth in line with our vision 2020 strategy largely depends on our ability to successfully develop and introduce new products and product improvements that meet our customers’ needs and ultimately appeal to consumers innovation is a key element of our ability to develop and introduce new products we cannot be certain that we will successfully achieve our innovation goals such as the development of new molecules new and expanded delivery systems and other technologies we currently spend approximately 8 of our sales on research and development however such investments may only generate future revenues to the extent that we are able to successfully develop products that meet our customers’ specifications can be delivered at an acceptable cost in use and are accepted by the targeted consumer market furthermore there may be significant lag times from the time we incur rd costs to the time that these rd costs may result in increased revenue consequently even when we “win” a project our ability to generate revenues as a result of these investments is subject to numerous customer economic and other risks that are outside of our control including delays by our customers in the launch of a new product the level of promotional support for the launch poor performance of our thirdparty vendors anticipated sales by our customers not being realized or changes in market preferences or demands or disruptive innovations by competitors 

increasing awareness of health and wellness are driving changes in the consumer products industry and if we are unable to react in a timely and costeffective manner our results of operations and future growth may be adversely affected 

we must continually anticipate and react in a timely and costeffective manner to changes in consumer preferences and demands including changes in demand driven by increasing awareness of health and wellness and demands for transparency with respect to product ingredients consumers especially in developed economies such as the united states and western europe are shifting away from products containing artificial ingredients to “all natural” healthier alternatives in addition there has been a growing demand by consumers and governmental agencies to provide more transparency in product labeling and our customers have been taking steps to address this demand including by voluntarily providing productspecific fragrance ingredients disclosure these two trends could affect the types and volumes of our flavors and fragrances that our customers include in their product offerings if we are unable to react to or anticipate these trends in a timely and costeffective manner our results of operations and future growth may be adversely affected 

we may not succeed in establishing and maintaining collaborations joint ventures or partnerships and such arrangements may not lead to development or commercialization of products which may limit our ability to execute our vision 2020 strategy and adversely affect our future growth 

from time to time and in line with our new vision 2020 strategy we may evaluate and enter into collaborations joint ventures or partnerships to enhance our research and development efforts our ability to generate revenues from such collaborations will depend on our partners’ abilities and efforts to successfully perform the functions assigned to them in these arrangements the process of establishing and maintaining collaborative relationships is difficult timeconsuming to negotiate document and implement we may not be successful in our efforts to establish and implement collaborations or other alternative arrangements should we choose to enter into such arrangements and the terms of the arrangements may not be favorable to us additionally collaborations may not lead to development or commercialization of products in the most efficient manner or at all if we are 

  14 

unable to establish and maintain collaborative relationships on acceptable terms or to successfully transition terminated collaborative agreements it could limit our ability to execute our vision 2020 strategy and adversely affect our future growth 

the impact of currency fluctuation or devaluation in the international markets in which we operate may negatively affect our results of operations 

we have significant operations outside the united states the results of which are reported in the local currency and then translated into united states dollars at applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements the exchange rates between these currencies and the united states dollar have fluctuated and will continue to do so in the future changes in exchange rates between these local currencies and the united states dollar will affect the recorded levels of sales profitability assets andor liabilities for example the weakening of the euro and several emerging market currencies in 2015 resulted in approximately 33 million impact on operating profit versus 2014 additionally volatility in currency exchange rates may adversely impact our financial condition cash flows or liquidity although we employ a variety of techniques to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations including sourcing strategies and a limited number of foreign currency hedging activities we cannot guarantee that such hedging and risk management strategies will be effective and our results of operations could be adversely affected 

our international operations are subject to regulatory political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues cash flows or financial position 

we operate on a global basis with manufacturing and sales facilities in the united states europe africa the middle east latin america and greater asia during 2015 77 of our net sales were to customers outside the united states and we intend to continue expansion of our international operations as a result our business is increasingly exposed to risks inherent in international operations these risks which can vary substantially by location are also described in many of the risk factors in this section and include the following 

 these factors may increase in importance as we expand our operations in emerging markets as part of our growth strategy and the occurrence of any one or more of these factors could increase our costs and adversely affect our results of operations 

  15 

volatility and challenging economic conditions may adversely affect demand for consumer products using flavors and fragrances including cosmetic active ingredients may have a negative impact on our operating results and future growth 

our flavors and fragrances including cosmetic active ingredients are components of a wide assortment of global consumer products throughout the world historically demand for consumer products using flavors and fragrances including cosmetic active ingredients was stimulated and broadened by changing social habits and consumer needs population growth an expanding global middleclass and general economic growth especially in emerging markets the global economy has experienced significant recessionary pressures and declines in consumer confidence and economic growth while some segments of the global economy appear to be recovering the ongoing global recessionary economic environment in europe has and may in the near future increase unemployment and underemployment decrease salaries and wage rates increase inflation or result in other marketwide cost pressures that will adversely affect demand for consumer products in both developed and emerging markets 

in addition growth rates in the emerging markets have moderated from previous levels reduced consumer spending may cause changes in our customer orders including reduced demand for our flavors and fragrances including cosmetic active ingredients or order cancellations for example recent challenging economic conditions in china and latin america which culminated in the weakening of the chinese yuan brazilian real and argentinian peso have undermined consumer confidence and resulted in our customers throughout the emerging markets taking a more cautious approach to managing their inventory 

the timing of placing of orders and the amounts of these orders are generally at our customers discretion customers may cancel reduce or postpone orders with us on relatively short notice significant cancellations reductions or delays in orders by customers could affect our quarterly results 

it is currently anticipated that these challenging economic conditions will continue during 2016 to the extent that the volatility in global economic conditions continues our sales profitability and overall operating results could be adversely affected 

our success depends on attracting and retaining talented people within our business significant shortfalls in recruitment or retention could adversely affect our ability to compete and achieve our strategic goals 

attracting developing and retaining talented employees including our perfumers and flavorists is essential to the successful delivery of our products and success in the marketplace competition for these employees can be intense the ability to attract and retain talented employees is critical in the development of new products and technologies which is an integral component of our growth strategy however we may not be able to attract and retain such employees in the future if we experience significant shortfalls in recruitment or retention our ability to effectively compete with our competitors and to grow our business could be adversely affected 

failure to comply with environmental protection laws may cause us to close relocate or operate one or more of our plants at reduced production levels which could adversely affect our operating results and future growth 

our business operations and properties are subject to extensive and increasingly stringent federal state local and foreign laws and regulations pertaining to protection of the environment including air emissions sewage discharges the use of hazardous materials waste disposal practices and cleanup of existing environmental contamination failure to comply with these laws and regulations or any future changes to them may result in significant consequences to us including the need to close or relocate one or more of our production facilities administrative civil and criminal penalties liability for damages and negative publicity if we are unable to meet production requirements we can lose customer orders which can adversely affect our future growth or we may be required to make incremental capital investments to ensure supply for example in 2015 chinese authorities notified us of compliance issues pertaining to the emission of odors from several of our plants in china and consequently our flavors facility in china was temporarily idled and another facility was required to modify its production schedule as a result of these issues we invested approximately 65 million in odorabatement equipment at these facilities and have approved a new capital project of approximately 45 million to construct a second flavors manufacturing facility in china such idling of facilities or production modifications has caused or may cause customers to seek alternate suppliers due to concerns regarding supply interruptions and these customers may not return or may order at reduced levels even once issues are remediated if these noncompliance issues reoccur in china or occur or in any other jurisdiction we may lose business and may be required to incur capital spending above previous expectations close a plant or operate a plant at significantly reduced production levels on a permanent basis and our operating results and cash flows from operations may be adversely affected 

our ongoing optimization of our manufacturing facilities may not be as effective as we anticipate and we may fail to realize the expected cost savings and increased efficiencies 

  16 

as part of our strategy we seek to enhance our manufacturing efficiency and align our geographic manufacturing footprint with our expectations of future growth and technology needs many of our facilities are located in close proximity to our customers in order to minimize both our customers’ and our own costs however we may not have sufficient demand to utilize all of our production capacity and may be required to ship excess products to other regions in which we operate which will increase our costs and decrease our margins to operate more efficiently and control costs from time to time we also execute rationalization activities which include manufacturing facility consolidations for example we are in the midst of relocating our ingredients facility in hangzhou china and constructing a new flavors site in indonesia we have also initiated a study regarding our existing footprint and manufacturing capabilities that serve the indian market the spending associated with these projects may result in capital spending above previous expectations our ability to realize anticipated cost savings synergies and revenue enhancements from these activities may be affected by a number of factors and may pose significant risks including 

 furthermore our rationalization and consolidation actions may not be as effective as we anticipate and we may fail to realize the cost savings we expect from these actions actual charges costs and adjustments due to these activities may vary materially from our estimates and these activities may require cash and noncash integration and implementation costs or charges in excess of budgeted amounts which could offset any such savings and other synergies and therefore could have an adverse effect on our margins 

volatility and increases in the price of raw materials energy and transportation could harm our profits 

we use many different raw materials for our business including essential oils extracts and concentrates derived from fruits vegetables flowers woods and other botanicals animal products raw fruits organic chemicals and petroleumbased chemicals while raw material costs have been relatively stable during 2015 historically we have experienced a considerable amount of price volatility in natural products that represent approximately half of our raw material purchases availability and pricing of these natural products can be impacted by crop size and quality weather alternative land use and other factors which we cannot control 

if we are unable to increase the prices to our customers of our fragrance or flavor products to offset raw material and other input cost increases or if we are unable to achieve cost savings to offset such cost increases we could fail to meet our cost expectations and our profits and operating results could be adversely affected increases in prices of our products to customers may lead to declines in volume and we may not be able to accurately predict the volume impact of price increases which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

similarly commodities and energy prices are subject to significant volatility caused by market fluctuations supply and demand currency fluctuations production and transportation disruptions and other world events as we source many of our raw materials globally to help ensure quality control if the cost of energy shipping or transportation increases and we are unable to pass along these costs to our customers our profit margins would be adversely affected furthermore increasing our prices to our customers could result in longterm sales declines or loss of market share if our customers find alternative suppliers or choose to reformulate their consumer products to use fewer ingredients which could have an adverse longterm impact on our results of operations 

to mitigate our sourcing risk we maintain strategic stock levels for critical items however if we do not accurately estimate the amount of raw materials that will be used for the geographic region in which we will need these materials our margins could be adversely affected 

our reliance on a limited base of suppliers may result in a disruption to our business and may adversely affect our financial results 

  17 

for certain raw materials we rely on a limited number of suppliers and we may not have readily available alternatives if we are unable to maintain our supplier arrangements and relationships and are unable to obtain the quantity quality and price levels needed for our business or if any of our key suppliers becomes insolvent or experiences other financial distress we could experience disruptions in production and our financial results could be adversely affected 

if we are unable to maintain the integrity of our raw materials supply chain and finished goods it may result in regulatory noncompliance litigation costs and harm to our reputation all of which may adversely impact sales and our results of operations 

the development manufacture and sale of our products are subject to various regulatory requirements in each of the countries in which our products are developed manufactured and sold in addition we are subject to product safety and compliance requirements established by the industry or similar oversight bodies we use a variety of strategies methodologies and tools to i identify current product standards ii assess relative risks in our supply chain that can impact product integrity iii monitor internal and external performance and iv test raw materials and finished goods to minimize the likelihood of product or process noncompliance 

gaps in our operational processes could adversely affect the quality of our finished products and result in a regulatory noncompliance event if a product noncompliance event were to go undetected it could subject us to customer claims recalls penalties litigation costs and settlements remediation costs or loss of sales as our flavors fragrances and cosmetic actives are used as ingredients in many products meant for human use or consumption these consequences would be exacerbated if we or our customer did not identify the defect before the product reaches the consumer and there was a resulting impact at the consumer level such a result could lead to potentially large scale adverse publicity recalls and potential consumer litigation furthermore adverse publicity about our products including concerns about product safety or similar issues whether real or perceived could harm our reputation and result in an immediate adverse effect on our sales and customer relationships as well as require us to utilize significant resources to rebuild our reputation 

a disruption in our operations or our supply chain could adversely affect our business and financial results 

as a company engaged in research and development manufacturing and distribution on a global scale we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities including industrial accidents environmental events strikes and other labor disputes disruptions in supply chain or information systemsdisruption or loss of key research or manufacturing sites product quality control safety licensing requirements and other regulatory issues as well as natural disasters and other external factors over which we have no control while we have research and development and manufacturing facilities throughout the world many of these facilities are extremely specialized and certain of our facilities are the sole source of a specific ingredient or product if our research and development activities or the manufacturing of ingredients or products were disrupted the cost of relocating or replacing these activities or reformulating these ingredients or products may be substantial which could result in production or development delays or otherwise have an adverse effect on our margins operating results and future growth 

our performance may be adversely impacted if we are not successful in managing our inventory andor working capital balances 

we evaluate our inventory balances of materials based on shelf life expected sourcing levels known uses and anticipated demand based on forecasted customer order activity and changes in our productsales mix efficient inventory management is a key component of our business success financial returns and profitability to be successful we must maintain sufficient inventory levels and an appropriate productsales mix to meet our customers’ demands without allowing those levels to increase to such an extent that the costs associated with storing and holding other inventory adversely impact our financial results if our buying decisions do not accurately predict sourcing levels customer trends or our expectations about customer needs are inaccurate we may have to take unanticipated markdowns or impairment charges to dispose of the excess or obsolete inventory which can adversely impact our financial results additionally we believe excess inventory levels of raw materials with a short shelf life in our manufacturing facilities subjects us to the risk of increased inventory shrinkage if we are not successful in managing our inventory balances and shrinkage our results of and cash flows from operations may be negatively affected 

we sell certain accounts receivable on a nonrecourse basis to unrelated financial institutions under “factoring” agreements that are sponsored solely and individually by certain customers the cost of participating in these programs was immaterial to our results in all periods should we choose not to participate or if these programs were no longer available it could reduce our cash flows from operations in the period in which the arrangement ends 

  18 

we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act or similar us or foreign antibribery and anticorruption laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate 

the global nature of our business the significance of our international revenue and our focus on emerging markets create various domestic and local regulatory challenges and subject us to risks associated with our international operations the us foreign corrupt practices act or fcpa and similar antibribery and anticorruption laws and regulations in other countries generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or for other commercial advantage in addition us public companies are required to maintain records that accurately and fairly represent their transactions and have an adequate system of internal accounting controls under the fcpa us companies may be held liable for the corrupt actions taken by directors officers employees agents or other strategic or local partners or representatives as such if we or our intermediaries fail to comply with the requirements of the fcpa or similar legislation governmental authorities in the united states and elsewhere could seek to impose substantial civil andor criminal fines and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation operating results and financial condition 

we operate or may pursue opportunities in some jurisdictions such as china india brazil and africa which pose potentially elevated risks of fraud or corruption or increased risk of internal control issues in certain jurisdictions compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices from time to time we have conducted and will conduct internal investigations of the relevant facts and circumstances control testing and compliance reviews and take remedial actions when appropriate to help ensure that we are in compliance with applicable corruption and similar laws and regulations detecting investigating and resolving actual or alleged violations of the fcpa or similar laws is expensive and could consume significant time and attention of our senior management we could be subject to inquiries or investigations by government and other regulatory bodies any allegations of noncompliance with the fcpa or similar laws could have a disruptive effect on our operations in such jurisdiction over the near term including interruptions of business or loss of thirdparty relationships which may negatively impact our results of operations or financial condition any determination that our operations or activities are not in compliance with the fcpa or similar laws could expose us to severe criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions significant fines termination of necessary licenses and permits and penalties or other sanctions that may harm our business and reputation 

our ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights 

we rely on patents and trade secrets to protect our intellectual property rights we often rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary fragrance and flavor formulations as this does not require us to publicly file information regarding our intellectual property from time to time a third party may claim that we have infringed upon or misappropriated their intellectual property rights or a third party may infringe upon or misappropriate our intellectual property rights we could incur significant costs in connection with legal actions to assert our intellectual property rights against third parties or to defend ourselves from third party assertions of invalidity infringement or misappropriation or other claims any settlement or adverse judgment resulting from such litigation could require us to obtain a license to continue to use the intellectual property rights that are the subject of the claim or otherwise restrict or prohibit our use of such intellectual property rights any required licensing fees may not be available to us on acceptable terms if at all for those intellectual property rights that are protected as trade secrets this litigation could result in even higher costs and potentially the loss of certain rights since we would not have a perfected intellectual property right that precludes others from making using or selling our products or processes the ongoing trend among our customers towards more transparent labeling could further diminish our ability to effectively protect our proprietary flavor formulations 

for intellectual property rights that we seek to protect through patents we cannot be certain that these rights if obtained will not later be opposed invalidated or circumvented in addition even if such rights are obtained in the united states the laws of some of the other countries in which our products are or may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states if other parties were to infringe on our intellectual property rights or if a third party successfully asserted that we had infringed on their intellectual property rights it could materially and adversely affect our future results of operations by i reducing the price that we could obtain in the marketplace for products which are based on such rights ii increasing the royalty or other fees that we may be required to pay in connection with such rights or iii limiting the volume if any of such products that we can sell 

our results of operations may be negatively impacted by the outcome of uncertainties related to litigation 

from time to time we are involved in a number of legal claims and litigation including claims related to intellectual property product liability environmental matters and indirect taxes we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of such litigation in addition we cannot provide assurance that future events will not result in an increase in the number of claims or require an 

  19 

increase in the amount accrued for any such claims or require accrual for one or more claims that has not been previously accrued in addition if we were found liable we could be subject to certain indemnification claims there can be no assurance that our insurance will be adequate to protect us from all material expenses related to pending and future claims or that such levels of insurance will be available in the future at economical prices 

the level of returns on pension and postretirement plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used for valuation purposes could affect our earnings and cash flows in future periods changes in government regulations could also affect our pension and postretirement plan expenses and funding requirements 

the funding obligations for our pension plans are impacted by the performance of the financial markets particularly the equity markets and interest rates funding obligations are determined under government regulations and are measured each year based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date if the financial markets do not provide the longterm returns that are expected under the governmental funding calculations we could be required to make larger contributions the equity markets can be very volatile and therefore our estimate of future contribution requirements can change dramatically in relatively short periods of time similarly changes in interest rates and legislation enacted by governmental authorities can impact the timing and amounts of contribution requirements an adverse change in the funded status of the plans could significantly increase our required contributions in the future and adversely impact our liquidity 

assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans are determined by us in consultation with outside consultants and advisors in the event that we determine that changes are warranted in the assumptions used such as the discount rate expected longterm rate of return on assets or expected health care costs our future pension and postretirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease due to changing market conditions or changes in the participant population the assumptions that we use may differ from actual results which could have a significant impact on our pension and postretirement liabilities and related costs and funding requirements 

any future impairment of our tangible or intangible longlived assets may adversely impact our profitability 

a significant portion of our assets consists of longlived assets including tangible assets such as our manufacturing facilities and intangible assets and goodwill as of december 31 2015 we had recorded 12 billion  of intangible assets and goodwill including goodwill and intangible assets related to our acquisitions longlived assets are subject to an impairment analysis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable additionally goodwill is subject to an impairment test at least annually indicators such as underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results changes in the company’s strategy for its overall business or use of acquired assets unexpected negative industry or economic trends decreased market capitalization relative to net book values unanticipated competitive activities change in consumer demand loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts may signal that an asset has become impaired to the extent any of our acquisitions do not perform as anticipated whether due to internal or external factors the value of such assets may be negatively affected and we may be required to record impairment charges our results of operations and financial position in future periods could be negatively impacted should future impairments of our longlived assets including intangible assets or goodwill occur 

changes in our tax rates the adoption of new united states or international tax legislation or changes in existing tax laws could expose us to additional tax liabilities that may affect our future results 

we are subject to taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in liabilities for uncertain tax positions cost of repatriations or changes in tax laws or their interpretation any of these changes could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 

we have and will continue to implement transfer pricing policies among our various operations located in different countries these transfer pricing policies are a significant component of the management and compliance of our operations across international boundaries and overall financial results many countries routinely examine transfer pricing policies of taxpayers subject to their jurisdiction challenge transfer pricing policies aggressively where there is potential noncompliance and impose significant interest charges and penalties where noncompliance is determined there can be no assurance that a governmental authority will not challenge these policies more aggressively in the future or if challenged that we will prevail we could suffer significant costs related to one or more challenges to our transfer pricing 

we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and foreign tax authorities in those countries in which we operate and we may be subject to assessments or audits in the future in any of the 

  20 

countries in which we operate the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals and while we do not believe the results that follow would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition such results could have a material effect on our income tax provision net income or cash flows in the period or periods in which that determination is made 

in addition a number of international legislative and regulatory bodies have proposed legislation and begun investigations of the tax practices of multinational companies and in the european union “eu” the tax policies of certain eu member states one of these efforts has been led by the oecd an international association of 34 countries including the united states which has finalized recommendations to revise corporate tax transfer pricing and tax treaty provisions in member countries since 2013 the european commission “ec” has been investigating tax rulings granted by tax authorities in a number of eu member states with respect to specific multinational corporations to determine whether such rulings comply with eu rules on state aid as well as more recent investigations of the tax regimes of certain eu member states under eu law selective tax advantages for particular taxpayers that are not sufficiently grounded in economic realities may constitute impermissible state aid if the ec determines that a tax ruling or tax regime violates the state aid restrictions the tax authorities of the affected eu member state may be required to collect back taxes for the period of time covered by the ruling in late 2015 and early 2016 the ec declared that tax rulings by tax authorities in luxembourg the netherlands and belgium did not comply with the eu state aid restrictions if the ec were to successfully challenge tax rulings applicable to us in any of the eu member states in which we are subject to taxation we could be exposed to increased tax liabilities 

our operations may be affected by greenhouse emissions and climate change and related regulations 

the availability of raw materials and energy supplies fluctuate in markets throughout the world climate change may also affect the availability and price of key raw materials including natural products used in the manufacture of our products in order to mitigate the risk of price increases and shortages our purchasers have developed various sourcing strategies including multiple suppliers inventory management systems various geographic suppliers and longterm agreements to mitigate risk 

in addition to market forces there are various regulatory efforts relating to climate change that may increase the cost of raw materials particularly energy used to operate our facilities that could materially impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the potential government regulation of certain of our product development initiatives is uncertain and we may be subject to adverse consequences if we fail to comply with applicable regulations 

as part of our ingredients research program we seek to collaborate with research institutions and companies throughout the world including biotechnology companies however it is unclear whether any of our product developments will be classified as genetically modified food products subject to regulation as a biotechnology product the manufacture of biotechnology products is subject to applicable current good manufacturing practice cgmp regulations as prescribed by the food and drug administration and the applicable standards prescribed by european commission and the competent authorities of european union member states and to other rules and regulations prescribed by foreign regulatory authorities compliance with these regulations can be expensive and time consuming such regulation could also subject us to requirements for labeling and traceability which may cause our customers to avoid our affected products and seek our competitors’ products this may result in our inability to realize any benefit from our investment and have an adverse effect on our operating results

legal proceedings 

tableend

we are subject to various claims and legal actions in the ordinary course of our business 

tax claims 

during 2013 the company reached a settlement with the spanish tax authorities with respect to assesments imposed in connection with the 2011 fiscal year audit and paid euro 39 million 52 million based on the exchange rate at the payment date 

with respect to the audits of 20022003 fiscal years the spanish tax authorities imposed assessments aggregating euro 224 million 286 million including aggregate estimated interest the company appealed these assessments however in february 2013 the appellate court upheld the administrative ruling with respect to the 2003 tax assessment and the related tax avoidance claims the company decided not to pursue the appeals process with respect to the 2003 tax assessment and paid euro 208 million 273 million based on the exchange rate at the respective payment dates in connection with the 2003 tax assessment in 2013 in june 2013 the appellate court ruled against us on our appeal of the 2002 income tax assessment and related claims which the company also decided not to appeal however this case did not have a related tax exposure associated with it in an unrelated matter there was a remaining aggregate assessment related to the 2002 fiscal year of euro 19 million 23 million as of december 31 2014 which was under appeal during the first quarter of 2015 the company received a favorable ruling on this appeal and accordingly reversed the total reserve related to the 2002 fiscal year with a value of euro 19 million or 23 million 

in addition to the above the company was also a party to four dividend withholding tax controversies in spain in which the spanish tax authorities alleged that the company’s spanish subsidiaries underpaid withholding taxes during the 19952001 fiscal years the company had previously appealed each of these controversies during 2012 the company received unfavorable decisions on the first three cases as a result of these rulings during 2012 the company i recorded charges including estimated interest of approximately 120 million aftertax and ii made payments of euro 98 million 128 million based on exchange rate at the respective payment dates the fourth case was heard by the spanish national high court in october 2014 and we received a favorable ruling accordingly during the fourth quarter of 2014 we reversed the total reserve related to the 2001 fiscal year with a value of euro 36 million of 43 million as of december 31 2015  all dividend withholding tax controversies in spain have now been resolved the company made total payments of euro 45 million 49 million during the second quarter of 2015 related to the resolution of the three controversies 

  23 

separately the spanish tax authorities alleged claims for a capital tax in a case arising from similar allegations as the income tax cases discussed in further detail in note 10 in connection with the 2002 income tax assessment ruling discussed in note 10 the appellate court rejected one of the two bases upon which we based our capital tax position on january 22 2014 we filed an appeal and in order to avoid future interest costs in the event our appeal was unsuccessful we paid euro 98 million 112 million representing the principal amount during the first quarter of 2014 on february 24 2016 we received a favorable ruling on our appeal from the spanish supreme court which overruled a lower court ruling as a result of this decision we have reversed the previously recorded provision of euro 98 million 105 million for the year ended december 31 2015 

we do not currently believe that any of our pending tax assessments even if ultimately resolved against us would have a material impact on our financial condition 

environmental 

over the past 20 years various federal and state authorities and private parties have claimed that we are a potentially responsible party “prp” as a generator of waste materials for alleged pollution at a number of waste sites operated by third parties located principally in new jersey and have sought to recover costs incurred and to be incurred to clean up the sites 

we have been identified as a prp at eight facilities operated by third parties at which investigation andor remediation activities may be ongoing we analyze our potential liability on at least a quarterly basis we accrue for environmental liabilities when they are probable and estimable we estimate our share of the total future cost for these sites to be less than 5 million 

while joint and several liability is authorized under federal and state environmental laws we believe the amounts we have paid and anticipate paying in the future for cleanup costs and damages at all sites are not material and will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity this assessment is based upon among other things the involvement of other prps at most of the sites the status of the proceedings including various settlement agreements and consent decrees and the extended time period over which payments will likely be made there can be no assurance however that future events will not require us to materially increase the amounts we anticipate paying for cleanup costs and damages at these sites and that such increased amounts will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

other 

in march 2012 zoomessence inc filed a complaint against the company in the us district court of new jersey alleging trade secret misappropriation breach of contract and unjust enrichment in connection with certain spray dry technology disclosed to the company in connection with the claims zoomessence is seeking an injunction and monetary damages zoomessence initially sought a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction but the court denied these applications in an order entered on september 27 2013 finding that zoomessence had not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of its claims the court subsequently referred the matter to mediation however the private mediation session did not result in a resolution of the dispute on november 3 2014 zoomessence amended its complaint against the company to include allegations of breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing fraud in the inducement and misappropriation of confidential and proprietary information on november 13 2014 the company filed a counterclaim against zoomessence alleging trade secret misappropriation breach of contract breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing unjust enrichment misappropriation of confidential and proprietary information common law unfair competition tortious interference with contractual relations and conversion the case is currently proceeding through discovery with a trial on the merits anticipated in early 2017 the company denies the allegations and will vigorously defend and pursue its position in court at this stage of the litigation based on the information currently available to the company management does not believe that this matter represents a material loss contingency 

we are also a party to other litigation arising in the ordinary course of our business we do not expect the outcome of these cases singly or in the aggregate to have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition

overview 

company background 

we create manufacture and supply flavors and fragrances including cosmetic active ingredients that are used in the food beverage personal care and household products industries either in the form of compounds or individual ingredients including cosmetic active ingredients our flavors and fragrance compounds combine a number of ingredients that are blended mixed or reacted together to produce proprietary formulas created by our flavorists and perfumers 

flavors are the key building blocks that impart taste experiences in food and beverage products and as such play a significant role in determining consumer preference of the end products in which they are used as a leading creator of flavors we help our customers deliver on the promise of delicious and healthy foods and drinks that appeal to consumers while we are a global leader our flavors business is more regional in nature with different formulas that reflect local taste preferences our flavors compounds are ultimately used by our customers in four enduse categories 1 savory 2 beverages 3 sweet and 4 dairy 

we are a global leader in the creation of fragrance compounds that are integral elements in  the world’s finest perfumes and bestknown consumer products within fabric care home care personal wash hair care and toiletries products our fragrances business consists of fragrance compounds and fragrance ingredients our fragrance compounds are defined into broad categories 1 fine fragrances and 2 consumer fragrances consumer fragrances consists of five enduse categories of products 1 fabric care 2 home care 3 personal wash 4 hair care and 5 toiletries in addition fragrance ingredients that are used internally and sold to third parties including customers and competitors for use in preparation of compounds and cosmetic active ingredients which consist of active and functional ingredients are included in the fragrances business unit 

the flavors and fragrances market is part of a larger market which supplies a wide variety of ingredients and compounds that are used in consumer products the broader market includes large multinational companies or smaller regional and local participants which supply products such as seasonings texturizers spices enzymes certain foodrelated commodities fortified products and cosmetic active ingredients the global market for flavors and fragrances has expanded consistently primarily as a result of an increase in demand for as well as an increase in the variety of consumer products containing flavors and fragrances in 2014 the flavors and fragrances market in which we compete was estimated by management to be at least 18 billion and is forecasted to grow to approximately 216 billion by 2019 primarily driven by expected growth in emerging markets however the exact size of the global market is not available due to fragmentation of data we estimate the market size for cosmetic active ingredients to be approximately 15 billion as of 2015 we together with the other top three companies are estimated to represent approximately twothirds of the total estimated sales in the global flavors and fragrances subsegment of the broader market 

development of new flavors and fragrance compounds is driven by a variety of sources including requests from our customers who are in need of a specific flavor or fragrance for use in a new or modified consumer product or as a result of 

  31 

internal initiatives stemming from our consumer insights program our product development team works in partnership with our scientists and researchers to optimize the consumer appeal of the flavor or fragrance it then becomes a collaborative process between our researchers our product development team and our customers to perfect the flavor or fragrance so that it is ready to be included in the final consumer product 

2015 overview 

during the third quarter of 2015 we completed the acquisition of 100  of the outstanding shares of lucas meyer cosmetics a business of unipex group lucas meyer for approximately euro 2840 million   3120 million  the total shares acquired include shares effectively acquired pursuant to put and call option agreements this acquisition did not have a material impact on our consolidated statement of comprehensive income the acquisition strengthened and expanded fragrance ingredients 

during the second quarter of 2015 we completed the acquisition of 100  of the outstanding shares of henry h ottens manufacturing co inc ottens flavors for 1989 million  the acquisition did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements the acquisition strengthened our flavors market position in the targeted north american market 

our 25 largest customers accounted for 52 of total sales in 2015  this percentage has remained fairly constant for several years sales to our largest customer across all enduse categories accounted for 12 of our sales for each of the last three fiscal years a key factor for commercial success is inclusion on our strategic customers’ core supplier lists which provides opportunities to win new business we are on the core supplier lists of a large majority of our global and strategic customers within fragrances and flavors 

sales in 2015  declined 2  on a reported basis but increased 5  on a currency neutral basis which excludes the effects of changes in currency with the effects of acquisitions contributing approximately 2  to both reported and currency neutral basis growth rates flavors achieved currency neutral growth of 6  including approximately half of the growth coming from acquisitions fragrances achieved currency neutral growth of 4  in 2015  including approximately a quarter of the growth coming from acquisitions the currency neutral growth of 3  excluding acquisitions reflects new win performance net of losses in both flavors and fragrance compounds partially offset by volume erosion on existing business principally driven by our customers product line rationalization and inventory management efforts in addition our flavors business was negatively impacted by volume erosion in north america noam as well as weak demand and lost business in china principally associated with facility issues additionally fragrance ingredients sales were up 2  which was driven entirely by the inclusion of acquisitions overall our 2015  results continued to be driven by our strong emerging market presence that represented 51 of total sales and experienced 5 currency neutral growth in 2015  from a geographic perspective all regions delivered currency neutral growth on a consolidated basis in 2015  led by latin america la with 9 currency neutral sales growth 

the year 2014 included an extra week of activity due to the timing of our fiscal yearend as discussed in note 1 of the consolidated financial statements the impact of this week was not material to our results of operations for the year ended december 31 2014

2015  sales by business unit 



  



financial performance overview 

reported sales for 2015  decreased 2  yearoveryear including approximately 2  growth from acquisitions we continue to benefit from our diverse portfolio of enduse product categories and geographies and had currency neutral sales growth in all four regions and in consumer fragrances and flavor compounds both flavors and fragrances benefited from new win performance net of losses and the effect of acquisitions that were partially offset by volume erosion on existing business principally driven by our customers product line rationalization and inventory management efforts in addition our flavors business was negatively impacted by volume erosion in noam as well as weak demand and lost business in china principally associated with facility issues exchange rate variations represented a 7 decrease in yearoveryear sales the effect of exchange rates can vary by business and region depending upon the mix of sales by country as well as the relative percentage of local sales priced in us dollars versus local currencies currency neutral sales growth including acquisitions was 5  in 2015  we saw good currency neutral sales growth during each quarter of 2015  despite the impact of volume erosion on existing business we believe that market conditions and the macroeconomic environment will continue to be challenging in many markets in 2016 this lower growth environment combined with a stronger us dollar and the reset of the incentive compensation program is expected to pressure our currency neutral operating profit growth and consequently we expect currency neutral operating profit growth in 2016 to be mid singledigits including acquisitions 

  33 

on a longterm basis we expect that sales growth for the industry will generally be in line with the underlying assumptions that support our longterm strategic goals albeit with some risk in the near term given the continuing global economic uncertainty we believe changing social habits resulting from increased disposable income improved focus on personal health and wellness awareness should help drive growth of our consumer product customers’ businesses 

gross margin increased 60  basis points bps yearoveryear included in 2015 was 79 million of acquisitionrelated inventory stepup costs and costs associated with operational improvement initiatives compared to 76 million of costs related to accelerated depreciation included in cost of goods sold and operational improvement initiatives included in 2014 excluding these items gross margin increased 60 bps compared to the prior year period the increase was principally driven by productivity initiatives we ended 2015 in a relatively benign raw material cost environment we believe that we will continue to see higher prices on certain categories such as naturals including citrus and vanilla that will be offset by benefits associated with oilbased derivatives that are expected to continue in 2016 we continue to seek improvements in our margins through operational performance cost reduction efforts and mix enhancement 

operating profit decreased 40 million  to 5883 million   195  of sales in 2015  compared to 5923 million   192  of sales in 2014  included in 2015  were acquisition related costs of 183 million  the reversal of the previously recorded provision for the spanish capital tax case of 105 million accelerated contingent consideration payments of 72 million  restructuring and other charges net of 76 million  and operational improvement initiative costs of 11 million  compared to operational improvement initiative costs of 25 million restructuring and other charges net of 13 million and 51 million of accelerated depreciation in 2014  excluding these charges adjusted operating profit was 6121 million  202  of sales for 2015  versus 6013 million 195 of sales for 2014  foreign currency changes had an unfavorable impact on operating profit of approximately 6 in 2015 

cash flows from operations were 4336 million  or 143  of sales in 2015  as compared to cash flows from operations of 5184 million  or 168  of sales during 2014  the decrease in operating cash flows in 2015 as compared to 2014 is principally related to the impact of higher pension contributions increased core working capital requirements trade receivables inventories and accounts payable and increased requirements related to various operating items including taxes employee benefits and prepaids 

our capital spend was 1010 million   33  of sales during 2015  given our intent to construct a new flavors facility in china the continuation of our indonesia project and carryover payments from 2015 we expect that capital spending in 2016 will be approximately 5 of sales net of potential grants and other reimbursements from government authorities

2015   in comparison to   2014   

sales 

sales for 2015  totaled 30 billion  a decrease of 2  from the prior year excluding currency impacts sales increased 5  the currency neutral growth reflects new win performance net of losses in both flavors and fragrance compounds partially offset by volume erosion on existing business principally driven by our customers product line rationalization and inventory management efforts in addition our flavors business was negatively impacted by volume erosion in north america noam as well as weak demand and lost business in china principally associated with facility issues on both a reported and currency neutral basis the effect of acquisitions was approximately 2  to net sales amounts in addition fragrance ingredients sales 

  35 

were up 2  on a currency neutral basis overall organic currency neutral growth includes 5 growth from emerging markets and 1 from developed markets 

flavors business unit 

flavors sales in 2015  decreased 1  on a reported basis but increased 6  on a currency neutral basis versus the prior year period acquisitions accounted for approximately half of the net sales growth on a currency neutral basis overall growth was primarily due to mid singledigit growth in beverage combined with high singledigit growth in dairy and low singledigit growth in savory regionally the flavors business delivered currency neutral growth across all regions led by la at 16  driven by doubledigit gains in beverage savory and dairy sales growth in ga of 2  was led by low singledigit gains in savory and dairy which more than offset low singledigit declines in sweet sales growth in eame of 4  was driven by mid singledigit gains in savory and beverage noam sales growth of 11  was primarily driven by high doubledigit growth in sweet and dairy and doubledigit growth in beverage eame performance continues to be led by our performance in the emerging market countries within the region globally flavors growth was led by mid singledigit growth in emerging markets overall emerging markets represented approximately 52 of total flavors sales 

fragrances business unit

 cost of goods sold 

cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales decreased 60  bps on a reported and adjusted basis to 553  in 2015  compared to 559  in 2014  or 550 and 556 on an adjusted basis in 2015  and 2014  respectively included in cost of goods sold was 79 million of acquisition related costs including 68 million of inventory stepup costs and operational improvement initiative costs in 2015  and 76 million of charges related to restructuring and operational improvement initiative costs in 2014  

research and development rd 

rd expenses as a percentage of sales decreased slightly from the prior year period at 81  in 2015  compared to 82  in 2014  the decrease was principally driven by lower incentive compensation expense in 2015 

selling and administrative sa 

sa as a percentage of sales increased 20  bps to 169  versus 167  the increase in sa expenses was principally due to acquisitionrelated expenses which were partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense and the reversal of the previously recorded provision related to the spanish capital tax case of 105 million 

restructuring and other charges 

restructuring and other charges primarily consist of separation costs for employees including severance outplacement and other benefit costs   



2015 severance and contingent consideration charges 

during the fourth quarter of 2015 we established a series of initiatives that are expected to streamline our management structure simplify decisionmaking and accountability better leverage and align our capabilities across the organization and improve efficiency of our global manufacturing and operations network as a result we recorded a pretax charge of 76 million  included in restructuring and other charges net related to severance and related costs pertaining to approximately 150 positions that will be affected the total cost of the plan is expected to be approximately 10 million with the remaining charges relating principally to accelerated depreciation the company expects to realize pretax savings of approximately 79 million once fully implemented in the second half of 2017 half of which is expected to be realized in 2016 

separately we recorded a charge of 72 million  included in selling and administrative expenses associated with the acceleration from 2016 to 2015 of contingent consideration payments from the aromor acquisition that were triggered by certain of the management structure changes noted above 

fragrance ingredients rationalization  2014

fragrances business unit 

fragrances segment profit decreased 137 million  to 3218 million  in 2015   204  of sales compared to 3354 million   206  of sales reported in 2014  the decrease in segment profit and profit margin was principally driven by unfavorable foreign currency impacts which were partially offset by favorable volume growth sales mix and a slight impact from the addition of lucas meyer

other expense income net 

other expense income net decreased approximately 60 million  to 32 million  of expense in 2015  versus 28 million  of income in 2014  this decrease is primarily driven by lower foreign exchange gains on working capital and lower marktomarket adjustments on deferred compensation plan assets during 2015 compared to the 2014 period

2014  in comparison to 2013   

sales 

sales for 2014 totaled 31 billion an increase of 5 from the prior year on both a reported and currency neutral basis with the acquisition of aromor adding approximately 1 to both reported and currency neutral basis amounts the currency neutral growth reflected new win performance net of losses in both flavors and fragrance compounds partially offset by volume erosion on existing business in addition fragrance ingredients sales were up 18 which includes the benefit of the aromor acquisition overall currency neutral growth was driven by 6 growth in emerging markets 

flavors business unit 

in 2014 flavors sales increased 2 on a reported basis and 4 on a currency neutral basis versus 2013 the overall performance reflects new wins offset by volume erosion on existing business overall high singledigit growth in beverage combined with low singledigit growth in savory and mid singledigit growth in dairy was partially offset by low singledigit declines in sweet regionally the flavors business delivered currency neutral growth in la eame and ga led by la while sales declined in noam sales in la were driven by high doubledigit gains in beverage sales in ga were led by mid singledigit gains in savory and sales in eame were driven by doubledigit gains in beverage the declines in noam were primarily driven by low singledigit declines in beverage and sweet which were only partially offset by doubledigit gains in dairy eame performance continues to be led by our performance in the emerging market countries within the region globally flavors growth was led by high singledigit growth in emerging markets overall emerging markets represented approximately 52 of total flavors sales 

fragrances business unit 

in 2014 the fragrances business was up 7 in both reported and currency neutral terms versus 2013 yearoveryear 2014 currency neutral sales performance was led by doubledigit growth in fragrance ingredients high singledigit growth in fabric care and mid singledigit growth in hair care categories as well as low singledigit growth in fine fragrances currency neutral growth within the regions was led by ga at 11 reflecting doubledigit gains in the fabric care and fragrance ingredients eame experienced currency neutral sales growth of 8 reflecting doubledigit gains in fragrance ingredients and high singledigit gains in fabric care la had currency neutral sales growth of 3 reflecting doubledigit gains in hair care and personal wash noam currency neutral sales increased 4 reflecting doubledigit gains in home care and mid to high singledigit gains in fabric care and hair care categories that more than offset low singledigit declines in fragrance ingredients overall emerging markets represented 47 of total fragrances sales 

sales performance by region and category   



 

   39 

were up 8 versus last year as new wins and volume gains in home care and fabric care were only partially offset by lower volumes on existing business in fragrance ingredients 

 cost of goods sold 

cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales decreased 60 bps on both a reported and adjusted basis to 559 in 2014 compared to 565 in 2013 or 556 and 562 on an adjusted basis in 2014 and 2013 respectively included in cost of goods sold was 76 million of charges related to restructuring and operational improvement initiative costs in 2014 and 88 million of restructuring and operational improvement initiative costs in 2013 

research and development rd 

rd expenses decreased approximately 62 million versus the prior year overall rd expenses decreased 60 bps as a percentage of sales from 88 in 2013 to 82 in 2014 this decrease is primarily driven by lower incentive compensation expense

operating results by business unit 

we evaluate the performance of business units based on segment profit which is defined as operating profit before restructuring and certain nonrecurring items interest expense other expense net and taxes on income see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for the reconciliation to income before taxes   



flavors business unit 

flavors segment profit totaled 3313 million in 2014 227 of sales consistent with 3236 million 227 of sales in the comparable 2013 period the increase in segment profit was driven by lower incentive compensation expense 

fragrances business unit 

fragrances segment profit totaled 3354 million in 2014 206 of sales compared to 2837 million 185 of sales reported in 2013 the improvement in segment profit and profit margin was primarily due to strong sales growth combined with gross margin expansion ongoing cost discipline and lower incentive compensation expense 

global expenses 

global expenses represent corporate and headquarterrelated expenses which include legal finance human resources and rd and other administrative expenses that are not allocated to an individual business unit in 2014 global expenses were 654 million compared to 669 million during 2013 the decrease is principally driven by lower incentive compensation expense 

interest expense 

in 2014 interest expense decreased 07 million to 461 million as a result of the refinancing of our debt in 2013 average cost of debt was 49 for the 2014 period compared to 47 in 2013 

other income expense net 

other income expense net decreased approximately 128 million to 28 million of income in 2014 versus 156 million of income in 2013 the decrease was largely driven by a 142 million gain related to the sale of nonoperating assets that occurred during 2013 

income taxes 

the effective tax rate was 245 in 2014 as compared to 271 in 2013 excluding the 26 million tax benefit associated with the pretax restructuring charges and operational improvement initiative costs as well as the 38 million tax benefit related to the reserve reversal for the 2001 spanish dividend withholding tax case as discussed in note 10 of the consolidated financial statements the adjusted tax rate for 2014 was 253 excluding the tax charge of 62 million related to the 20022003 income tax cases as discussed in note 10 of the consolidated financial statements and net of the 39 million tax benefit associated with the pretax spanish capital tax charge as discussed in note 18 of the consolidated financial statements the adjusted tax rate for 2013 was 257 the yearoveryear reduction reflects a benefit from mix of earnings and lower loss provisions partially offset by a higher cost of repatriation 

  41 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash and cash equivalents 

we had cash and cash equivalents of 1820 million  at december 31 2015  compared to 4786 million  at december 31 2014  of which 1301 million of the balance at december 31 2015  was held outside the united states cash balances held in foreign jurisdictions are in most circumstances available to be repatriated to the united states however they would be subject to united states federal income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits we have not provided us income tax expense on substantially all of the accumulated undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries because we have the ability and plan to reinvest these indefinitely 

effective utilization of the cash generated by our international operations is a critical component of our tax strategy strategic dividend repatriation from foreign subsidiaries creates us taxable income which enables us to realize us deferred tax assets we regularly repatriate in the form of dividends from our nonus subsidiaries a portion of our current year earnings to fund financial obligations in the us these repatriations of current year earnings totaled 1846 million 2480 million and 1280 million in 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively 

cash flows from operating activities 

operating cash flows in 2015  were 4336 million  compared to 5184 million  in 2014  and 4076 million  in 2013  the decrease in operating cash flows in 2015 as compared to 2014 is principally related to the impact of higher pension contributions increased core working capital requirements and increased requirements related to various operating items including taxes employee benefits and prepaids included in 2014 was payment of 112 million to the spanish government related to a capital tax case and included in 2013 was 48 million of cash payments related to the spanish tax cases 

working capital current assets less current liabilities totaled 7138 million  at yearend 2015  compared to 11912 million  at december 31 2014  this decrease in working capital of 4774 million  primarily reflects a decrease in cash balances principally resulting from the acquisitions of ottens flavors and lucas meyer during 2015 as well as higher payable balances we sold certain accounts receivable on a nonrecourse basis to unrelated financial institutions under “factoring” agreements that are sponsored solely and individually by certain customers we believe that participating in the factoring programs strengthens our relationships with these customers and provides operational efficiencies we estimate that as a result of participating in the programs there was a beneficial impact to cash inflows from operations of approximately 34 million 331 million and 65 million in 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively the cost of participating in these programs was immaterial to our results in all periods 

cash flows used in investing activities 

net investing activities in 2015  utilized 5772 million  compared to 2213 million  and 1054 million  in 2014  and 2013  respectively the increase in cash paid for investing activities is primarily driven by the acquisitions of ottens flavors and lucas meyer during 2015 we acquired 100  of the outstanding shares of ottens flavors and lucas meyer for approximately 1885 million  net of cash acquired and 3049 million  net of cash acquired respectively 

additions to property plant and equipment were 1010 million  1432 million  and 1342 million  in 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively net of grants and other reimbursements from government authorities these investments largely arise from our ongoing focus to align our manufacturing facilities with our customer demand primarily in emerging markets and new technology consistent with our strategy but also reflect approximately 65 million in odorabatement equipment which was invested to address environmental issues at one of our flavors facilities in china 

in light of our intent to construct a new flavors facility in china our relocation of our ingredients facility in hangzhou china and the continuation of our indonesia project we expect that capital spending in 2016 will be approximately 5 of sales net of potential grants and other reimbursements from government authorities 

cash flows used in provided by financing activities 

net financing activities in 2015  had an outflow of 1313 million  compared to an outflow of 2023 million  and an outflow of 2170 million  in 2014  and 2013  respectively the decrease in outflow of cash used in financing activities in 2015  as compared to 2014  principally reflects higher incremental dividend payments and treasury share repurchases in 2015 which were more than offset by proceeds from the drawdown on the revolving credit facility during 2015 the decrease in outflow of cash used in financing activities in 2014 compared to 2013 principally reflects higher incremental dividend payments and treasury share repurchases in 2014 which were more than offset by the repayment of longterm debt of 100 million made in 2013 

  42 

at december 31 2015  we had 10702 million  of debt outstanding compared to 9423 million  outstanding at december 31 2014  

we paid dividends totaling 1589 million  1332 million  and 873 million  in 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively the cash dividend declared per share in 2015  2014  and 2013  was 206  172 and 146 respectively 

in december 2012 the board of directors authorized a 250 million share repurchase program which commenced in the first quarter of 2013 in august 2015 the board of directors approved an additional 250 million share repurchase authorization and extension through december 31 2017 based on the total remaining amount of 237 million  available under the repurchase program approximately 20 million  shares or 25  of shares outstanding based on the market price and shares outstanding as of december 31 2015  could be repurchased under the program as of december 31 2015  the purchases will be made from time to time on the open market or through private transactions as market and business conditions warrant repurchased shares will be placed into treasury stock the ultimate level of purchases will be a function of the daily purchase limits established in the preapproved program according to the share price at that time 

capital resources 

operating cash flow provides the primary source of funds for capital investment needs dividends paid to shareholders and debt repayments we anticipate that cash flows from operations and availability under our existing credit facilities are sufficient to meet our investing and financing needs for at least the next eighteen months we regularly assess our capital structure including both current and longterm debt instruments as compared to our cash generation and investment needs in order to provide ample flexibility and to optimize our leverage ratios based on our leverage ratios and general market interest rate expectations we anticipate evaluating refinancing opportunities during 2016 we believe our existing cash balances are sufficient to meet our debt service requirements 

during the third quarter of 2015 we acquired lucas meyer for approximately 3049 million  net of cash acquired which was funded from existing resources 

during the second quarter of 2015 we acquired ottens flavors for approximately 1885 million  net of cash acquired which was funded from existing resources 

credit facility and senior notes 

we supplement shortterm liquidity with access to capital markets mainly through bank credit facilities and issuance of commercial paper we did not issue commercial paper during 2015  and 2014  

credit facility 

there are two tranches under the credit facility the tranche a facility is available in us dollars euros swiss francs japanese yen and british sterling in an aggregate amount up to an equivalent of 4560 million with a sublimit of 250 million for swing line borrowings the tranche b facility is available in euros swiss francs japanese yen and british sterling in an aggregate amount up to an equivalent of 4940 million the credit facility is available for general corporate purposes borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at an annual rate of libor plus a margin currently 1125 bps linked to our credit rating the interest rate under our credit facility at december 31 2015 was 113  the credit facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants including the requirement for us to maintain at the end of each fiscal quarter a ratio of net debt for borrowed money to adjusted ebitda in respect of the previous 12month period of not more than 325 to 1 based on this ratio at december 31 2015  our covenant compliance would provide overall borrowing capacity of 14293 million  

as of december 31 2015  we had  1312 million  borrowings under the credit facility the amount which we are able to draw down on under the credit facility is limited by financial covenants as described in more detail below our drawdown capacity on the credit facility was 7907 million  at december 31 2015  see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the credit facility 

at december 31 2015  and 2014  we were in compliance with all financial and other covenants including the net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio at december 31 2015  our net debtadjusted ebitda 1 ratio was 124  to 1 as defined by the credit facility well below the financial covenants of existing outstanding debt failure to comply with the financial and other covenants under our debt agreements would constitute default and would allow the lenders to accelerate the maturity of all indebtedness under the related agreement if such acceleration were to occur we would not have sufficient liquidity available to repay the indebtedness we would likely have to seek amendments under the agreements for relief from the financial covenants or repay the debt with proceeds from the issuance of new debt or equity andor asset sales if necessary we may be unable to amend the agreements or raise sufficient capital to repay such obligations in the event the maturities are accelerated

senior notes 

senior notes  2013 in april 2013 we issued 3000 million face amount of 320 senior notes “senior notes  2013” due 2023 at a discount of 03 million to take advantage of attractive borrowing rates and maintain efficiency and flexibility in our capital structure and received proceeds of 2978 million the senior notes 2013 bear interest at a rate of 320 per year with interest payable on may 1 and november 1 of each year commencing on november 1 2013 see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the senior notes  2013

other commitments 

compliance with existing governmental requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment has not materially affected our operations earnings or competitive position in 2015  and 2014  we spent 93 million and 43 million on capital projects and 190 million and 192 million respectively in operating expenses and governmental charges for the purpose of complying with such regulations expenditures for these purposes will continue for the foreseeable future in addition we are party to a number of proceedings brought under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act or similar state statutes it is expected that the impact of any judgments in or voluntary settlements of such proceedings will not be material to our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

  44 

contractual obligations 

at december 31 2015  we had contractual payment obligations due within the time periods as specified in the following table   



 

 the table above does not include 242 million of the total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions and approximately 08 million of associated accrued interest due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential cash flows we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the amount and period in which the remaining liabilities might be paid 

critical accounting policies and use of estimates 

our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements as disclosed in note 1 the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and accompanying disclosures these estimates are based on management’s best judgment of current events and actions that we may undertake in the future actual results may ultimately differ from estimates 

those areas requiring the greatest degree of management judgment or deemed most critical to our financial reporting involve 

the periodic assessment of potential impairment of goodwill  we currently have goodwill of 9414 million  in assessing the potential for impairment of goodwill management uses the most current actual and forecasted operating data available and current market based assumptions in accordance with the criteria in asc 350 the company has identified four reporting units 1 flavors 2 fragrance compounds 3 fragrance ingredients and 4 cosmetic active ingredients 

the company performed the annual goodwill impairment test utilizing the twostep approach for the flavors fragrance compounds and fragrance ingredients reporting units by assessing the fair value of our reporting units based on discounted cash flows we completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of november 30 2015 which indicated no impairment of goodwill as the estimated fair values substantially exceeded the carrying values of each of these reporting units given the recent date of the acquisition of lucas meyer we utilized the qualitative approach for the cosmetic active ingredients reporting unit which indicated no impairment of goodwill 

the analysis and evaluation of income taxes  we account for taxes under the asset and liability method under this method deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax return bases of assets and liabilities a valuation allowance is recognized if based on the weight of available evidence it is more likely than 

  45 

not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized the assessment of the need for a valuation allowance requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future earnings reversal of existing temporary differences and available tax planning strategies if actual experience differs from these estimates and assumptions the recorded deferred tax asset may not be fully realized resulting in an increase to income tax expense in our results of operations 

the company has not established deferred tax liabilities for substantially all undistributed foreign earnings as it has plans to and intends to indefinitely reinvest those earnings to finance foreign activities the unrecognized deferred tax liability on these undistributed earnings approximates 2336 million  

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes we first determine whether it is “more likely than not” that we would sustain our tax position if the relevant tax authority were to audit the position with full knowledge of all the relevant facts and other information for those tax positions that meet this threshold we measure the amount of tax benefit based on the largest amount of tax benefit that we have a greater than 50 chance of realizing in a final settlement with the relevant authority those tax positions failing to qualify for initial recognition are recognized in the first interim period in which they meet the more likely than not standard this evaluation is made at the time that we adopt a tax position and whenever there is new information and is based upon management’s evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date we maintain a cumulative risk portfolio relating to all of our uncertainties in income taxes in order to perform this analysis but the evaluation of our tax positions requires significant judgment and estimation in part because in certain cases tax law is subject to varied interpretation and whether a tax position will ultimately be sustained may be uncertain we do not currently believe that any of our pending tax assessments even if ultimately resolved against us would have a material impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

the evaluation of potential litigation and environmental liabilities where changing circumstances rules and regulations require regular reassessment of related practices and anticipated costs  we are subject to certain legal claims regarding products and other matters as well as environmentalrelated matters significant management judgment is involved in determining when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the extent to which it can be reasonably estimated 

we regularly assess potential liabilities with respect to all legal claims based on the most recent available information in consultation with outside counsel we have engaged on our behalf to handle the defense of such matters to the extent a liability is considered to be probable and reasonably estimable we recognize a corresponding liability if the reasonably estimated liability is a range we recognize that amount considered most likely or in the absence of such a determination the minimum reasonably estimated liability to the extent such claims are covered by various insurance policies we separately evaluate the right to recovery and estimate the related insurance claim receivable management judgments involve determination as to whether a liability has been incurred the reasonably estimated amount of that liability and any potential insurance recovery 

we regularly evaluate potential environmental exposure in terms of total estimated cost and the viability of other potentially responsible parties “prp’s” associated with our exposure recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress and additional information becomes available critical management assumptions relate to expected total costs to remediate and the financial viability of prp’s to share such costs 

determination of the various assumptions employed in the valuation of pension and retiree health care expense and associated obligations  amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined from actuarial valuations inherent in such valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets discount rates at which the liabilities could be settled rates of increase in future compensation levels mortality rates and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore affect expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods 

we consider a number of factors in determining and selecting assumptions for the overall expected longterm rate of return on plan assets we consider the historical longterm return experience of our assets the current and expected allocation of our plan assets and expected longterm rates of return we derive these expected longterm rates of return with the assistance of our investment advisors we base our expected allocation of plan assets on a diversified portfolio consisting of domestic and international equity securities fixed income real estate and alternative asset classes 

we consider a variety of factors in determining and selecting our assumptions for the discount rate at december 31 for the us plans the discount rate was based on the internal rate of return for a portfolio of moody’s aaa aa and merrill lynch aaaaa high quality bonds with maturities that are consistent with the projected future benefit payment obligations of the plan the rate of compensation increase for all plans and the medical cost trend rate for the applicable us plans are based on plan experience 

with respect to the us plans the expected rate of return on plan assets was determined based on an asset allocation model using the current target allocation real rates of return by asset class and an anticipated inflation rate the target asset 

  46 

allocation consists of approximately 40  in equity securities and 60  in fixed income securities the plan has achieved a compounded annual rate of return of 69 over the previous 20 years at december 31 2015  the actual asset allocation was 41  in equity securities 58  in fixed income securities and 1  in cash equivalents 

the expected rate of return for the nonus plans employs a similar set of criteria adapted for local investments inflation rates and in certain cases specific government requirements the target asset allocation for the nonus plans consists of approximately 40  – 70  in fixed income securities 15  – 40  in equity securities 5  – 20  in real estate and 5  – 10  in alternative investments at december 31 2015  the actual asset allocation was 55  in fixed income investments 27  in equity investments 7  in real estate investments 9  in alternative investments and 2  in cash and cash equivalents 

changes in pension and other postemployment benefits and associated expenses may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions the impact that a 025 decrease in the discount rate or a 1 change in the medical cost trend rate would have on our pension and other postemployment benefit expense as applicable is as follows 



the effect of a 1 increase in the medical cost trend rate would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and the annual postretirement expense by approximately 06 million  and 01 million  respectively a 1 decrease in the rate would decrease the obligation and expense by approximately 06 million  and 01 million  respectively 

the ongoing assessment of the valuation of inventory given the large number of natural ingredients employed the quality of which may be diminished over time  we hold a majority of our inventory as raw materials providing the greatest degree of flexibility in manufacture and use as of december 31 2015  we maintained 48  of our inventory as raw materials materials are evaluated based on shelf life known uses and anticipated demand based on forecasted customer order activity and changes in productsales mix management policy provides for an ongoing assessment of inventory with adjustments recorded when an item is deemed to be slow moving or obsolete 

we believe that we have considered relevant circumstances that we may be currently subject to and the financial statements accurately reflect our best estimate of the impact of these items in our results of operations financial condition and cash flows for the years presented we have discussed the decision process and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 

new accounting standards 

in february 2016 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued authoritative guidance which requires changes to the accounting for leases the new guidance establishes a new lease accounting model that for many companies eliminates the concept of operating leases and requires entities to record assets and liabilities related to leases on the balance sheet for certain types of leases the guidance will be effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december 31 2018 early adoption will be permitted for all entities the company is currently evaluating the impact that this new standard will have on its consolidated financial statements

nongaap financial measures 

the company uses nongaap financial operating measures in this annual report including i currency neutral sales which eliminates the effects that result from translating its international sales in us dollars ii adjusted operating profit and operating profit margin which excludes the acquisition related costs reversal of the previously recorded provision for the spanish capital tax case operational improvement initiative and restructuring charges and iii adjusted effective tax rate which excludes the sale of a nonoperating assets tax and litigation settlements restructuring charges acquisition related costs reversal of the previously recorded provision for the spanish capital tax case and operational improvement initiative costs the company also provides the nongaap measures adjusted ebitda which excludes certain specified items and noncash items as set forth in the company’s debt agreements and net debt which is adjusted for deferred gain on interest rate swaps and cash and cash equivalents solely for the purpose of providing information regarding the companys compliance with debt covenants contained in its debt agreements 

we have included each of these nongaap measures in order to provide additional information regarding our underlying operating results and comparable yearoveryear performance such information is supplemental to information presented in accordance with gaap and is not intended to represent a presentation in accordance with gaap in discussing our historical and expected future results and financial condition we believe it is meaningful for investors to be made aware of and to be assisted in a better understanding of on a periodtoperiod comparable basis financial amounts both including and excluding these identified items as well as the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on operating results and financial condition we believe such additional nongaap information provides investors with an overall perspective of the periodtoperiod performance of our business in addition management internally reviews each of these nongaap measures to evaluate performance on a comparative periodtoperiod basis in terms of absolute performance trends and expected future performance with respect to our business a material limitation of these nongaap measures is that such measures do not reflect actual gaap amounts for example costs associated with operational improvements and restructuring activities involve actual cash outlays we compensate for such limitations by using these measures as one of several metrics including gaap measures these nongaap measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we operate on a global basis and are exposed to currency fluctuation related to the manufacture and sale of our products in currencies other than the us dollar the major foreign currencies involve the markets in the european union great britain mexico brazil china india indonesia australia and japan although all regions are subject to foreign currency fluctuations versus the us dollar we actively monitor our foreign currency exposures in all major markets in which we operate and employ a variety of techniques to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations including foreign currency hedging activities 

we have established a centralized reporting system to evaluate the effects of changes in interest rates currency exchange rates and other relevant market risks our risk management procedures include the monitoring of interest rate and foreign exchange exposures and hedge positions utilizing statistical analyses of cash flows market value and sensitivity analysis however the use of these techniques to quantify the market risk of such instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of their accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions for the year ended december 31 2015  the company’s exposure to market risk was estimated using sensitivity analyses which illustrate the change in the fair value of a derivative financial instrument assuming hypothetical changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts with the objective of reducing exposure to cash flow volatility associated with foreign currency receivables and payables and with anticipated purchases of certain raw materials used in operations these contracts the counterparties to which are major international financial institutions generally involve the exchange of one currency for a second currency at a future date and have maturities not exceeding twelve months the gain or loss on the hedging instrument and services is recorded in earnings at the same time as the transaction being hedged is recorded in earnings at december 31 2015  the company’s foreign currency exposures pertaining to derivative contracts exist with the euro japanese yen south african rand british pound canadian dollar and australian dollar based on a hypothetical decrease or increase of 10 in the applicable balance sheet exchange rates primarily against the us dollar the estimated fair value of the company’s foreign currency forward contracts would increase or decrease by approximately 36 million however any change in the value of the contracts real or hypothetical would be significantly offset by a corresponding change in the value of the underlying hedged items 

we have also used nonus dollar borrowings and foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the foreign currency exposures of our net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries primarily in the european union based on a hypothetical decrease or increase of 10 in the value of the us dollar against the euro the estimated fair value of the company’s foreign currency forward contracts would change by approximately 10 million however any change in the value of the contracts real or hypothetical would be significantly offset by a corresponding change in the value of the underlying hedged items 

we use derivative instruments as part of our interest rate risk management strategy the derivative instruments used are comprised principally of fixed to variable rate interest rate swaps based on the libor plus an interest mark up the notional amount interest payment and maturity date of the swaps match the principal interest payment and maturity date of the related debt and the swaps are valued using observable benchmark rates based on a hypothetical decrease or increase of one percentage point in libor the estimated fair value of the company’s interest rate swaps would change by less than 8 million 

at december 31 2015  the fair value of our fixed rate debt was 982 million based on a hypothetical decrease of 10 in interest rates the estimated fair value of the company’s fixed debt would increase by 7 million 

we purchase certain commodities such as natural gas electricity petroleum based products and certain crop related items we generally purchase these commodities based upon market prices that are established with the vendor as part of the purchase process in general we do not use commodity financial instruments to hedge commodity prices

we have a strong commitment to emerging markets we believe that significant future growth potential for the flavors and fragrances industry and for our business exists in the emerging markets all markets except north america japan australia and western southern and northern europe over the past five years our local currency growth rate in emerging markets has significantly outpaced that of developed markets we expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future the emerging market local currency growth rate in 2014 was 6 we have had operations in some of the largest emerging markets for multiple decades as a result of these established operations sales in emerging markets represented 50 of 2014 sales up from 49 in 2013 as our customers in emerging markets grow their businesses they will have the ability to leverage our longstanding presence and our extensive market knowledge to help drive their brands

strategic priorities 

we are focused on generating sustainable profitable growth across our business we believe that we can continue to deliver returns above cost of capital on a longterm basis and increase shareholder value by leveraging our geographic reach strengthening our innovation platform and maximizing our portfolio we are in the process of refreshing the key elements of our strategic priorities which are the following 

 our product offerings 

flavors 

flavors are the key building blocks that impart taste in processed food and beverage products and as such play a significant role in determining consumer preference of the end products in which they are used while we are a global leader our flavors business is regional in nature with different formulas that reflect local taste and ingredients as a leading creator of flavor compounds we help our customers deliver on the promise of delicious and healthy foods and drinks that appeal to consumers our flavors compounds are ultimately used by our customers in four enduse categories 1 savory 2 beverages 3 sweet pharmaceutical and oral care “sweet” and 4 dairy we create our flavors in our regional creative and technical centers that allow us to satisfy local taste preferences while also helping to ensure regulatory compliance and production standards we also manufacture a limited amount of flavor ingredients for our use in developing flavor compounds 

 

 

 

 

we develop thousands of different flavors and taste offerings for our customers most of which are tailormade we continuously develop new formulas in order to meet changing consumer preferences and customer needs consumers especially those in developed markets such as the united states and western europe are increasingly seeking to focus on products which promote health and wellness they want food and beverage products that are both good for them and taste good our objective is to capture a significant share of this shift in consumer demand by capitalizing on the ability of our naturals and proprietary ingredients and flavor systems technologies to provide consumers with healthier solutions without changing the taste experience of the food or beverage 

fragrances 

we are a global leader in the creation of fragrances our fragrances are a key component in the world’s finest perfumes and bestknown consumer brands including fabric care home care personal wash hair care and toiletries our fragrances business consists of fragrance compounds and fragrance ingredients 

 

we believe that our inhouse naturals operations led by laboratoire monique rémy “lmr” in grasse france are industry leading in the processing quality materials and offer decades of experience understanding natural products and perfecting the process of transforming naturals such as narcissus jasmine and blackcurrant bud into pure absolutes that retain the unique fragrance of their origin 

our perfumers have access to our large portfolio of innovative highquality and costeffective ingredients to support their creativity which in turn provides our customers with a unique identity for their brands we also create innovative delivery systems including i our proprietary encapsulation technology which consists of individual fragrance droplets coated with a protective polymetric shell to deliver superior fragrance performance throughout a product’s lifecycle and ii our exclusive polymer delivery system polyiff which is a “solid fragrance” technology that allows us to add scent to functional or molded plastic 

we also collaborate with some of the world’s leading art and fashion schools to tap into the creative minds of the future leaders of fashion and design we collaborate with scientists writers artists musicians and filmmakers to expose our perfumers to new and constantly evolving creative territories and approaches 

core competencies 

we focus on five core competencies that we believe enable us to i successfully provide our customers with superior products ii drive productivity and efficiency gains and iii improve our margins and our cash flow in that regard we strive to 

 

 

 

 

 research and product development 

we consider our rd development infrastructure to be one of our key competencies and we focus and invest substantial resources in the research and development of new and innovative compounds formulas and technologies and the application of these to our customers’ products using the knowledge gained from our consumer insights program we strategically focus our resources around key rd platforms that address consumer needs or preferences or anticipate a future preference by aligning our resources around these platforms we ensure the proper support and focus for each program so that it can be further developed and eventually be accepted for commercial application 

we maintain six rd centers around the world where we employ scientists and application engineers to support i the discovery of new materials ii the development of new technologies such as our delivery systems iii the creation of new compounds and iv the enhancement of existing ingredients and compounds in our 31 creative centers around the world including our newest facilities in shanghai sao paulo moscow singapore mumbai delhi chengdu and beijing teams of flavorists and perfumers work with our customers’ product development groups to create the exact scent or taste they are seeking in 2014 we employed about 1250 people in research and product development activities we spent 254 million 260 million and 234 million or approximately 8 9 and 8 of sales in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively on rd activities 

our ingredients research program discovers molecules found in natural substances and creates new molecules that are subsequently tested for their fragrance or flavor value to broaden our offering of natural innovative and unique products we seek collaborations with research institutions and other companies throughout the world we have created a number of such collaborations for example our ongoing relationship with amyris which strengthens and broadens the pipeline of new and innovative molecules that we intend to launch in the coming years to further strengthen and broaden our technology offerings and capabilities we acquired aromor in january 2014 to provide us with costeffective complex specialty ingredients 

the development of new and customized flavor and fragrance compounds is a complex process calling upon the combined knowledge of our scientists flavorists and perfumers scientists from various disciplines work in project teams with the flavorists and perfumers to develop flavor and fragrance compounds with consumer preferred performance characteristics the development of new flavor and fragrance compounds requires i indepth knowledge of the flavor and fragrance characteristics of the various ingredients we use ii an understanding of how the many ingredients in a consumer product interact and iii the creation of controlled release and delivery systems to enhance flavor and fragrance performance to facilitate this process we have a scientific advisory board comprised of five leading scientists that provide external perspectives and independent feedback on our rd initiatives 

development of new flavors and fragrances is driven by a variety of sources including requests from our customers who are in need of a specific flavor or fragrance for use in a new or modified consumer product or as a result of internal initiatives stemming from our consumer insights program our product development team works in partnership with our scientists and researchers to optimize the consumer appeal of the flavor or fragrance a collaborative process between our researchers our product development team and our customers then follows to perfect the flavor or fragrance so that it is ready to be included in the final consumer product 

in addition to creating new flavors and fragrances our researchers and product development teams advise customers on ways to improve their existing products by adjusting or substituting current ingredients with more readily accessible or less expensive materials or by modifying the current ingredients to produce an enhanced yield this often results in creating a better value proposition for our customers 

our flavor and fragrance formulas are treated as trade secrets and remain our proprietary asset our business is not materially dependent upon any individual patent trademark or license 

supply chain 

we have an integrated supply chain from raw material sourcing through manufacturing quality assurance regulatory compliance and distribution which permits us to provide our customers with consistent quality products on a timely and costeffective basis 

procurement  the ingredients that we use in our compounds are both natural and synthetic we purchase approximately 8500 different raw materials from about 2300 domestic and international suppliers approximately half of the materials we purchase are naturals or crop related items and the other half are synthetics and chemicals natural ingredients are derived from flowers fruits and other botanical products as well as from animal products they contain varying numbers of organic chemicals that are responsible for the fragrance or flavor of the natural product the natural products are purchased in processed or semiprocessed form some are used in compounds in the state in which they are purchased and others after further processing natural products together with various chemicals are also used as raw materials for the manufacture of synthetic ingredients by chemical processes our flavor products also include extracts and seasonings derived from various fruits vegetables nuts herbs and spices as well as microbiologicallyderived ingredients we manufacture most of our synthetic ingredients for use in our fragrance compounds as well as for sale to others 

while we purchase a diverse portfolio of raw materials about 80 of our spending is focused on approximately 800 materials which allows us to leverage our buying power with suppliers in order to ensure our supply of raw materials achieve favorable pricing and provide timely transparency regarding inflationary trends to our customers we continue to be focused on i implementing a forwardbuy strategy ii entering into supplier relationships to gain access to supplies that we do not have iii implementing indexed pricing iv reducing the complexity of our formulations and v evaluating whether it is more profitable to buy or make an ingredient we are also concentrating on local country sourcing with our own procurement professionals 

manufacturing and distribution  we have 29 manufacturing sites around the world that support more than 36000 products our major manufacturing facilities are located in the united states the netherlands spain great britain turkey brazil mexico australia china india and singapore our supply chain initiatives in developing markets are focused on 

increasing capacity and investments in key technologies while within our more mature markets we tend to focus on consolidation and cost optimization as well as implementing new technologies in addition to our own manufacturing facilities we develop relationships with third parties that permit us to expand the technologies capabilities and capacity that we can access to serve our customers 

based on the regional nature of the flavors business and the concerns regarding the transportability of raw materials we have established smaller manufacturing facilities in our local markets that are focused on local needs products within the fragrances business are typically composed of compounds that are more stable and more transportable around the world consequently we have fewer manufacturing facilities within our fragrances business which produce compounds and ingredients for global distribution 

  

in 2014 we continued to invest in our facilities notably in emerging markets we opened our new creative  applications lab at our existing facility in jakarta indonesia and opened a new sales office and laboratory in chile construction is also ongoing of a new creative center and expansion of our manufacturing facilities in gebze turkey 

sustainability as a leading global creator of flavors and fragrances for a wide variety of consumer products sustainability has been an important part of how we do business our sustainability strategy which is closely aligned with our longterm business strategy was first formalized in 2011 and consists of four pillars our products our impact our sources and our people while the industry and our company constantly evolves we are committed to conducting our business in line with our dedication to the environment to society and to the shareholders customers and others that have placed their confidence in us in 2014 we were identified as a leader in climate change reporting and will be included in the climate disclosure leadership index compiled by the cdp formerly known as the carbon disclosure project in addition during 2014 a third party completed the installation of a solar panel field on iff property the solar panel field is the largest in the industry in addition to the installation of the solar panel field the agreement we entered into also called for the third party who is the owner of the solar panels to operate and maintain the installation for a multiyear period 

governmental regulation 

we develop produce and market our products in a number of jurisdictions throughout the world and are subject to federal regional and local legislation and regulations in each of the various countries our flavor and many of our fragrance products are intended for the food beverage and pharmaceutical industries which are subject to strict quality and regulatory standards as a result we are required to meet these strict standards which in recent years have become increasingly stringent 

in addition we are subject to various rules relating to health work safety and the environment at the local and international levels in the various countries in which we operate our manufacturing facilities throughout the world are subject to environmental standards relating to air emissions sewage discharges the use of hazardous materials waste disposal practices and cleanup of existing environmental contamination in recent years there has been a significant increase in the stringency of environmental regulation and enforcement of environmental standards and the costs of compliance have risen significantly we expect that the trend of increased regulation and disclosure will continue in the future 

our products and operations are subject to regulation by governmental agencies in each of the markets in which we operate these agencies include 1 the food and drug administration and equivalent international agencies that regulate the flavors and other ingredients in consumer products 2 the environmental protection agency and equivalent international agencies that regulate our fragrance compounds 3 the occupational safety and health administration and equivalent international agencies that regulate the working conditions in our manufacturing research laboratories and creative centers 4 local and international agencies that regulate trade and customs 5 the drug enforcement administration and other local or international agencies that regulate controlled chemicals that we use in our operations and 6 the chemical registrationnotification authorities that regulate chemicals that we use in or transport to the various countries in which we manufacture andor market our products we have seen an increase in registration and reporting requirements concerning the use of certain chemicals in a number of countries 

competition 

the flavors and fragrances market is part of a larger market which supplies a variety of ingredients and components that consumer products companies utilize in their products the broader market includes large multinational companies or smaller regional and local participants which supply products such as seasonings texturizers spices enzymes certain food related commodities fortified products and cosmetic ingredients 

the market for flavors and fragrances is highly competitive based on annual sales our main competitors consist of 1 the three other large global flavor and fragrance manufacturers givaudan firmenich and symrise 2 midsized companies 3 numerous small and local manufacturers with more limited research and development capabilities who focus on narrow market segments and local customers and 4 consumer product companies who may develop their own flavors or fragrances we together with the other top three companies represent approximately twothirds of the total estimated sales in the global flavors and fragrances subsegment of the broader market 

we believe that our ability to compete successfully in the flavors and fragrances market is based on 1 our understanding of consumers 2 innovation arising from the creative skills of our perfumers and flavorists and the technological advances resulting from our research and development activities 3 our ability to create products which are tailormade for our customers’ needs 4 developing strong customer intimacy and 5 driving efficiency in all that we do 

large multinational customers and increasingly midsized customers may limit the number of their suppliers placing some on “core lists” giving them priority for development and production of their new or modified products 

to compete more successfully in this environment we must make continued investments in customer relationships and tailor product research and development in order to anticipate customers’ needs provide effective service and secure and maintain inclusion on certain “core lists” 

employee relations 

at december 31 2014 we had approximately 6200 employees worldwide of whom approximately 1400 are employed in the united states we believe that relations with our employees are good

risk factors 

tableend

we routinely encounter and address risks in conducting our business some of these risks may cause our future results to be different  sometimes materially different  than we presently anticipate below are certain important operational and strategic risks that could adversely affect our business how we react to material future developments as well as how our competitors react to those developments could also affect our future results 

volatility and increases in the price of raw materials energy and transportation could harm our profits 

we use many different raw materials for our business including essential oils extracts and concentrates derived from fruits vegetables flowers woods and other botanicals animal products raw fruits organic chemicals and petroleumbased chemicals raw material costs continue to remain at elevated levels historically we have experienced the greatest amount of price volatility in natural products that represent approximately half of our raw material purchases availability and pricing of these natural products such as citrus and vanilla can be impacted by crop size and quality weather alternative land use and other factors which we cannot control 

if we are unable to increase the prices to our customers of our fragrance or flavor products to cover raw material and other input cost increases or if we are unable to achieve cost savings to offset such cost increases we could fail to meet our cost expectations and our profits and operating results could be adversely affected increases in prices of our products to customers may lead to declines in volume and we may not be able to accurately predict the volume impact of price increases which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

similarly commodities and energy prices are subject to significant volatility caused by market fluctuations supply and demand currency fluctuations production and transportation disruptions and other world events as we source many of our raw materials globally to help ensure quality control if the cost of energy shipping or transportation increases and we are unable to pass along these costs to our customers our profit margins would be adversely affected furthermore increasing our prices to our customers could result in longterm sales declines or loss of market share if our customers find alternative suppliers or choose to reformulate their consumer products to use fewer ingredients which could have an adverse longterm impact on our results of operations 

to mitigate our sourcing risk we maintain strategic stock levels for critical items however if we do not accurately estimate the amount of raw materials that will be used for the geographic region in which we will need these materials our margins could be adversely affected 

our international operations are subject to economic political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues cash flows or financial position 

we operate on a global basis with manufacturing and sales facilities in the united states europe africa the middle east latin america and greater asia during 2014 79 of our net sales were to customers outside the united states and we intend to continue expansion of our international operations as a result our business is increasingly exposed to risks inherent in international operations these risks which can vary substantially by market are described in many of the risk factors in this section and include the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these factors may increase in importance as we expand our operations in emerging markets as part of our growth strategy and the occurrence of any one or more of these factors could increase our costs and adversely affect our results of operations 

we have made investments in and are expanding our business into emerging markets and regions which exposes us to certain risks 

as part of our growth strategy we have increased our presence in emerging markets by expanding our manufacturing presence sales organization and product offerings in these markets and we expect to continue to focus on expanding our business in these markets in addition to the currency and international operation risks described above our operations in these markets may be subject to a variety of other risks these risks include economies that include consumers with limited or fluctuating disposable income and discretionary spending on which the end users of our products depend weak legal systems which may affect our ability to enforce our intellectual property and contractual rights exchange controls unstable governments and privatization or other government actions affecting taxes subsidies and incentive programs and the flow of goods and currency in conducting our business we move products from one country to another and may provide services in one country from a subsidiary located in another country accordingly we are vulnerable to abrupt changes in customs and tax regimes that may have significant negative impacts on our financial condition and operating results 

the increase in demand for consumer products using flavors and fragrances has been driven by factors outside of our control and if these factors do not persist our future growth could be adversely affected 

demand for consumer products using flavors and fragrances has been stimulated and broadened by changing social habits and consumer needs an expanding global middleclass and general economic growth especially in emerging markets approximately 50 of our sales during 2014 were generated in emerging markets and we expect emerging markets to continue to significantly contribute to our future growth increasing consumer demand for products using flavors and fragrances is dependent on factors such as increases in personal income dualearner households teenage population leisure time consumer health concerns and urbanization and by the continued growth in world’s population all of which are outside of our control changes in any number of external economic factors or changes in social or consumer preferences could materially adversely impact our results of operations accordingly our future growth will depend upon the continued economic growth and development of consumer spending on products for which we supply flavors and fragrances in these global markets 

our results of operations may be negatively affected by the impact of currency fluctuation or devaluation in the international markets in which we operate 

we have significant operations outside the us the results of which are reported in the local currency and then translated into us dollars at applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements the exchange rates between these currencies and the us dollar have fluctuated and will continue to do so in the future changes in exchange rates between these local currencies and the us dollar will affect the recorded levels of sales profitability assets andor liabilities additionally volatility in currency exchange rates may adversely impact our financial condition cash flows or liquidity although we employ a variety of techniques to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations including sourcing strategies and a limited number of foreign currency hedging activities we cannot guarantee that such hedging and risk management strategies will be effective and our results of operations could be adversely affected 

volatility in the global economy may adversely affect consumer spending and may negatively impact our business and operating results 

our flavors and fragrances are components of a wide assortment of global consumer products throughout the world since mid2008 the global economy has experienced significant recessionary pressures and declines in consumer confidence and economic growth while some segments of the global economy appear to be recovering the ongoing global recessionary economic environment in europe has and may in the near future increase unemployment and underemployment decrease salaries and wage rates increase inflation or result in other marketwide cost pressures that will adversely affect demand for consumer products in both developed and emerging markets in addition growth rates in the emerging markets have moderated from previous levels reduced consumer spending may cause changes in our customer orders including reduced demand for our flavors and fragrances increased pressure to reduce the price of our flavors and fragrances or order cancellations to the extent that the volatility in global economic conditions continues our sales profitability and overall operating results could be adversely affected 

we may not successfully develop and introduce new products that appeal to our customers or our customers may not accurately anticipate and respond to global consumer market trends which may adversely affect our results of operations 

our growth and performance largely depends on our ability to successfully develop and introduce new products and product improvements that appeal to our customers and ultimately to global consumer needs we must continually anticipate and react to in a timely and costefficient manner changes in consumer preferences and demands we cannot be certain that we will successfully achieve our innovation goals such as the development of new molecules delivery methods and other technologies we currently spend approximately 8 of our sales on research and development however such investments may only generate future revenues to the extent that we are able to successfully develop products that meet our customers’ specifications can be delivered at an acceptable price and are accepted by the targeted consumer market furthermore there may be significant lag times from the time we incur rd costs to the time that these rd costs may result in increased revenue consequently even when we “win” a project our ability to generate revenues as a result of these investments is subject to numerous customer economic and other risks that are outside of our control including delays by our customers in the launch of a new product poor performance of our thirdparty vendors reduced or insufficient resources allocated by our customers to promoting the new product anticipated sales by our customers not being realized or changes in market preferences or demands or disruptive innovations by our competitors 

if we are unable to maintain the integrity of our raw materials supply chain and finished goods it may result in regulatory noncompliance litigation costs and harm to our reputation all of which may adversely impact sales and our results of operations 

the development manufacture and sale of our products are subject to various regulatory requirements in each of the countries in which our products are developed manufactured and sold in addition we are subject to product safety and compliance requirements established by the industry or similar oversight bodies we use a variety of strategies methodologies and tools to i identify current product standards ii assess relative risks in our supply chain that can impact product integrity iii monitor internal and external performance and iv test raw materials and finished goods to minimize the likelihood of product or process noncompliance 

gaps in our operational processes could adversely affect the quality of our finished products and result in a regulatory noncompliance event if a product noncompliance event were to go undetected it could subject us to customer claims recalls penalties litigation costs and settlements remediation costs or loss of sales as our flavors and fragrances are used as ingredients in many products meant for human consumption these consequences would be exacerbated if our customer did not identify the defect and there was a resulting impact at the consumer level such a result could lead to potentially large scale adverse publicity recalls and potential consumer litigation furthermore adverse publicity about our products including concerns about product safety or similar issues whether real or perceived could harm our reputation and result in an immediate adverse effect on our sales as well as require us to utilize significant resources to rebuild our reputation 

a disruption in operations or our supply chain could adversely affect our business and financial results 

as a company engaged in development manufacturing and distribution on a global scale we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities including industrial accidents environmental events strikes and other labor disputes disruptions in supply chain or information systems loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites product quality control safety licensing requirements and other regulatory issues as well as natural disasters and other external factors over which we have no control if any of these events were to occur it could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results in addition while we have manufacturing facilities throughout the world certain of our facilities are the sole source of a specific ingredient or product if the manufacture of these ingredients or products was disrupted the cost of relocating or replacing their production or reformulating them may be substantial which could result in production delays or otherwise have an adverse effect on our operating results financial condition or cash flows 

our performance may be adversely impacted if we are not successful in managing our inventory andor working capital balances 

we evaluate our inventory balances of materials based on shelf life expected sourcing levels known uses and anticipated demand based on forecasted customer order activity and changes in our productsales mix efficient inventory management is a key component of our business success financial returns profitability to be successful we must maintain sufficient inventory levels and an appropriate productsales mix to meet our customers’ demands without allowing those levels to increase to such an extent that the costs associated with storing and holding other inventory adversely impact our financial results if our buying 

decisions do not accurately predict sourcing levels customer trends or our expectations about customer needs are inaccurate we may have to take unanticipated markdowns or impairment charges to dispose of the excess or obsolete inventory which can adversely impact our financial results additionally we believe excess inventory levels of raw materials with a short shelf life in our manufacturing facilities subjects us to the risk of increased inventory shrinkage if we are not successful in managing our inventory balances and shrinkage our results from operations and cash flows from operations may be negatively affected 

the company sells certain accounts receivable on a nonrecourse basis to unrelated financial institutions under “factoring” agreements that are sponsored solely and individually by certain customers the cost of participating in these programs was immaterial to our results in all periods should we choose not to participate or if these programs were no longer available it could reduce our cash from operations in the period in which the arrangement ends 

our ongoing optimization of our manufacturing facilities may not be as effective as we anticipate and we may fail to realize the expected cost savings and increased efficiencies 

as part of our strategy we seek to enhance our manufacturing efficiency and align our geographic manufacturing footprint with our expectations of future growth to operate more efficiently and control costs from time to time we execute rationalization activities which include manufacturing facility consolidations for example during 2014 we closed our augusta georgia facility and relocated and consolidated its operations into other facilities and we are in the midst of relocating our ingredients facility in hangzhou china our ability to realize anticipated cost savings synergies and revenue enhancements from these activities may be affected by a number of factors and may pose significant risks including 

 

 

 

 

 

furthermore our rationalization and consolidation actions may not be as effective as we anticipate and we may fail to realize the cost savings we expect from these actions actual charges costs and adjustments due to these activities may vary materially from our estimates and these activities may require cash and noncash integration and implementation costs or charges in excess of budgeted amounts which could offset any such savings and other synergies and therefore could have an adverse effect on our margins 

we may not achieve expected efficiencies related to the proximity of our customers’ production facilities to our manufacturing facilities or with respect to existing or future production relocation plans 

as part of our strategy we manage our global manufacturing footprint to enhance manufacturing efficiencies andalign with our expectations of future growth and technology needs many of our facilities are located in close proximity to our customers in order to minimize both our customers’ and our own costs however we may not have sufficient demand to utilize all of our production capacity and may be required to ship excess products to other regions in which we operate which will increase our costs and decrease our margins in addition our expected growth may not be realized which would result in excess capacity and reduced margins 

we are subject to laws and regulations governing antibribery and corruption and noncompliance with such laws and regulations could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we are subject to a wide range of laws and regulations to prevent corruption bribery and other unethical business practices including the us foreign corrupt practices act or fcpa and similar laws and regulations in other countries these laws and regulations generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or other benefits in addition we have manufacturing operations in some jurisdictions which pose potentially elevated risks of fraud or corruption or increased risk of internal control issues as needed we conduct internal investigations control testing and compliance reviews to help ensure that we are in compliance with applicable corruption and similar laws and regulations we could be subject to inquiries or investigations by government and 

other regulatory bodies any determination that our operations or activities are not in compliance with the fcpa or similar international laws and regulations could expose us to significant fines penalties or other sanctions that may harm our business and reputation 

our ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights 

we rely on patents and trade secrets to protect our intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to protect our intellectual property rights we often rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary fragrance and flavor formulations as this does not require us to publicly file information regarding our intellectual property from time to time a third party may claim that we have infringed upon their intellectual property rights or a third party may infringe upon our intellectual property as a result of such third party claims we could incur significant costs in connection with legal actions to assert our intellectual property rights or to defend ourselves from assertions of invalidity infringement or misappropriation for those intellectual property rights that are protected by way of trade secrets this litigation could result in even higher costs and potentially the loss of certain rights as we would not have a perfected intellectual property right that precludes others from making using or selling our products or processes 

for intellectual property rights that we seek to protect through patents we cannot be certain that these rights if obtained will not later be opposed invalidated or circumvented in addition even if such rights are obtained in the united states the laws of some of the other countries in which our products are or may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states if other parties were to infringe on our intellectual property rights or if a third party successfully asserted that we had infringed on their intellectual property rights it could materially and adversely affect our future results of operations by i reducing the price that we could obtain in the marketplace for products which are based on such rights ii increasing the royalty or other fees that we may be required to pay in connection with such rights or iii limiting the volume if any of such products that we can sell 

our business is highly competitive and if we are unable to compete effectively our sales and results of operations will suffer 

the market for flavors and fragrances is highly competitive we face vigorous competition from companies throughout the world including multinational and specialized flavor and fragrance companies as well as consumer product companies who may develop their own flavors or fragrances some of our competitors specialize in one or more of our product segments while others participate in many of our product segments in addition some of our global competitors may have greater resources than we do or may have proprietary products that could permit them to respond to changing business and economic conditions more effectively than we can consolidation of our competitors may exacerbate these risks 

competition in our business is based on innovation product quality regulatory compliance pricing quality of our customer service the support provided by our marketing and application groups and our understanding of consumers it is difficult for us to predict the timing and scale of our competitors’ actions in these areas the discovery and development of new flavor and fragrance materials protection of the company’s intellectual property and development and retention of key employees are important issues in our ability to compete in our business increased competition by existing or future competitors including aggressive price competition could result in the potential loss of substantial sales or create the need for us to reduce prices or increase spending and this could have an adverse impact on sales and profitability 

large multinational customers and increasingly midsized customers may limit the number of their suppliers giving those that remain on “core lists” priority for new or modified products to compete more successfully in this environment we must continue to make investments in customer relationships and tailor product research and development in order to anticipate customers’ needs provide effective service and secure and maintain inclusion on certain “core lists” if we are unable to do so it could adversely impact our future results of operations 

our success depends on attracting and retaining talented people within our business significant shortfalls in recruitment or retention could adversely affect our ability to compete and achieve our strategic goals 

attracting developing and retaining talented employees including our perfumers and flavorists is essential to the successful delivery of our products and success in the marketplace competition for these employees can be intense the ability to attract and retain talented employees is critical in the development of new products and technologies which is an integral component of our growth strategy however we may not be able to attract and retain such employees in the future if we experience significant shortfalls in recruitment or retention our ability to effectively compete with our competitors and to grow our business could be adversely affected 

our reliance on a limited base of suppliers may result in a disruption to our business and may adversely affect our financial results 

for certain raw materials we rely on a limited number of suppliers and we may not have readily available alternatives if we are unable to maintain our supplier arrangements and relationships and are unable to obtain the quantity quality and price levels needed for our business or if any of our key suppliers becomes insolvent or experiences other financial distress we could experience disruptions in production and our financial results could be adversely affected 

our results of operations may be negatively impacted by the outcome of uncertainties related to litigation 

we are involved in a number of legal claims and litigation including claims related to indirect taxes we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of such litigation in addition we cannot provide assurance that future events will not result in an increase in the number of claims or require an increase in the amount accrued for any such claims or require accrual for one or more claims that has not been previously accrued 

the level of returns on pension and postretirement plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used for valuation purposes could affect our earnings and cash flows in future periods changes in government regulations could also affect our pension and postretirement plan expenses and funding requirements 

the funding obligations for our pension plans are impacted by the performance of the financial markets particularly the equity markets and interest rates funding obligations are determined under government regulations and are measured each year based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date if the financial markets do not provide the longterm returns that are expected under the governmental funding calculations we could be required to make larger contributions the equity markets can be very volatile and therefore our estimate of future contribution requirements can change dramatically in relatively short periods of time similarly changes in interest rates and legislation enacted by governmental authorities can impact the timing and amounts of contribution requirements an adverse change in the funded status of the plans could significantly increase our required contributions in the future and adversely impact our liquidity 

assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans are determined by us in consultation with outside consultants and advisors in the event that we determine that changes are warranted in the assumptions used such as the discount rate expected longterm rate of return on assets or expected health care costs our future pension and postretirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease due to changing market conditions or changes in the participant population the assumptions that we use may differ from actual results which could have a significant impact on our pension and postretirement liabilities and related costs and funding requirements 

impairment charges on our longlived assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

future events may occur that could adversely affect the reported value of our longlived assets and require impairment charges such events may include but are not limited to strategic decisions made in response to changes in economic and competitive conditions the impact of the economic environment on our sales and our relationship with significant customers or business partners or a sustained decline in our stock price we continue to evaluate the impact of economic and other developments on our business to assess whether impairment indicators are present accordingly we may perform impairment tests more frequently than annually required based on changes in the economic environment and other factors and these tests could result in impairment charges in the future 

our financial results may be adversely impacted by the failure to successfully execute acquisitions collaborations and joint ventures 

from time to time we may evaluate and enter into acquisitions collaborations or joint ventures that align with our strategic objectives the success of such activity depends in part upon our ability to identify suitable targets or partners perform effective assessments prior to contract execution negotiate contract terms and if applicable obtain governmental approvals for example in january 2014 we completed the acquisition of aromor flavors and fragrances ltd a manufacturer and marketer of complex specialty ingredients these activities may present certain financial managerial and operational risks including diversion of management’s attention from existing core businesses difficulties integrating or separating businesses from existing operations including employee integration and challenges presented by acquisitions collaborations or joint ventures which may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made if the acquisitions collaborations or joint ventures are not successfully implemented or completed there could be a negative impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

changes in our tax rates the adoption of new us or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our future results 

we are subject to taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in liabilities for uncertain tax positions cost of repatriations or changes in tax laws or their interpretation in addition the current administration and congress have announced proposals for new us tax legislation that if adopted could affect our tax rate any of these changes could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 

we are also subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and foreign tax authorities in those countries in which we operate 

we have and will continue to implement transfer pricing policies among our various operations located in different countries these transfer pricing policies are a significant component of the management of our operations across international boundaries and overall financial results many countries routinely examine transfer pricing policies of taxpayers subject to their jurisdiction challenge transfer pricing policies aggressively where there is potential noncompliance and impose significant interest charges and penalties where noncompliance is determined there can be no assurance that a governmental authority will not challenge these policies more aggressively in the future or if challenged that we will prevail we could suffer significant costs related to one or more challenges to our transfer pricing 

we may be subject to assessments or audits in the future in any of the countries in which we operate the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals and while we do not believe the results that follow would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition such results could have a material effect on our income tax provision net income or cash flows in the period or periods in which that determination is made 

our operations may be affected by greenhouse emissions and climate change and related regulations 

the availability of raw materials and energy supplies fluctuate in markets throughout the world climate change may also affect the availability and price of key raw materials including natural products used in the manufacture of our products in order to mitigate the risk of price increases and shortages our purchasers have developed various sourcing strategies including multiple suppliers inventory management systems various geographic suppliers and longterm agreements to mitigate risk 

in addition to market forces there are various regulatory efforts relating to climate change that may increase the cost of raw materials particularly energy used to operate our facilities that could materially impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

information technology system failures or disruptions or breaches of our network security may adversely affect our business interrupt our operations subject us to increased operating costs and expose us to litigation 

we have information technology systems that support our business processes including product formulas product development sales order processing production distribution finance and intracompany communications throughout the world these systems may be susceptible to outages due to fire floods power loss telecommunications failures natural disasters breakins and similar events effective response to such disruptions will require effort and diligence on the part of our thirdparty vendors and employees to avoid any adverse impact to our information technology systems in addition our systems and proprietary data stored electronically may be vulnerable to computer viruses cybercrime computer hacking and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering if such unauthorized use of our systems were to occur data related to our product formulas product development and other proprietary information could be compromised the occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our business interrupt our operations subject us to increased operating costs and expose us to litigation 

the potential government regulation of certain of our product development initiatives is uncertain and we may be subject to adverse consequences if we fail to comply with applicable regulations 

as part of our ingredients research program we seek to collaborate with research institutions and companies throughout the world including biotechnology companies however it is unclear whether any of our product developments will be classified as genetically modified food products subject to regulation as a biotechnology product the manufacture of biotechnology products is subject to applicable current good manufacturing practice cgmp regulations as prescribed by the food and drug administration and the applicable standards prescribed by european commission and the competent authorities of european 

union member states and to other rules and regulations prescribed by foreign regulatory authorities compliance with these regulations can be expensive and time consuming such regulation could also subject us to requirements for labeling and traceability which may cause our customers to avoid our affected products and seek our competitors’ products this may result in our inability to realize any benefit from our investment and have an adverse effect on our operating results

legal proceedings 

tableend

we are subject to various claims and legal actions in the ordinary course of our business 

tax claims 

we are currently involved in administrative and legal proceedings with the spanish tax authorities that challenge tax deductions taken in our spanish subsidiaries’ tax returns and allege claims of tax avoidance 

in 2012 we reached an overall settlement with the spanish tax authorities regarding income tax deductions taken by our spanish subsidiaries for the 20042010 fiscal years and entered into a multiyear agreement with the spanish tax authorities that established the tax basis for our activities in spain for 2012 through 2014 consistent with the key principles preliminarily agreed upon as part of the overall settlement the settlement agreement did not address the assessments for the 20022003 fiscal years as these were further along in the spanish judicial process and did not address the 2011 fiscal year during 2013 we reached a settlement with the spanish tax authorities related to the 2011 fiscal year on a basis consistent with the overall settlement reached for the 20042010 fiscal years 

with respect to the audits of 20022003 fiscal years the spanish tax authorities imposed assessments aggregating euro 224 million   286 million  including aggregate estimated interest the company appealed these assessments however in 

february 2013 the appellate court upheld the administrative ruling with respect to the 2003 tax assessment and the related tax avoidance claims the company decided not to pursue the appeals process with respect to the 2003 tax assessment and paid euro 208 million 273 million based on the exchange rate at the respective payment dates in connection with the 2003 tax assessment in 2013 in june 2013 the appellate court ruled against us on our appeal of the 2002 income tax assessment and related claims which the company also decided not to appeal however this case did not have a related tax exposure associated with it in an unrelated matter there was a remaining aggregate assessment related to the 2002 fiscal year of euro 19 million   23 million  as of december 31 2014  to proceed with its appeal of the tax assessment for the 2002 fiscal year the company was required to post bank guarantees as of december 31 2014  the company had remaining posted bank guarantees of euro 19 million   23 million  associated with the 2002 appeal on february 11 2015 the company received a favorable ruling on this appeal 

in addition to the above the company has also been a party to four  dividend withholding tax controversies in spain in which the spanish tax authorities alleged that the company’s spanish subsidiaries underpaid withholding taxes during the 1995  2001  fiscal years the company had previously appealed each of these controversies during 2012 the company received unfavorable decisions on the first three cases at december 31 2014  the company had euro 47 million   56 million  reflected in income taxes payable in connection with these three cases and had posted bank guarantees of euro 47 million   56 million  in order to proceed with the appeals in these three cases the fourth case was heard by the spanish national high court in october 2014 and we received a favorable ruling accordingly during the fourth quarter of 2014 we reversed the total reserve related to the 2001 fiscal year with a value of euro 36 million  of 43 million  

the spanish tax authorities also alleged claims related to capital tax positions arising from the business structure adopted by our spanish subsidiaries the aggregate amount of these claims was euro 96 million 132 million including aggregate estimated interest through december 31 2014 our previous settlement in 2012 with the spanish tax authorities addressed only the income tax assessments and did not address the capital tax positions in connection with their ruling on our 2002 income tax assessment the appellate court rejected one of the two bases upon which we based our capital tax position during 2013 the company was notified that the spanish high court of justice ruled against us in regards to the 2002 capital tax case as a result the company recorded a charge of euro 96 million 130 million or 91 million after tax included in selling and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31 2013 on january 22 2014 we filed an appeal in order to avoid future interest costs in the event our appeal is unsuccessful we paid 112 million representing the principal amount during the first quarter of 2014 such amount will be refundable if we prevail in our appeal 

we do not currently believe that any of our pending tax assessments even if ultimately resolved against us would have a material impact on our financial condition 

environmental 

over the past 20 years various federal and state authorities and private parties have claimed that we are a potentially responsible party “prp” as a generator of waste materials for alleged pollution at a number of waste sites operated by third parties located principally in new jersey and have sought to recover costs incurred and to be incurred to clean up the sites 

we have been identified as a prp at nine facilities operated by third parties at which investigation andor remediation activities may be ongoing we analyze our potential liability on at least a quarterly basis we accrue for environmental liabilities when they are probable and estimable we estimate our share of the total future cost for these sites to be less than 5 million 

while joint and several liability is authorized under federal and state environmental laws we believe the amounts we have paid and anticipate paying in the future for cleanup costs and damages at all sites are not material and will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity this assessment is based upon among other things the involvement of other prps at most of the sites the status of the proceedings including various settlement agreements and consent decrees and the extended time period over which payments will likely be made there can be no assurance however that future events will not require us to materially increase the amounts we anticipate paying for cleanup costs and damages at these sites and that such increased amounts will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

overview 

we create manufacture and supply flavors and fragrances for the food beverage personal care and householdproducts industries either in the form of compounds or individual ingredients our flavors and fragrance compounds combine a large number of ingredients that are blended mixed or reacted together to produce proprietary formulas created by our perfumers and flavorists 

flavors are the key building blocks that impart taste in processed food and beverage products and as such play a significant role in determining consumer preference of the end products in which they are used while we are a global leader our flavors business is more regional in nature with different formulas that reflect local tastes and ingredients as a leading creator of flavors we help our customers deliver on the promise of delicious and healthy foods and drinks that appeal to consumers our flavors compounds are ultimately used by our customers in four enduse categories 1 savory 2 beverages 3 sweet pharmaceutical and oral care “sweet” and 4 dairy 

our fragrances are a key component in the world’s finest perfumes and bestknown consumer brands including beauty care fabric care personal wash and home care products in 2014 we announced that we realigned our creative and commercial teams within our fragrance compounds activities resulting in two newlydefined broad market categories 1 fine fragrances and 2 consumer fragrances consumer fragrances consists of five enduse categories fabric care home care personal wash hair care and toiletries prior to the realignment our fragrance compounds activities consisted of two broad categories 1 fine fragrance and beauty care and 2 functional fragrances in addition fragrance ingredients which are used internally and sold to third parties including customers and competitors for use in preparation of compounds are also included in the fragrances business unit 

the flavors and fragrances market is part of a larger market which supplies a variety of ingredients and components that consumer products companies utilize in their products the broader market includes large multinational companies or smaller regional and local participants which supply products such as seasonings texturizers spices enzymes certain food related commodities fortified products and cosmetic ingredients the flavors and fragrances market is estimated to be at least 18 billion however the exact size of the global market is not available due to fragmentation of data we together with the other top three companies are estimated to comprise approximately twothirds of the total estimated sales in the global flavors and fragrances subsegment of the broader market 

development of new flavors and fragrance compounds is driven by a variety of sources including requests from our customers who are in need of a specific flavor or fragrance for use in a new or modified consumer product or as a result of internal initiatives stemming from our consumer insights program our product development team works in partnership with our scientists and researchers to optimize the consumer appeal of the flavor or fragrance it then becomes a collaborative process between our researchers our product development team and our customers to perfect the flavor or fragrance so that it is ready to be included in the final consumer product 

our 25 largest customers accounted for 53 of total sales in 2014  this percentage has remained fairly constant for several years a key factor for commercial success is inclusion on our strategic customers’ core supplier lists which provides opportunities to win new business we are on the core supplier lists of a large majority of our global and strategic customers within fragrances and flavors 

sales in 2014  grew 5  both on a reported basis and in local currency lc terms with the acquisition of aromor adding approximately 1  to both reported and local currency basis amounts flavors achieved lc growth of 4  and fragrances 

achieved lc growth of 7  in 2014  the lc growth reflects new win performance net of losses in both flavors and fragrance compounds partially offset by volume erosion on existing business in addition fragrance ingredients sales were up 18 driven largely by the aromor acquisition overall our 2014  results continued to be driven by our strong emerging market presence that represented 50 of total sales and experienced 6 lc growth in 2014  from a geographic perspective all regions delivered lc growth on a consolidated basis in 2014  led by latin america la with 7 lc sales growth 

the year 2014 included an extra week of activity due to the timing of our fiscal yearend as discussed in note 1 of the consolidated financial statements the impact of this week was not material to our results of operations for the year ended december 31 2014 

2014  sales by business unit 



  



financial performance overview 

reported sales for 2014  increased 5  yearoveryear including approximately 1 growth from the acquisition of aromor we continue to benefit from our diverse portfolio of enduse product categories and geographies and had growth in all four regions and in consumer fragrances fragrance ingredients and flavor compounds both flavors and fragrances benefited from new win performance net of losses that was partially offset by volume erosion on existing business exchange rate variations were flat in yearoveryear sales the effect of exchange rates can vary by business and region depending upon the mix of sales by country as well as the relative percentage of local sales priced in us dollars versus local currencies lc sales growth of 5  in 2014  was consistent with our longterm strategic target of 46 lc growth we saw good lc sales growth during each quarter of 2014  despite the impact of volume erosion on existing business regarding our 2015  outlook 

we believe that lc sales growth will be in line with our longterm targets while operating profit growth is expected to be at the low end of the range in light of a stronger us dollar versus most currencies and higher incentive compensation expense in addition we believe eps growth will be high singledigits driven by operating profit growth 

on a longterm basis we expect that sales growth for the industry will generally be in line with the underlying assumptions that support our longterm strategic goals albeit with some risk in the near term given the continuing global economic uncertainty we believe changing social habits resulting from increased disposable income improved focus on personal health and wellness awareness should help drive growth of our consumer product customers’ businesses 

gross margins increased 60  basis points bps yearoveryear due to solid sales growth and benefits from cost and productivity initiatives that more than offset the slightly unfavorable price versus input cost dynamic during 2014 however the overall raw material cost base remains elevated including certain categories where prices remain near all time highs we believe input costs will increase approximately 1 in 2015 as higher prices on certain categories such as naturals will more than offset potential benefits associated with oilbased derivatives that are expected to occur later in 2015 we continue to seek improvements in our margins through operational performance and mix enhancement 

operating profit increased 760 million  to 5923 million   192  of sales in 2014  compared to 5163 million   175  of sales in 2013  included in 2014 were operational improvement initiative costs of 25 million restructuring and other charges net of 13 million and 51 million of accelerated depreciation included in cost of goods sold related to the fragrance ingredients rationalization and several locations in asia excluding these charges adjusted operating profit was 6013 million 195 of sales for 2014  included in 2013 were operational improvement initiative costs of 37 million primarily related to closing a smaller facility in europe and certain manufacturing activities in asia while transferring production to larger facilities in each respective region and accelerated depreciation associated with several locations in asia as well as restructuring costs of 74 million related to the fragrance ingredients rationalization in addition 2013 included a 130 million charge related to the spanish capital tax case excluding these charges adjusted operating profit was 5404 million 183 of sales for 2013 the yearoveryear improvement reflects sales volume growth combined with reduced rd selling and administrative expenses as a percentages of sales all of which were driven largely by favorable yearoveryear incentive compensation expenses the results of aromor were not significant to the consolidated financial performance of the company for 2014 

although we are in the process of refreshing the key elements of our strategic priorities we continued to execute against the core elements of the strategic priorities identified during our in depth 2010 strategic assessment in particular ensuring that we have adequate resources and capabilities in place to support planned growth in emerging markets through investments and installing key technologies globally was the primary driver related to the 1432 million   46  of sales of capital spending during 2014  we anticipate capital spending in 2015  to be 45 of sales net of potential grants and other reimbursements from government authorities that we expect to receive as we continue to prioritize investments in emerging markets and flavors 

cash flows from operations were 5184 million  or 168  of sales in 2014  as compared to cash flows from operations of 4076 million  or 138  of sales during 2013  excluding an incremental pension contribution of 15 million yearoveryear and total spanish tax payments of 33 million related to the 2003 and 2011 fiscal years made during 2013 our adjusted cash flow from operations was 4556 million in 2013  representing an increase of 628 million in 2014 from 2013

strategic initiative 

in december 2011 we recorded a charge to cover a restructuring which involved a reduction in workforce as well as a realignment of responsibilities in our fragrances business unit this alignment partly addresses issues identified in our 2010 strategic review process towards improving the underperforming areas of our portfolio it resulted in the redeployment of creative resources in emerging markets and the reorganization from a regional to a global category structure we implemented a plan to streamline business operations globally which resulted in the elimination of 72 positions across fragrances flavors and corporate functions as a result we recorded a provision for severance costs of 98 million to restructuring and other charges we recorded an additional net charge of 17 million during the twelve months ended december 31 2012 principally attributable to adjustments based on the final separation terms with affected employees we realized pretax savings of approximately 8 million in 2012

based upon the periodend estimates regarding the separation agreements we increased our provision for severance costs by 44 million in 2010 the remaining 57 million of the restructuring charges in 2010 was mainly due to accelerated depreciation and other restructuring related costs pertaining to the rationalization of our fragrances and ingredients operations in europe

effective utilization of the cash generated by our international operations is a critical component of our tax strategy strategic dividend repatriation from foreign subsidiaries creates us taxable income which enables us to realize us deferred tax assets the company regularly repatriates in the form of dividends from its nonus subsidiaries a portion of its current year earnings to fund financial obligations in the us these repatriations of current year earnings totaled 2480 million 1280 million and 976 million in 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively 

cash flows from operating activities 

operating cash flows in 2014  were 5184 million  compared to 4076 million  in 2013 which included 48 million of cash payments related to the spanish tax cases and incremental us pension contributions and 3238 million  in 2012 which included an outflow of cash of 1055 million associated with the spanish tax settlement as discussed in note 9 to the 

consolidated financial statements the cash flow impact associated with core working capital trade receivables inventories and accounts payable improved compared to 2013  operating cash flows versus the prior year also reflect strong net income growth and improvements in working capital as a percentage of sales although we have appealed the lower court ruling on our spanish capital tax case we made payment of 112 million representing the principal amount to the spanish government relating to the case during the first quarter of 2014 which is refundable if we prevail on our appeal 

working capital current assets less current liabilities totaled 11912 million  at yearend 2014  compared to 10925 million  at december 31 2013  this increase in working capital of 987 million  primarily reflects strong sales growth and inventory increases associated with plant startups the company sold certain accounts receivable on a nonrecourse basis to unrelated financial institutions under “factoring” agreements that are sponsored solely and individually by certain customers we believe that participating in the factoring programs strengthens our relationships with these customers and provides operational efficiencies we estimate that as a result of participating in the programs there was a beneficial impact to cash inflows from operations of approximately 33 million 7 million and 18 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively the cost of participating in these programs was immaterial to our results in all periods 

cash flows used in investing activities 

net investing activities in 2014  utilized 2213 million  compared to 1054 million  and 1143 million  in 2013  and 2012  respectively the increase in the investing activities was principally driven by the acquisition of aromor in the first quarter of 2014 

additions to property plant and equipment were 1432 million  1342 million  and 1261 million  in 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively and are again expected to be 45 of sales in 2015  net of potential grants and other reimbursements from government authorities that we expect to receive investments were largely focused on emerging markets and new technology consistent with our strategy 

on january 16 2014 the company completed the acquisition of aromor flavors and fragrances ltd a privately held manufacturer and marketer of complex specialty ingredients that are used in fragrances and flavors iff funded the transaction with cash 

cash flows used in provided by financing activities 

net financing activities in 2014  had an outflow of 2023 million  compared to an outflow of 2170 million  and an inflow of 254 million  in 2013  and 2012  respectively the decrease in outflow of cash used in financing activities in 2014  as compared to 2013  principally reflects higher incremental dividend payments and treasury share repurchases in 2014 which were more than offset by the repayment of longterm debt of 100 million made in july 2013 the outflow of cash used in financing activities in 2013 compared to the inflow of cash in 2012 principally reflects the repayment of longterm debt of 100 million made in 2013 and changes in the revolving credit facility borrowings in 2013 compared to 2012 

at december 31 2014  we had 9423 million  of debt outstanding compared to 9328 million  outstanding at december 31 2013  

we paid dividends totaling 1332 million  873 million  and 1309 million  in 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively the cash dividend declared per share in 2014  2013  and 2012  was 172  146 and 130 respectively 

in december 2012 the board of directors authorized a 250 million share repurchase program which commenced in the first quarter of 2013 and is expected to be completed by the end of 2014 based on the total remaining amount of 109 million  available under the repurchase program approximately 11 million  shares or 14  of shares outstanding based on the market price and shares outstanding as of december 31 2014  could be repurchased under the program as of december 31 2014  the purchases will be made from time to time on the open market or through private transactions as market and business conditions warrant repurchased shares will be placed into treasury stock 

capital resources 

operating cash flow provides the primary source of funds for capital investment needs dividends paid to shareholders and debt repayments we anticipate that cash flows from operations and availability under our existing credit facilities are sufficient to meet our investing and financing needs for at least the next eighteen months we regularly assess our capital structure including both current and longterm debt instruments as compared to our cash generation and investment needs in order to provide ample flexibility and to optimize our leverage ratios we believe our existing cash balances are sufficient to meet our debt service requirements 

credit facility and senior notes 

we supplement shortterm liquidity with access to capital markets mainly through bank credit facilities and issuance of commercial paper we did not issue commercial paper during 2014  and 2013  

credit facility 

in april 2014 we amended and restated our unsecured revolving credit facility including to modify the available tranches reduce the applicable margin on the interest rate on advances under the credit facility and extend the maturity date of the credit facility to april 2019 

there are two tranches under the credit facility the tranche a facility is available in us dollars euros swiss francs japanese yen and british sterling in an aggregate amount up to an equivalent of 4560 million with a sublimit of 250 million for swing line borrowings the tranche b facility is available in euros swiss francs japanese yen and british sterling in an aggregate amount up to an equivalent of 4940 million the credit facility is available for general corporate purposes and may be extended for up to two additional oneyear periods at the company’s request subject to the agreement of the lenders having commitments representing more than 50 of the aggregate commitments of all lenders under the credit facility borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at an annual rate of libor plus a margin currently 1125 bps linked to our credit rating the interest rate under our credit facility at december 31 2014 was 141 the credit facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants including the requirement for us to maintain at the end of each fiscal quarter a ratio of net debt for borrowed money to adjusted ebitda in respect of the previous 12month period of not more than 325 to 1 based on this ratio at december 31 2014  our covenant compliance would provide overall borrowing capacity of 18318 million  

on april 26 2013 the company repaid the full amount outstanding under the credit facility 2831 million as of december 31 2014  we had no borrowings under the credit facility the amount which we are able to draw down on under the credit facility is limited by financial covenants as described in more detail below our drawdown capacity on the credit facility was 9404 million  at december 31 2014  see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the credit facility 

at december 31 2014  and 2013  we were in compliance with all financial and other covenants including the net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio at december 31 2014  our net debtadjusted ebitda 1 ratio was 065  to 1 as defined by the credit facility well below the financial covenants of existing outstanding debt failure to comply with the financial and other covenants under our debt agreements would constitute default and would allow the lenders to accelerate the maturity of all indebtedness under the related agreement if such acceleration were to occur we would not have sufficient liquidity available to repay the indebtedness we would likely have to seek amendments under the agreements for relief from the financial covenants or repay the debt with proceeds from the issuance of new debt or equity andor asset sales if necessary we may be unable to amend the agreements or raise sufficient capital to repay such obligations in the event the maturities are accelerated

other commitments 

compliance with existing governmental requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment has not materially affected our operations earnings or competitive position in 2014  and 2013  we spent 43 million and 17 million on capital projects and 192 million and 189 million respectively in operating expenses and governmental charges for the purpose of complying with such regulations expenditures for these purposes will continue for the foreseeable future in addition we are party to a number of proceedings brought under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act or similar state statutes it is expected that the impact of any judgments in or voluntary settlements of such proceedings will not be material to our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

contractual obligations 

at december 31 2014  we had contractual payment obligations due within the time periods as specified in the following table   



 

 40 

concerning worldwide aggregate operating leases are contained in note 17 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

 the table above does not include 231 million of the total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions and approximately 22 million of associated accrued interest of which 12 million is expected to be paid in the next 12 months due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential cash flows the company is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the amount and period in which the remaining liabilities might be paid 

critical accounting policies and use of estimates 

our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements as disclosed in note 1 the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and accompanying disclosures these estimates are based on management’s best judgment of current events and actions that we may undertake in the future actual results may ultimately differ from estimates 

those areas requiring the greatest degree of management judgment or deemed most critical to our financial reporting involve 

the periodic assessment of potential impairment of intangible assets acquired in business combinations  we currently have net intangible assets including goodwill of 7520 million  in assessing the potential for impairment of goodwill management uses the most current actual and forecasted operating data available and current market based assumptions in accordance with the criteria in asc 350 in 2012 the company reevaluated its reporting unit structure and identified three reporting units 1 flavors 2 fragrance compounds and 3 fragrance ingredients prior to 2012 the company had identified two reporting units flavors and fragrances as a result in 2012 the company reallocated the goodwill previously allocated to its fragrances reporting unit to its fragrance compounds and fragrance ingredients reporting units 

the company performed the annual goodwill impairment test utilizing the twostep approach for the flavors fragrance compounds and fragrance ingredients reporting units by assessing the fair value of our reporting units based on discounted cash flows we completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of november 30 2014 which indicated no impairment of goodwill as the estimated fair values substantially exceeded the carrying values of each of these reporting units 

the analysis and evaluation of income taxes  we account for taxes under the asset and liability method under this method deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax return bases of assets and liabilities a valuation allowance is recognized if based on the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized the assessment of the need for a valuation allowance requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future earnings reversal of existing temporary differences and available tax planning strategies if actual experience differs from these estimates and assumptions the recorded deferred tax asset may not be fully realized resulting in an increase to income tax expense in our results of operations 

the company has not established deferred tax liabilities for undistributed foreign earnings as it has plans to and intends to indefinitely reinvest those earnings to finance foreign activities the unrecognized deferred tax liability on these undistributed earnings approximates 219 million  

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes we first determine whether it is “more likely than not” that we would sustain our tax position if the relevant tax authority were to audit the position with full knowledge of all the relevant facts and other information for those tax positions that meet this threshold we measure the amount of tax benefit based on the largest amount of tax benefit that we have a greater than 50 chance of realizing in a final settlement with the relevant authority those tax positions failing to qualify for initial recognition are recognized in the first interim period in which they meet the more likely than not standard this evaluation is made at the time that we adopt a tax position and whenever there is new information and is based upon management’s evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date we maintain a cumulative risk portfolio relating to all of our uncertainties in income taxes in order to perform this analysis but the evaluation of our tax positions requires significant judgment and estimation in part because in certain cases tax law is subject to varied interpretation and whether a tax position will ultimately be sustained 

may be uncertain we do not currently believe that any of our pending tax assessments even if ultimately resolved against us would have a material impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

the evaluation of potential litigation and environmental liabilities where changing circumstances rules and regulations require regular reassessment of related practices and anticipated costs  we are subject to certain legal claims regarding products and other matters as well as environmentalrelated matters significant management judgment is involved in determining when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the extent to which it can be reasonably estimated 

we regularly assess potential liabilities with respect to all legal claims based on the most recent available information in consultation with outside counsel we have engaged on our behalf to handle the defense of such matters to the extent a liability is considered to be probable and reasonably estimable we recognize a corresponding liability if the reasonably estimated liability is a range we recognize that amount considered most likely or in the absence of such a determination the minimum reasonably estimated liability to the extent such claims are covered by various insurance policies we separately evaluate the right to recovery and estimate the related insurance claim receivable management judgments involve determination as to whether a liability has been incurred the reasonably estimated amount of that liability and any potential insurance recovery 

we regularly evaluate potential environmental exposure in terms of total estimated cost and the viability of other potentially responsible parties “prp’s” associated with our exposure recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress and additional information becomes available critical management assumptions relate to expected total costs to remediate and the financial viability of prp’s to share such costs 

determination of the various assumptions employed in the valuation of pension and retiree health care expense and associated obligations  amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined from actuarial valuations inherent in such valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets discount rates at which the liabilities could be settled rates of increase in future compensation levels mortality rates and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore affect expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods 

we consider a number of factors in determining and selecting assumptions for the overall expected longterm rate of return on plan assets we consider the historical longterm return experience of our assets the current and expected allocation of our plan assets and expected longterm rates of return we derive these expected longterm rates of return with the assistance of our investment advisors we base our expected allocation of plan assets on a diversified portfolio consisting of domestic and international equity securities fixed income real estate and alternative asset classes 

we consider a variety of factors in determining and selecting our assumptions for the discount rate at december 31 for the us plans the discount rate was based on the internal rate of return for a portfolio of moody’s aaa aa and merrill lynch aaaaa high quality bonds with maturities that are consistent with the projected future benefit payment obligations of the plan the rate of compensation increase for all plans and the medical cost trend rate for the applicable us plans are based on plan experience 

with respect to the us plans the expected rate of return on plan assets was determined based on an asset allocation model using the current target allocation real rates of return by asset class and an anticipated inflation rate the target asset allocation consists of approximately 40  in equity securities and 60  in fixed income securities the plan has achieved a compounded annual rate of return of 80 over the previous 20 years at december 31 2014  the actual asset allocation was 40  in equity securities 59  in fixed income securities and 1  in cash equivalents 

the expected rate of return for the nonus plans employs a similar set of criteria adapted for local investments inflation rates and in certain cases specific government requirements the target asset allocation for the nonus plans consists of approximately 40  – 60  in fixed income securities 20  – 40  in equity securities 5  – 20  in real estate and 5  – 10  in alternative investments at december 31 2014  the actual asset allocation was 62  in fixed income investments 26  in equity investments 7  in real estate investments 4  in alternative investments and 1  in cash and cash equivalents 

changes in pension and other postemployment benefits and associated expenses may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions the impact that a 025 decrease in the discount rate or a 1 change in the medical cost trend rate would have on our pension and other postemployment benefit expense as applicable is as follows 



the effect of a 1 increase in the medical cost trend rate would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and the annual postretirement expense by approximately 69 million  and 03 million  respectively a 1 decrease in the rate would decrease the obligation and expense by approximately 67 million  and 03 million  respectively 

the ongoing assessment of the valuation of inventory given the large number of natural ingredients employed the quality of which may be diminished over time  we hold a majority of our inventory as raw materials providing the greatest degree of flexibility in manufacture and use as of december 31 2014  we maintained 48  of our inventory as raw materials materials are evaluated based on shelf life known uses and anticipated demand based on forecasted customer order activity and changes in productsales mix management policy provides for an ongoing assessment of inventory with adjustments recorded when an item is deemed to be slow moving or obsolete 

we believe that we have considered relevant circumstances that we may be currently subject to and the financial statements accurately reflect our best estimate of the impact of these items in our results of operations financial condition and cash flows for the years presented we have discussed the decision process and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 

new accounting standards 

in march 2013 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued authoritative guidance clarifying the accounting for the release of cumulative translation adjustments into net income when a parent either sells a part or all of its investment in a foreign entity or no longer holds a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets that is a nonprofit activity or a business within a foreign entity the guidance was effective prospectively for reporting periods beginning after december 15 2013 the adoption of this statement did not have an impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in july 2013 the fasb issued authoritative guidance related to the financial statement presentation of unrecognized tax benefits this update clarifies that an unrecognized tax benefit or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit should be presented in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward except to the extent a net operating loss carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward is not available at the reporting date under the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction to settle any additional income taxes that would result from the disallowance of a tax position or the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction does not require the entity to use and the entity does not intend to use the deferred tax asset for such purpose in such situations the unrecognized tax benefit should be presented in the financial statements as a liability and should not be combined with deferred tax assets the guidance was effective prospectively for reporting periods beginning after december 15 2013 the adoption of this statement did not have a significant impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in may 2014 the fasb issued authoritative guidance to clarify the principles to be used to recognize revenue the guidance is applicable to all entities and is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15 2016 early adoption is not permitted the company is currently evaluating the impact that this new standard will have on its consolidated financial statements 

nongaap financial measures 

the company uses nongaap financial operating measures in this annual report including i local currency sales which eliminates the effects that result from translating its international sales in us dollars ii likeforlike sales which eliminated the effects of local currency and the strategic decision to exit certain low margin sales in 2013 iii adjusted operating profit and operating profit margin which excludes the operational improvement initiative and restructuring charges iv adjusted effective tax rate which excludes the sale of a nonoperating assets tax and litigation settlements restructuring charges and operational improvement initiative costs and v adjusted cash flows from operations which excludes the spanish tax payments made and the yearoveryear incremental pension contribution the company also provides the nongaap measures adjusted ebitda which excludes certain specified items and noncash items as set forth in the company’s debt 

agreements and net debt which is adjusted for deferred gain on interest rate swaps and cash and cash equivalents solely for the purpose of providing information regarding the companys compliance with debt covenants contained in its debt agreements 

we have included each of these nongaap measures in order to provide additional information regarding our underlying operating results and comparable yearoveryear performance such information is supplemental to information presented in accordance with gaap and is not intended to represent a presentation in accordance with gaap in discussing our historical and expected future results and financial condition we believe it is meaningful for investors to be made aware of and to be assisted in a better understanding of on a periodtoperiod comparable basis financial amounts both including and excluding these identified items as well as the impact of exchange rate fluctuations and the exit of certain low margin sales activities on operating results and financial condition we believe such additional nongaap information provides investors with an overall perspective of the periodtoperiod performance of our business in addition management internally reviews each of these nongaap measures to evaluate performance on a comparative periodtoperiod basis in terms of absolute performance trends and expected future performance with respect to our business a material limitation of these nongaap measures is that such measures do not reflect actual gaap amounts for example costs associated with operational improvements and restructuring activities involve actual cash outlays we compensate for such limitations by using these measures as one of several metrics including gaap measures these nongaap measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we operate on a global basis and are exposed to currency fluctuation related to the manufacture and sale of our products in currencies other than the us dollar the major foreign currencies involve the markets in the european union great britain mexico brazil china india indonesia australia and japan although all regions are subject to foreign currency fluctuations versus the us dollar we actively monitor our foreign currency exposures in all major markets in which we operate and employ a variety of techniques to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations including foreign currency hedging activities 

we have established a centralized reporting system to evaluate the effects of changes in interest rates currency exchange rates and other relevant market risks our risk management procedures include the monitoring of interest rate and foreign exchange exposures and hedge positions utilizing statistical analyses of cash flows market value and sensitivity analysis however the use of these techniques to quantify the market risk of such instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of their accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions for the year ended december 31 2014  the company’s exposure to market risk was estimated using sensitivity analyses which illustrate the change in the fair value of a derivative financial instrument assuming hypothetical changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts with the objective of reducing exposure to cash flow volatility associated with foreign currency receivables and payables and with anticipated purchases of certain raw materials used in operations these contracts the counterparties to which are major international financial institutions generally involve the exchange of one currency for a second currency at a future date and have maturities not exceeding twelve months the gain or loss on the hedging instrument and services is recorded in earnings at the same time as the transaction being hedged is recorded in earnings at december 31 2014  the company’s foreign currency exposures pertaining to derivative contracts exist with the euro japanese yen south african rand and chinese renminbi based on a hypothetical decrease or increase of 10 in the applicable balance sheet exchange rates primarily against the us dollar the estimated fair value of the company’s foreign currency forward contracts would increase or decrease by approximately 25 million however any change in the value of the contracts real or hypothetical would be significantly offset by a corresponding change in the value of the underlying hedged items 

we have also used nonus dollar borrowings and foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the foreign currency exposures of our net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries primarily in the european union based on a hypothetical decrease or increase of 10 in the value of the us dollar against the euro the estimated fair value of the company’s foreign currency forward contracts would change by approximately 4 million however any change in the value of the contracts real or hypothetical would be significantly offset by a corresponding change in the value of the underlying hedged items 

we use derivative instruments as part of our interest rate risk management strategy the derivative instruments used are comprised principally of fixed to variable rate interest rate swaps based on the libor plus an interest mark up the notional amount interest payment and maturity date of the swaps match the principal interest payment and maturity date of the related debt and the swaps are valued using observable benchmark rates based on a hypothetical decrease or increase of one percentage point in libor the estimated fair value of the company’s interest rate swaps would change by less than 10 million 

at december 31 2014  the fair value of our fixed rate debt was 1 billion based on a hypothetical decrease of 10 in interest rates the estimated fair value of the company’s fixed debt would increase by 8 million 

we purchase certain commodities such as natural gas electricity petroleum based products and certain crop related items we generally purchase these commodities based upon market prices that are established with the vendor as part of the purchase process in general we do not use commodity financial instruments to hedge commodity prices

business 

tableend

we create manufacture and supply flavors and fragrances for the food beverage personal care and household products industries either in the form of compounds or individual ingredients our flavors and fragrances compounds combine a large number of ingredients that are blended mixed or reacted together to produce proprietary formulas created by our perfumers and flavorists utilizing our capabilities in consumer insight research and product development “rd” and creative expertise we collaborate with our customers to drive consumer preference for our customers’ brands this collaboration in turn helps bolster our customers’ market share and grow equity in their brand portfolio 

the global market for flavors and fragrances has expanded consistently primarily as a result of an increase in demand for as well as an increase in the variety of consumer products containing flavors and fragrances the flavors and fragrances market is part of a larger market which supplies a variety of ingredients and components that consumer products companies utilize in their products the broader market includes large multinational companies and smaller regional and local participants which supply products such as seasonings texturizers spices enzymes certain food related commodities fortified products and cosmetic ingredients in 2013 we achieved sales of approximately 30 billion making us one of the top four companies in the global flavors and fragrances subsegment of the broader ingredients and compounds market within the flavors and fragrances subsegment of this broader market the top four companies comprise approximately twothirds of the total estimated sales we believe that our diversified business platform consisting of expansive geographic coverage a broad product portfolio and a global and regional customer base positions us to achieve longterm growth as the flavors and fragrances markets expand 

with operations in 31 different countries worldwide and approximately 6000 employees we collaborate with our customers to serve consumers in more than 100 countries we operate in two business segments flavors and fragrances with sales to customers in the four regions set forth below 

  



we have a strong commitment to emerging markets we believe that significant future growth for the flavors and fragrances industry and for our business will come from the emerging markets all markets except north america japan australia and western southern and northern europe over the past five years our local currency growth rate in emerging markets has significantly outpaced that of developed markets the emerging market local currency growth rate in 2013 was 10 we have had operations in some of the largest emerging markets for multiple decades as a result of these established operations sales in emerging markets represented 49 of 2013 sales up from 47 in 2012 as our customers in emerging markets grow their businesses they will have the ability to leverage our longstanding presence and our extensive market knowledge to help drive their brands in addition to the emerging markets we also have strong growth in the mature markets of western europe including france spain and germany 

we believe we have a diversified product portfolio that provides us with stability in challenging economic environments in 2013 our flavors business represented 48 of our sales while our fragrances business represented 52 of sales during 2013 our 25 largest customers accounted for 53 of our sales sales to our largest customer accounted for 12 11 and 11 of our sales in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively such sales were largely in our fragrances business

strategic priorities 

we are focused on generating sustainable profitable growth in our business and positioning our portfolio for longterm growth we believe that we can improve our longterm business performance and increase shareholder value by leveraging our geographic reach strengthening our innovation platform and maximizing our portfolio the key elements of these strategic priorities are the following 

 our product offerings 

flavors 

flavors are the key building blocks that impart taste in processed food and beverage products and as such play a significant role in determining consumer preference of the end products in which they are used while we are a global leader our flavors business is regional in nature with different formulas that reflect local taste and ingredients as a leading creator of flavor compounds we help our customers deliver on the promise of delicious and healthy foods and drinks that appeal to consumers our flavors compounds are ultimately used by our customers in four enduse categories 1 savory 2 beverages 3 sweet pharmaceutical and oral care “sweet” and 4 dairy we create our flavors in our regional creative and technical centers that allow us to satisfy local taste preferences while also helping to ensure regulatory compliance and production standards we also manufacture a limited amount of flavor ingredients for our use in developing flavor compounds 

 4 

 

we develop thousands of different flavors for our customers almost all of which are tailormade we continuously develop new formulas in order to meet changing consumer preferences and customer needs consumers especially those in developed markets such as the united states and western europe are increasingly seeking to focus on products which promote health and wellness they want food and beverage products that are both good for them and taste good our objective is to capture a significant share of this shift in consumer demand by capitalizing on the ability of our naturals and proprietary ingredients and flavor modulation technology to provide consumers with healthier solutions without changing the taste experience of the food or beverage for example we use flavor modulation technology in combination with our blend of natural sweeteners to produce flavors that allow enduse products to have reduced sugar content without affecting taste 

fragrances 

we are a global leader in the creation of fragrances our fragrances are a key component in the world’s finest perfumes and bestknown consumer brands including fine fragrance beauty care fabric care personal wash and home care products our fragrances business consists of fragrance compounds and fragrance ingredients 

 

our perfumers have access to our large portfolio of innovative ingredients to support their creativity which in turn provides our customers with a unique identity for their brands we also create innovative delivery systems including i our proprietary encapsulation technology which consists of individual fragrance droplets coated with a protective polymetric shell to deliver superior fragrance performance throughout a product’s lifecycle and ii our exclusive polymer delivery system polyiff which is a “solid fragrance” technology that allows us to add scent to functional or molded plastic 

we believe that our inhouse naturals facilities led by laboratoire monique rémy lmr in grasse france is the industry standard for quality natural materials offering decades of experience understanding natural products and perfecting the process of transforming naturals such as narcissus jasmine and blackcurrant bud into pure absolutes that retain the unique fragrance of their origin 

we also collaborate with some of the world’s leading art and fashion schools to tap into the creative minds of the future leaders of fashion and design we collaborate with writers artists filmmakers and scientists to expose our perfumers to new and constantly evolving creative territories 

core competencies 

we focus on five core competencies that we believe enable us to i successfully provide our customers with superior products ii drive productivity and efficiency gains and iii improve our margins and our cash flow in that regard we strive to 

 research and product development 

we consider our rd development infrastructure to be one of our key competencies and we focus and invest substantial resources in the research and development of new and innovative compounds formulas and technologies and the application of these to our customers’ products using the knowledge gained from our consumer insights program we strategically focus our resources around key rd platforms that address consumer needs or preferences or anticipate a future preference by aligning our resources around these platforms we ensure the proper support and focus for each program so that it can be further developed and eventually be accepted for commercial application 

we maintain five rd centers around the world where we employ scientists and application engineers to support i the discovery of new materials ii the development of new technologies such as our delivery systems iii the creation of new compounds and iv the enhancement of existing ingredients and compounds in our 22 creative centers around the world including our newest facilities in shanghai sao paulo moscow singapore mumbai delhi chengdu and beijing teams of flavorists and perfumers work with our customers’ product development groups to create the exact scent or taste they are seeking in 2013 we employed about 1200 people in research and product development activities we spent 260 million 234 million and 220 million or approximately 9 8 and 8 of sales in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively on rd activities 

our ingredients research program discovers molecules found in natural substances and creates new molecules that are subsequently tested for their fragrance or flavor value to broaden our offering of natural innovative and unique products we seek collaborations with research institutions and other companies throughout the world we have created a number of such collaborations for example our collaborations with evolva and amyris that strengthen and broaden the pipeline of new and innovative molecules that we intend to launch in the coming years to further strengthen and broaden our technology offerings and capabilities we acquired aromor in january 2014 to provide us with costeffective complex specialty ingredients 

the development of new and customized flavor and fragrance compounds is a complex process calling upon the combined knowledge of our scientists flavorists and perfumers scientists from various disciplines work in project teams with the flavorists and perfumers to develop flavor and fragrance compounds with consumer preferred performance characteristics the development of new flavor and fragrance compounds requires i indepth knowledge of the flavor and fragrance characteristics of the various ingredients we use ii an understanding of how the many ingredients in a consumer product interact and iii the creation of controlled release and delivery systems to enhance flavor and fragrance performance to facilitate this process in 2011 we formed a scientific advisory board comprised of five leading scientists that provide external perspectives and independent feedback on our rd initiatives 

development of new flavors and fragrances is driven by a variety of sources including requests from our customers who are in need of a specific flavor or fragrance for use in a new or modified consumer product or as a result of internal initiatives stemming from our consumer insights program our product development team works in partnership with our scientists and researchers to optimize the consumer appeal of the flavor or fragrance a collaborative process between our researchers our product development team and our customers then follows to perfect the flavor or fragrance so that it is ready to be included in the final consumer product 

in addition to creating new flavors and fragrances our researchers and product development teams advise customers on ways to improve their existing products by adjusting or substituting current ingredients with more readily accessible or less expensive materials or by modifying the current ingredients to produce an enhanced yield this often results in creating a better value proposition for our customers 

our flavor and fragrance formulas are treated as trade secrets and remain our proprietary asset our business is not materially dependent upon any individual patent trademark or license 

supply chain 

we have an integrated supply chain from raw material sourcing through manufacturing quality assurance regulatory compliance and distribution which permits us to provide our customers with consistent quality products on a timely and costeffective basis 

procurement  the ingredients that we use in our compounds are both natural and synthetic we purchase approximately 9000 different raw materials from about 2400 domestic and international suppliers approximately half of the materials we purchase are naturals or crop related items and the other half are synthetics and chemicals natural ingredients are derived from flowers fruits and other botanical products as well as from animal products they contain varying numbers of organic chemicals that are responsible for the fragrance or flavor of the natural product the natural products are purchased in processed or semiprocessed form some are used in compounds in the state in which they are purchased and others after further processing natural products together with various chemicals are also used as raw materials for the manufacture of synthetic ingredients by chemical processes our flavor products also include extracts and seasonings derived from various fruits vegetables nuts herbs and spices as well as microbiologicallyderived ingredients we manufacture most of our synthetic ingredients for use in our fragrance compounds as well as for sale to others 

while we purchase a diverse portfolio of raw materials about 80 of our spending is focused on approximately 800 materials which allows us to leverage our buying power with suppliers in order to ensure our supply of raw materials achieve favorable pricing and provide timely transparency regarding inflationary trends to our customers we continue to be focused on i implementing a forwardbuy strategy ii entering into supplier relationships to gain access to supplies that we do not have iii implementing indexed pricing iv reducing the complexity of our formulations and v evaluating whether it is more profitable to buy or make an ingredient we are also concentrating on local country sourcing with our own procurement professionals 

manufacturing and distribution  we have 29 manufacturing sites around the world that support more than 35000 products our major manufacturing facilities are located in the united states the netherlands spain great britain argentina brazil mexico australia china india japan and singapore our supply chain initiatives in developing markets are focused on 

increasing capacity and investments in key technologies while within our more mature markets we tend to focus on consolidation and cost optimization as well as implementing new technologies in addition to our own manufacturing facilities we develop relationships with third parties that permit us to expand the technologies capabilities and capacity that we can access to serve our customers 

based on the regional nature of the flavors business and the concerns regarding the transportability of raw materials we have established smaller manufacturing facilities in our local markets that are focused on local needs products within the fragrances business are typically composed of compounds that are more stable and more transportable around the world consequently we have fewer manufacturing facilities within our fragrances business which produce compounds and ingredients for global distribution 

  

in 2013 we continued to invest in our facilities in emerging markets by opening a new flavors facility in guangzhou china this facility is one of our largest and most technically advanced flavors facilities 

governmental regulation 

we develop produce and market our products in a number of jurisdictions throughout the world and are subject to federal regional and local legislation and regulations in each of the various countries our flavor and many of our fragrance products are intended for the food beverage and pharmaceutical industries which are subject to strict quality and regulatory standards as a result we are required to meet these strict standards which in recent years have become increasingly stringent 

in addition we are subject to various rules relating to health work safety and the environment at the local and international levels in the various countries in which we operate our manufacturing facilities throughout the world are subject to environmental standards relating to air emissions sewage discharges the use of hazardous materials waste disposal practices and cleanup of existing environmental contamination in recent years there has been a significant increase in the stringency of environmental regulation and enforcement of environmental standards and the costs of compliance have risen significantly we expect that the trend of increased regulation and disclosure will continue in the future 

our products and operations are subject to regulation by governmental agencies in each of the markets in which we operate these agencies include 1 the food and drug administration and equivalent international agencies that regulate the flavors and other ingredients in consumer products 2 the environmental protection agency and equivalent international agencies that regulate our fragrance compounds 3 the occupational safety and health administration and equivalent international agencies that regulate the working conditions in our manufacturing research laboratories and creative centers 4 local and international agencies that regulate trade and customs and 5 the drug enforcement administration and other local or international agencies that regulate controlled chemicals that we use in our operations we have seen an increase in registration and reporting requirements concerning the use of certain chemicals in a number of countries 

competition 

the flavors and fragrances market is part of a larger market which supplies a variety of ingredients and components that consumer products companies utilize in their products the broader market includes large multinational companies or smaller regional and local participants which supply products such as seasonings texturizers spices enzymes certain food related commodities fortified products and cosmetic ingredients 

the market for flavors and fragrances is highly competitive based on annual sales our main competitors consist of 1 the three other large global flavor and fragrance manufacturers givaudan firmenich and symrise 2 midsized companies 3 numerous small and local manufacturers with more limited research and development capabilities who focus on narrow market segments and local customers and 4 consumer product companies who may develop their own flavors or fragrances we together with the other top three companies represent approximately twothirds of the total estimated sales in the global flavors and fragrances subsegment of the broader market 

we believe that our ability to compete successfully in the flavors and fragrances market is based on 1 our understanding of consumers 2 innovation arising from the creative skills of our perfumers and flavorists and the technological advances resulting from our research and development activities 3 our ability to create products which are tailormade for our customers’ needs 4 developing strong customer intimacy and 5 driving efficiency in all that we do 

large multinational customers and increasingly midsized customers may limit the number of their suppliers placing some on “core lists” giving them priority for development and production of their new or modified products 

to compete more successfully in this environment we must make continued investments in customer relationships and tailor product research and development in order to anticipate customers’ needs provide effective service and secure and maintain inclusion on certain “core lists” 

employee relations 

at december 31 2013 we had approximately 6000 employees worldwide of whom approximately 1400 are employed in the united states we believe that relations with our employees are good

risk factors 

tableend

we routinely encounter and address risks in conducting our business some of these risks may cause our future results to be different  sometimes materially different  than we presently anticipate below are certain important operational and strategic risks that could adversely affect our business how we react to material future developments as well as how our competitors react to those developments could also affect our future results 

volatility and increases in the price of raw materials energy and transportation could harm our profits 

we use many different raw materials for our business including essential oils extracts and concentrates derived from fruits vegetables flowers woods and other botanicals animal products raw fruits organic chemicals and petroleumbased chemicals although raw material cost increases moderated in 2013 they remain at elevated levels historically we have experienced the greatest amount of price volatility in natural products that represent approximately half of our raw material purchases availability and pricing of these natural products such as citrus and vanilla can be impacted by crop size and quality weather alternative land use and other factors which we cannot control 

if we are unable to increase the prices to our customers of our fragrance or flavor products to cover raw material and other input cost increases or if we are unable to achieve cost savings to offset such cost increases we could fail to meet our cost expectations and our profits and operating results could be adversely affected increases in prices of our products to customers may lead to declines in volume and we may not be able to accurately predict the volume impact of price increases which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

similarly commodities and energy prices are subject to significant volatility caused by market fluctuations supply and demand currency fluctuations production and transportation disruptions and other world events as we source many of our raw materials globally to help ensure quality control if the cost of energy shipping or transportation increases and we are unable to pass along these costs to our customers our profit margins would be adversely affected furthermore increasing our prices to our customers could result in longterm sales declines or loss of market share if our customers find alternative suppliers or choose to reformulate their consumer products to use fewer ingredients which could have a longterm impact on our results of operations 

to mitigate our sourcing risk we maintain strategic stock levels for critical items however if we do not accurately estimate the amount of raw materials that will be used for the geographic region in which we will need these materials our margins could be adversely affected 

our international operations are subject to economic political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position 

we operate on a global basis with manufacturing and sales facilities in the united states europe africa the middle east latin america and greater asia during 2013 78 of our net sales were to customers outside the united states and we intend to continue expansion of our international operations as a result our business is increasingly exposed to risks inherent in international operations these risks which can vary substantially by market are described in many of the risk factors in this section and include the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these factors may increase in importance as we expand our operations in emerging markets as part of our growth strategy 

we have made investments in and are expanding our business into emerging markets and regions which exposes us to certain risks 

as part of our growth strategy we have increased our presence in emerging markets including greater asia by expanding our manufacturing presence sales organization and product offerings in these markets and we expect to continue to focus on expanding our business in these markets in addition to the currency and international operation risks described above our operations in these markets may be subject to a variety of other risks these risks include economies that include consumers with limited or fluctuating disposable income and discretionary spending on which the end users of our products depend weak legal systems which may affect our ability to enforce our intellectual property and contractual rights exchange controls unstable governments and privatization or other government actions affecting the flow of goods and currency in conducting our business we move products from one country to another and may provide services in one country from a subsidiary located in another country accordingly we are vulnerable to abrupt changes in customs and tax regimes that may have significant negative impacts on our financial condition and operating results 

the increase in demand for consumer products using flavors and fragrances has been driven by factors outside of our control and if these factors do not persist our future growth could be adversely affected 

demand for consumer products using flavors and fragrances has been stimulated and broadened by changing social habits and economic growth especially in emerging markets approximately 49 of our sales during 2013 were generated in emerging markets and we expect emerging markets to continue to significantly contribute to our future growth increasing consumer demand for products using flavors and fragrances is dependent on factors such as increases in personal income dualearner households teenage population leisure time health concerns and urbanization and by the continued growth in world’s population all of which are outside of our control changes in any number of external economic factors or changes in social or consumer preferences could materially adversely impact our results of operations accordingly our future growth will depend upon the continued economic growth and development of consumer spending on products for which we supply flavors and fragrances in these global markets 

the current volatility in the global economy may adversely affect consumer spending and may negatively impact our business and operating results 

our flavors and fragrances are components of a wide assortment of global consumer products throughout the world since mid2008 the global economy has experienced significant recessionary pressures and declines in consumer confidence and economic growth these conditions led to economic contractions in the developed economies and reduced growth rates in the emerging markets while some segments of the global economy appear to be recovering the ongoing fiscal debt crisis in europe and the austerity plans being adopted in many countries have and may in the near future increase unemployment and underemployment decrease salaries and wage rates increase energy prices and inflation or result in other marketwide cost pressures that will adversely affect demand for consumer products in both developed and emerging markets reduced consumer spending may cause changes in our customer orders including reduced demand for our flavors and fragrances increased pressure to reduce the price of our flavors and fragrances or order cancellations to the extent that the volatility in global economic conditions continues our sales profitability and overall operating results could be adversely affected 

we may not successfully develop and introduce new products that appeal to our customers or our customers may not accurately anticipate and respond to global consumer market trends 

our growth and performance largely depends on our ability to successfully develop and introduce new products and product improvements that appeal to our customers and ultimately to global consumers we must continually anticipate and react to in a timely and costefficient manner changes in consumer preferences and demands we cannot be certain that we will successfully achieve our innovation goals such as the development of new molecules delivery methods and other technologies we currently spend approximately 9 of our sales on research and development however such investments may only generate future revenues to the extent that we are able to successfully develop products that meet our customers’ specifications can be delivered at an acceptable price and are accepted by the targeted consumer market furthermore there may be significant lag times from the time we incur rd costs to the time that these rd costs may result in increased revenue consequently even when we “win” a project our ability to generate revenues as a result of these investments is subject to numerous economic and other risks that are outside of our control including delays by our customers in the launch of a new product poor performance of our thirdparty vendors insufficient resources allocated by our customers to promoting the new product anticipated sales by our customers not being realized or changes in market preferences or demands or disruptive innovations by our competitors 

if we are unable to maintain the integrity of our raw materials supply chain and finished goods it may result in regulatory noncompliance litigation costs and harm to our reputation all of which may adversely impact sales and our results of operations 

the manufacture and sale of our products are subject to various regulatory requirements in each of the countries in which our products are manufactured and sold in addition we are subject to product safety and compliance requirements established by the industry or similar oversight bodies we use a variety of strategies methodologies and tools to i identify current product standards ii assess relative risks in our supply chain that can impact product integrity iii monitor internal and external performance and iv test raw materials and finished goods to minimize the likelihood of product or process noncompliance 

gaps in our operational processes could adversely affect the quality of our finished products and result in a regulatory noncompliance event if a product noncompliance event were to go undetected it could subject us to customer claims recalls penalties litigation costs and settlements remediation costs or loss of sales as our flavors and fragrances are used as ingredients in many products meant for human consumption these consequences would be exacerbated if our customer did not identify the defect and there was a resulting impact at the consumer level such a result could lead to potentially large scale adverse publicity recalls and potential consumer litigation furthermore adverse publicity about our products including concerns about product safety or similar issues whether real or perceived could harm our reputation and result in an immediate adverse effect on our sales as well as require us to utilize significant resources to rebuild our reputation 

a disruption in operations or our supply chain could adversely affect our business and financial results 

as a company engaged in development manufacturing and distribution on a global scale we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities including industrial accidents environmental events strikes and other labor disputes disruptions in supply chain or information systems loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites product quality control safety licensing requirements and other regulatory issues as well as natural disasters and other external factors over which we have no control if any of these events were to occur it could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results in addition while we have manufacturing facilities throughout the world certain of our facilities are the sole manufacturer of a specific ingredient if the manufacture of that ingredient were disrupted the cost of relocating or replacing the production of an ingredient or reformulating a product may be substantial which could have an adverse effect on our operating results 

our performance may be adversely impacted if we are not successful in managing our inventory andor working capital balances 

we evaluate our inventory balances of materials based on shelf life known uses and anticipated demand based on forecasted customer order activity and changes in our productsales mix efficient inventory management is a key component of our business success and profitability to be successful we must maintain sufficient inventory levels and an appropriate productsales mix to meet our customers’ demands without allowing those levels to increase to such an extent that the costs associated with storing and holding other inventory adversely impact our financial results if our buying decisions do not accurately predict customer trends or our expectations about customer needs are inaccurate we may have to take unanticipated markdowns or impairment charges to dispose of the excess or obsolete inventory which also can adversely impact our financial results additionally we believe excess inventory levels of raw materials with a short shelf life in our manufacturing facilities subjects us to the risk of increased inventory shrinkage if we are not successful in managing our inventory balances and shrinkage our results from operations and cash flows from operations may be negatively affected 

we selectively participate in programs offered by certain of our global customers whereby we accelerate the receipt of cash by selling the selected accounts receivable positions with these customers on a nonrecourse basis at a discount to designated third party banks should we choose not to participate or if these programs were no longer available it could reduce our cash flow from operations in the period in which the arrangement ends 

our recent rationalization of our manufacturing facilities may not be as effective as we anticipate and we may fail to realize the expected cost savings and increased efficiencies 

as part of our strategy we seek to enhance our manufacturing efficiency and align our geographic manufacturing footprint with our expectations of future growth to operate more efficiently and control costs from time to time we execute rationalization activities which include manufacturing facility consolidations for example during 2013 we announced the closure of three different facilities and the relocation and consolidation of those operations into other facilities these activities may pose significant risks which could include 

 

 

 

 

 

furthermore our rationalization and consolidation actions may not be as effective as we anticipate and we may fail to realize the cost savings we expect from these actions actual charges costs and adjustments due to restructuring activities may vary materially from our estimates our ability to realize anticipated cost savings synergies and revenue enhancements may be affected by a number of factors including our ability to effectively reduce overhead rationalize manufacturing capacity synchronize information technology systems consolidate warehousing and distribution facilities and shift production to more efficient facilities our restructuring plans may require cash and noncash integration and implementation costs or charges in excess of budgeted amounts which could offset any such savings and other synergies and therefore could have an adverse effect on our margins 

we may not achieve expected efficiencies related to the proximity of our customers’ production facilities to our manufacturing facilities or with respect to existing or future production relocation plans 

as part of our strategy we have consolidated certain manufacturing facilities to enhance our manufacturing efficiency and align our geographic manufacturing footprint with our expectations of future growth many of our facilities are located in close proximity to our customers in order to minimize both our customers’ and our own costs however we may not have sufficient demand to utilize all of our production capacity and may be required to ship excess products to other regions in which we operate which will increase our costs and decrease our margins in addition our expected growth may not be realized which would result in excess capacity and reduced margins 

our foreign operations are subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar nonus antibribery regulations noncompliance with such regulations could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we are subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act or fcpa which generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or other benefits along with various other anticorruption laws in addition we have manufacturing operations in some jurisdictions which pose potentially elevated risks of fraud or corruption or increased risk of internal control issues as needed we conduct internal investigations control testing and compliance reviews to help ensure that we are in compliance with applicable anticorruption and similar laws and regulations we could be subject to inquiries or investigations by government and other regulatory bodies any determination that our operations or activities are not in compliance with the fcpa or similar international laws and regulations could expose us to significant fines penalties or other sanctions that may harm our business and reputation 

our ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights 

we rely on patents and trade secrets to protect our intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to protect our intellectual property rights we often rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary fragrance and flavor formulations as this does not require us to publicly file information regarding our intellectual property from time to time a third party may claim that we have infringed upon their intellectual property rights or a third party may infringe upon our intellectual property as a result of such third party claims we could incur significant costs in connection with legal actions to assert our intellectual property rights or to defend ourselves from assertions of invalidity infringement or misappropriation for those intellectual property rights that are protected by way of trade secrets this litigation could result in even higher costs and potentially the loss of certain rights as we would not have a perfected intellectual property right that precludes others from making using or selling our products or processes 

for intellectual property rights that we seek to protect through patents we cannot be certain that these rights if obtained will not later be opposed invalidated or circumvented in addition even if such rights are obtained in the united states the 

laws of some of the other countries in which our products are or may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states if other parties were to infringe on our intellectual property rights or if a third party successfully asserted that we had infringed on their intellectual property rights it could materially and adversely affect our future results of operations by i reducing the price that we could obtain in the marketplace for products which are based on such rights ii increasing the royalty or other fees that we may be required to pay in connection with such rights or iii limiting the volume if any of such products that we can sell 

our business is highly competitive and if we are unable to compete effectively our sales and results of operations will suffer 

the market for flavors and fragrances is highly competitive we face vigorous competition from companies throughout the world including multinational and specialized flavor and fragrance companies as well as consumer product companies who may develop their own flavors or fragrances some of our competitors specialize in one or more of our product segments while others participate in many of our product segments in addition some of our global competitors may have greater resources than we do or may have proprietary products that could permit them to respond to changing business and economic conditions more effectively than we can consolidation of our competitors may exacerbate these risks 

competition in our business is based on innovation product quality regulatory compliance pricing quality of our customer service the support provided by our marketing and application groups and our understanding of consumers it is difficult for us to predict the timing and scale of our competitors’ actions in these areas the discovery and development of new flavor and fragrance materials protection of the company’s intellectual property and development and retention of key employees are important issues in our ability to compete in our businesses increased competition by existing or future competitors including aggressive price competition could result in the potential loss of substantial sales or create the need for us to reduce prices or increase spending and this could have an impact on sales and profitability 

large multinational customers and increasingly midsized customers may limit the number of their suppliers giving those that remain on “core lists” priority for new or modified products to compete more successfully in this environment we must continue to make investments in customer relationships and tailor product research and development in order to anticipate customers’ needs provide effective service and secure and maintain inclusion on certain “core lists” if we are unable to do so it could adversely impact our future results of operations 

our success depends on attracting and retaining talented people within our business significant shortfalls in recruitment or retention could adversely affect our ability to compete and achieve our strategic goals 

attracting developing and retaining talented employees including our perfumers and flavorists is essential to the successful delivery of our products and success in the marketplace competition for these employees can be intense the ability to attract and retain talented employees is critical in the development of new products and technologies which is an integral component of our growth strategy however we may not be able to attract and retain such employees in the future if we experience significant shortfalls in recruitment or retention our ability to effectively compete with our competitors and to grow our business could be adversely affected 

our reliance on a limited base of suppliers may result in a disruption to our business 

for certain raw materials we rely on a limited number of suppliers and we may not have readily available alternatives if we are unable to maintain our supplier arrangements and relationships and are unable to obtain the quantity quality and price levels needed for our business or if any of our key suppliers becomes insolvent or experiences other financial distress we could experience disruptions in production and our financial results could be adversely affected 

our results may be negatively impacted by the outcome of uncertainties related to litigation 

we are involved in a number of legal claims and litigation including claims related to indirect taxes we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of such litigation in addition we cannot provide assurance that future events will not result in an increase in the number of claims or require an increase in the amount accrued for any such claims or require accrual for one or more claims that has not been previously accrued 

the level of returns on pension and postretirement plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used for valuation purposes could affect our earnings and cash flows in future periods changes in government regulations could also affect our pension and postretirement plan expenses and funding requirements 

the funding obligations for our pension plans are impacted by the performance of the financial markets particularly the equity markets and interest rates funding obligations are determined under government regulations and are measured each year based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date if the financial markets do not provide the longterm returns that are expected under the governmental funding calculations we could be required to make larger contributions the equity markets can be and recently have been very volatile and therefore our estimate of future contribution requirements can change dramatically in relatively short periods of time similarly changes in interest rates and legislation enacted by governmental authorities can impact the timing and amounts of contribution requirements an adverse change in the funded status of the plans could significantly increase our required contributions in the future and adversely impact our liquidity 

assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans are determined by us in consultation with outside consultants and advisors in the event that we determine that changes are warranted in the assumptions used such as the discount rate expected longterm rate of return on assets or expected health care costs our future pension and postretirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease due to changing market conditions or changes in the participant population the assumptions that we use may differ from actual results which could have a significant impact on our pension and postretirement liabilities and related costs and funding requirements 

impairment charges on our longlived assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

future events may occur that would adversely affect the reported value of our longlived assets and require impairment charges such events may include but are not limited to strategic decisions made in response to changes in economic and competitive conditions the impact of the economic environment on our sales and our relationship with significant customers or business partners or a sustained decline in our stock price we continue to evaluate the impact of economic and other developments on our business to assess whether impairment indicators are present accordingly we may perform impairment tests more frequently than annually required based on changes in the economic environment and other factors and these tests could result in impairment charges in the future 

our financial results may be adversely impacted by the failure to successfully execute acquisitions collaborations and joint ventures 

from time to time we may evaluate potential acquisitions collaborations or joint ventures that align with our strategic objectives the success of such activity depends in part upon our ability to identify suitable buyers or partners perform effective assessments prior to contract execution negotiate contract terms and if applicable obtain government approval these activities may present certain financial managerial and operational risks including diversion of management’s attention from existing core businesses difficulties integrating or separating businesses from existing operations including employee integration and challenges presented by acquisitions collaborations or joint ventures which may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made if the acquisitions collaborations or joint ventures are not successfully implemented or completed there could be a negative impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our results of operations may be negatively affected by the impact of currency fluctuation or devaluation in the international markets in which we operate 

we have significant operations outside the us the results of which are reported in the local currency and then translated into us dollars at applicable exchange rates the exchange rates between these currencies and the us dollar have fluctuated and will continue to do so in the future additionally volatility in currency exchange rates may adversely impact our financial condition or liquidity although we employ a variety of techniques to reduce the impact of exchange rate fluctuations including sourcing strategies and a limited number of foreign currency hedging activities we cannot guarantee that such hedging and risk management strategies will be effective and our results of operations could be adversely affected 

changes in our tax rates the adoption of new us or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our future results 

we are subject to taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in liabilities for uncertain tax positions cost of repatriations or changes in tax laws or their 

interpretation in addition the current administration and congress have announced proposals for new us tax legislation that if adopted could affect our tax rate any of these changes could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 

we are also subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and foreign tax authorities in those countries in which we operate 

we have and will continue to implement transfer pricing policies among our various operations located in different countries these transfer pricing policies are a significant component of the management of our operations across international boundaries and overall financial results many countries routinely examine transfer pricing policies of taxpayers subject to their jurisdiction challenge transfer pricing policies aggressively where there is potential noncompliance and impose significant interest charges and penalties where noncompliance is determined there can be no assurance that a governmental authority will not challenge these policies more aggressively in the future or if challenged that we will prevail we could suffer significant costs related to one or more challenges to our transfer pricing 

we may be subject to assessments or audits in the future in any of the countries in which we operate the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals and while we do not believe the results that follow would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition such results could have a material effect on our income tax provision net income or cash flows in the period or periods in which that determination is made 

our operations may be affected by greenhouse emissions and climate change and related regulations 

the availability of raw materials and energy supplies fluctuate in markets throughout the world climate change may also affect the availability and price of key raw materials including natural products used in the manufacture of our products in order to mitigate the risk of price increases and shortages our purchasers have developed various sourcing strategies including multiple suppliers inventory management systems various geographic suppliers and longterm agreements to mitigate risk 

in addition to market forces there are various regulatory efforts relating to climate change that may increase the cost of raw materials particularly energy used to operate our facilities that could materially impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

information technology system failures or disruptions or breaches of our network security may adversely affect our business interrupt our operations subject us to increased operating costs and expose us to litigation 

we have information technology systems that support our business processes including product formulas product development sales order processing production distribution finance and intracompany communications throughout the world these systems may be susceptible to outages due to fire floods power loss telecommunications failures natural disasters breakins and similar events effective response to such disruptions will require effort and diligence on the part of our thirdparty vendors and employees to avoid any adverse impact to our information technology systems in addition our systems and proprietary data stored electronically may be vulnerable to computer viruses cybercrime computer hacking and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering if such unauthorized use of our systems were to occur data related to our product formulas product development and other proprietary information could be compromised the occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our business interrupt our operations subject us to increased operating costs and expose us to litigation 

the potential government regulation of certain of our product development initiatives is uncertain and we may be subject to adverse consequences if we fail to comply with applicable regulations 

as part of our ingredients research program we seek to collaborate with research institutions and companies throughout the world including biotechnology companies however it is unclear whether any of our product developments will be classified as genetically modified food products subject to regulation as a biotechnology product the manufacture of biotechnology products is subject to applicable current good manufacturing practice cgmp regulations as prescribed by the food and drug administration and the applicable standards prescribed by european commission and the competent authorities of european union member states and to other rules and regulations prescribed by foreign regulatory authorities compliance with these regulations can be expensive and time consuming such regulation could also subject us to requirements for labeling and traceability which may cause our customers to avoid our affected products and seek our competitors’ products this may result in our inability to realize any benefit from our investment and have an adverse effect on our operating results

legal proceedings 

tableend

we are subject to various claims and legal actions in the ordinary course of our business 

tax claims 

we are currently involved in administrative and legal proceedings with the spanish tax authorities that challenge tax deductions taken in our spanish subsidiaries’ tax returns and allege claims of tax avoidance as a result of tax audits the spanish tax authorities imposed income tax assessments on our spanish subsidiaries for the 20022003 fiscal years in the aggregate amount of euro 224 million 286 million including aggregate estimated interest during 2007 we filed appeals against these income tax assessments and related capital tax and tax avoidance claims with the central economicadministrative tribunal “teac” in spain in early 2010 the teac affirmed these tax assessments and related claims and during 2010 we filed appeals for judicial review with the spanish national appellate court “appellate court” on february 7 2013 the appellate court upheld the teac’s ruling with respect to the 2003 tax assessment and the related tax avoidance claims we decided not to pursue the appeal process accordingly during the second quarter of 2013 we paid euro 177 million 233 million based on the exchange rate at the payment date in connection with the 2003 tax assessment and during the third quarter of 2013 we paid the remaining balance of euro 31 million 40 million based on the exchange rate at the payment date related to the 2003 tax assessment as a result of this payment the remaining aggregate assessment related to the 2002 fiscal year was euro 18 million 25 million as of december 31 2013  

on june 17 2013 the appellate court ruled against us on our appeal of the 2002 income tax assessment and related claims which we have also decided not to appeal however this case did not have a related tax exposure associated with it 

on august 1 2012 we reached an overall settlement with the spanish tax authorities regarding income tax deductions taken by our spanish subsidiaries for the 20042010 fiscal years which deductions were similar to those challenged in connection with the 20022003 audits during the fourth quarter of 2012 the company and the spanish tax authorities also entered into a multiyear agreement that established the tax basis for our activities in spain for 2012 through 2014 consistent with the key principles preliminarily agreed upon as part of the overall settlement the settlement agreement did not address the assessments for the 20022003 fiscal years as these were further along in the spanish judicial process the settlement agreement also did not address the 2011 fiscal year as the spanish subsidiaries’ 2011 income tax return was filed in july 2012 and had not yet been audited during the fourth quarter of 2013 we reached a settlement with the spanish tax authorities related to the 2011 fiscal year on a basis consistent with the overall settlement reached for the 20042010 fiscal years as discussed above accordingly during the fourth quarter we paid euro 39 million 52 million based on the exchange rate at the payment date and have no remaining assessment related to the 2011 fiscal year 

the spanish tax authorities have also alleged claims related to capital tax positions arising from the business structure adopted by our spanish subsidiaries the aggregate amount of these claims is euro 96 million 132 million including aggregate estimated interest through december 31 2013  our previous settlement in 2012 with the spanish tax authorities addressed only the income tax assessments and did not address the capital tax positions in connection with their ruling on our 2002 income tax assessment the appellate court rejected one of the two bases upon which we based our capital tax position during the fourth quarter the company was notified that the spanish high court of justice ruled against us in regards to the 2002 capital tax case as a result the company recorded a charge of euro 96 million 130 million or 91 million after tax included in selling and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31 2013 on january 22 2014 we filed an appeal in order to avoid future interest costs in the event our appeal is unsuccessful we paid 112 million representing the principal amount during the first quarter of 2014 such amount will be refundable if we prevail in our appeal 

we have also been a party to four dividend withholding tax controversies in spain in which the spanish tax authorities allege that our spanish subsidiaries underpaid withholding taxes during the 19952001 fiscal years in 2012 the spanish supreme court ruled against us in three of the four pending cases and issued judgments in an aggregate of euro 149 million 197 million including aggregate estimated interest based on these rulings we paid euro 98 million 128 million for these three cases during 2012 we expect to make payments of remaining amounts due of euro 45 million 61 million in the first quarter of 2014 which reflects revised estimated interest and currency rates through december 31 2013 the remaining dividend withholding tax case relating to an amount in controversy of euro 32 million 44 million including aggregate estimated interest through december 31 2013  is currently pending 

we do not currently believe that any of our pending tax assessments even if ultimately resolved against us would have a material impact on our financial condition 

environmental 

over the past 20 years various federal and state authorities and private parties have claimed that we are a potentially responsible party “prp” as a generator of waste materials for alleged pollution at a number of waste sites operated by third parties located principally in new jersey and have sought to recover costs incurred and to be incurred to clean up the sites 

we have been identified as a prp at nine facilities operated by third parties at which investigation andor remediation activities may be ongoing we analyze our potential liability on at least a quarterly basis we accrue for environmental liabilities when they are probable and estimable we estimate our share of the total future cost for these sites to be less than 5 million 

while joint and several liability is authorized under federal and state environmental laws we believe the amounts we have paid and anticipate paying in the future for cleanup costs and damages at all sites are not material and will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity this assessment is based upon among other things the involvement of other prps at most of the sites the status of the proceedings including various settlement agreements and consent decrees and the extended time period over which payments will likely be made there can be no assurance however that future events will not require us to materially increase the amounts we anticipate paying for cleanup costs and damages at these sites and that such increased amounts will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

other 

in march 2012 zoomessence inc filed a complaint against the company in the us district court of new jersey alleging trade secret misappropriation breach of contract and unjust enrichment in connection with certain spray dry technology disclosed to the company in connection with the claims zoomessence is seeking an injunction and monetary damages zoomessence initially sought a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction but the court denied these applications in an order entered on september 27 2013 finding that zoomessence had not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of its claims the court subsequently referred the matter to mediation however the private mediation session did not result in a resolution of the dispute the case is currently proceeding through general discovery with a trial on the merits anticipated in early 2015 the company denies the allegations and will vigorously defend its position in court at this preliminary stage of the litigation based on the information currently available to the company management does not believe that this matter represents a material loss contingency 

we are also a party to other litigation arising in the ordinary course of our business we do not expect the outcome of these cases singly or in the aggregate to have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition

overview 

we create manufacture and supply flavors and fragrances for the food beverage personal care and householdproducts industries either in the form of compounds or individual ingredients our flavors and fragrance compounds combine a large number of ingredients that are blended mixed or reacted together to produce proprietary formulas created by our perfumers and flavorists 

flavors are the key building blocks that impart taste in processed food and beverage products and as such play a significant role in determining consumer preference of the end products in which they are used while we are a global leader our flavors business is more regional in nature with different formulas that reflect local tastes and ingredients as a leading creator of flavors we help our customers deliver on the promise of delicious and healthy foods and drinks that appeal to consumers our flavors compounds are ultimately used by our customers in four enduse categories 1 savory 2 beverages 3 sweet pharmaceutical and oral care “sweet” and 4 dairy 

our fragrances are a key component in the world’s finest perfumes and bestknown consumer brands including beauty care fabric care personal wash and home care products our fragrance compounds are ultimately used by our customers in two broad categories 1 fine fragrance and beauty care and 2 functional fragrances which when combined we refer to as fragrance compounds in addition our fragrance ingredients are used internally and sold to third parties including customers and competitors for use in preparation of compounds 

development of new flavors and fragrance compounds is driven by a variety of sources including requests from our customers who are in need of a specific flavor or fragrance for use in a new or modified consumer product or as a result of internal initiatives stemming from our consumer insights program our product development team works in partnership with our scientists and researchers to optimize the consumer appeal of the flavor or fragrance it then becomes a collaborative process between our researchers our product development team and our customers to perfect the flavor or fragrance so that it is ready to be included in the final consumer product 

our 25 largest customers accounted for 53 of total sales in 2013  this percentage has remained fairly constant for several years a key factor for commercial success is inclusion on the strategic customers’ core supplier lists opening opportunities to win new business we are on the core supplier lists of a large majority of our global and strategic customers within fragrances and our global customers within flavors 

the flavors and fragrances market is part of a larger market which supplies a variety of ingredients and components that consumer products companies utilize in their products the broader market includes large multinational companies or smaller regional and local participants which supply products such as seasonings texturizers spices enzymes certain food related commodities fortified products and cosmetic ingredients the flavors and fragrances market is estimated to be approximately 18 billion however the exact size of the global market is not available due to fragmentation of data we together with the other top three companies are estimated to comprise approximately twothirds of the total estimated sales in the global flavors and fragrances subsegment of the broader market 

sales in 2013  grew 5  both on a reported basis and in local currency lc terms or 6  on a likeforlike basis excluding the effects of the exit of low margin sales activities as a result of our broad and diverse portfolio of enduse product categories and geographies and despite the market and macroeconomic challenges we faced flavors achieved lc growth of 4  for 2013  or 6  on a likeforlike basis fragrances achieved lc growth of 6  for 2013  resulting from fragrance compounds lc sales growth more than offsetting the lc sales decline in fragrance ingredients of 4  the decline in fragrance ingredients was a result of the internal transition of volume to fragrance compounds overall our 2013  results continued to be driven by our strong emerging market presence that represented 49 of total sales and experienced 10 lc growth in 2013  from a geographic perspective eame la and ga all delivered lc growth in 2013  led by la with 10 lc sales growth 

2013  sales by business unit 

  



  



financial performance overview 

reported sales for 2013  increased 5  yearoveryear as both flavors and fragrances benefited from new wins net of losses and price increases that offset volume declines in fragrance ingredients principally related to the transition of volume to fragrance compounds and volume declines on existing business in both flavors and fragrance compounds exchange rate variations were flat in yearoveryear sales the effect of exchange rates can vary by business and region depending upon the mix of sales by country as well as the relative percentage of local sales priced in us dollars versus local currencies lc sales growth of 5  or 6  on a likeforlike basis excluding the effects of the exit of low margin sales activities in flavors in 2013  was consistent with our longterm strategic target of 46 lc growth we saw good lc sales growth during each quarter of 2013  despite the impact of the exit of low margin sales activities in flavors that effectively ended in the first half of 2013 for 2014  we expect to see growth consistent with our longterm targets lc growth will also benefit by an additional 1 due to the inclusion of aromor in our results 

on a longterm basis we expect that sales growth for the industry will generally be in line with the underlying assumptions that support our longterm strategic goals albeit with some risk in the near term given the continuing global economic uncertainty we believe changing social habits resulting from increased disposable income improved focus on personal health and wellness awareness should help drive growth of our consumer product customers’ business 

gross margins increased 180  basis points bps yearoveryear as a result of modest declines in raw material costs mix enhancements including the impact of the exit of low margin sales activities in flavors internal improvements and ongoing cost reduction efforts while we saw modest declines in yearoveryear raw material costs during 2013 the absolute raw material price levels remain near historical highs we believe that input costs will be relatively benign in 2014 with increases expected in certain elements of the portfolio we intend to continue to pursue options to enable us to recover the doubledigit cost increases that we experienced during 20112012 and to improve our margins through operational performance and mix enhancement while we continue to target yearoveryear expansion in our gross margins we expect that the rate of improvement during 2014 will be substantially less given the strong improvement realized during 2013 included in 2013 is 67 million of noncash charges related to accelerated depreciation included in cost of goods sold of which 53 million is associated with the fragrance ingredients rationalization as discussed in note 2 of the consolidated financial statements and 14 million is associated with several locations in asia also included is a 23 million pretax charge associated with our operational improvement initiatives primarily related to the closing of a smaller facility in europe and certain manufacturing activities in asia while transferring production to larger facilities in each respective region during the fourth quarter of 2013 we completed the testing and startup process at our flavors compounding facility in china and began commercial production which has resulted in higher depreciation expense and other operating costs associated with the commercial startup 

operating profit increased 297 million  to 5163 million   175  of sales in 2013  compared to 4866 million   172  of sales in 2012  included in 2013 were operational improvement initiative costs of 37 million primarily related to closing a smaller facility in europe and certain manufacturing activities in asia while transferring production to larger facilities in each respective region and accelerated depreciation associated with several locations in asia as well as restructuring costs of 74 million related to the fragrance ingredients rationalization both of these are expected to contribute to yearoveryear profit improvement during 2014 in addition 2013 included a 130 million charge related to the spanish capital tax case excluding these charges adjusted operating profit was 5404 million 183 of sales as of december 31 2013 included in 2012 were restructuring charges of 17 million excluding these charges adjusted operating profit was 4883 million 173 of sales as of december 31 2012 the yearoveryear improvement reflects volume growth combined with gross margin expansion including the benefits of mix improvements manufacturing efficiency and slightly favorable raw material costs that collectively more than offset the effects of higher rd selling and administrative costs including higher incentive compensation expense 

we continued to execute against the strategic priorities identified during our in depth 2010 strategic assessment in particular ensuring that we have adequate resources and capabilities in place to support planned growth in emerging markets through investments and installing key technologies globally was the primary driver related to the 134 million   45  of sales of capital spending during 2013  in 2014  we again expect capital spending to be 45 of sales net of potential grants and other reimbursements from government authorities that we expect to receive as we continue to prioritize investments in emerging markets and flavors 

cash flows from operations were 4076 million  or 138  of sales in 2013  as compared to cash flows from operations of 3238 million  including an outflow of cash of 1055 million associated with the spanish tax settlement or 115  of sales during 2012  excluding an incremental pension contribution of 150 million yearoveryear and the total spanish tax payments of 325 million related to the 2003 and 2011 fiscal years made during 2013 adjusted cash flows from operations was 4551 million in 2013 excluding the spanish tax settlement from 2012 our adjusted cash flow from operations was 4293 million in 2012  representing an increase of 258 million in 2013 from 2012

fragrances business unit 

fragrances segment profit totaled 2384 million in 2012 165 of sales compared to 2266 million 157 of sales reported in 2011 the increase in profitability was driven by the improved category mix and pricing combined with ongoing cost discipline and other margin improvement initiatives including the strategic initiative that was announced in early 2012 that more than offset higher raw material costs

liquidity and capital resources 

cash and cash equivalents 

we had cash and cash equivalents of 4055 million  at december 31 2013  compared to 3244 million  at december 31 2012  of which 1866 million of the balance at december 31 2013  was held outside the united states cash balances held in foreign jurisdictions are in most circumstances available to be repatriated to the united states however they would be subject to united states federal income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits except for a deferred tax on a portion of the earnings from one of our chinese subsidiaries we have not provided us income tax expense on accumulated earnings of our foreign subsidiaries because we have the ability and plan to reinvest the undistributed earnings indefinitely 

effective utilization of the cash generated by our international operations is a critical component of our tax strategy strategic dividend repatriation from foreign subsidiaries creates us taxable income which enables us to realize us deferred tax assets the company regularly repatriates in the form of dividends from its nonus subsidiaries a portion of its current year earnings to fund financial obligations in the us these repatriations of current year earnings totaled 1280 million 976 million and 1195 million in 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively

working capital current assets less current liabilities totaled 10925 million  at yearend 2013  compared to 9428 million  at december 31 2012  this increase in working capital of 1497 million  primarily reflects strong cash flow generation combined with the repayment of our short term debt d uring the year we selectively participate in programs offered by certain of our global customers when participating in these programs we accelerate the receipt of cash by selling the selected accounts receivable positions with these customers on a nonrecourse basis at a discount to designated third party banks the cost of participating in these programs was immaterial to our results in all periods 

as of december 31 2013  net trade receivables increased by 251 million  as compared to december 31 2012  principally related to higher sales levels during the fourth quarter 2013  versus the fourth quarter 2012

net investing activities in 2013  utilized 1054 million  compared to 1143 million  and 1312 million  in 2012  and 2011  respectively the improvement in the investing activities was principally driven by the proceeds from the sale of nonoperating assets

capital resources 

operating cash flow provides the primary source of funds for capital investment needs dividends paid to shareholders and debt repayments we anticipate that cash flows from operations and availability under our existing credit facilities are sufficient to meet our investing and financing needs for at least the next eighteen months we regularly assess our capital structure including both current and longterm debt instruments as compared to our cash generation and investment needs in order to provide ample flexibility and to optimize our leverage ratios we believe our existing cash balances are sufficient to meet our debt service requirements

other borrower under the new facility the new facility will mature on november 9 2016 but may be extended for up to two additional oneyear periods at the company’s request subject to the agreement of the lenders having commitments representing more than 50 of the aggregate commitments of all lenders under the new facility borrowings under the new facility bear interest at an annual rate of libor plus a margin currently 125 bps linked to our credit rating the interest rate under the new facility at december 31 2012 and 2011 was 141 and 177 respectively the new facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants including the requirement for us to maintain at the end of each fiscal quarter a ratio of net debt for borrowed money to adjusted ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization in respect of the previous 12month period of not more than 325 to 1 

under the new facility we are required to maintain at the end of each fiscal quarter a ratio of net debt for borrowed money to adjusted ebitda in respect of the previous 12month period of not more than 325 to 1 based on this ratio at december 31 2013  our covenant compliance would provide overall borrowing capacity of 15062 million 

as of december 31 2013  we had no borrowings under the new facility the amount which we are able to draw down on under the agreement is limited by financial covenants as described in more detail below our drawdown capacity on the new facility was 9495 million  at december 31 2013  

at december 31 2013  and 2012  we were in compliance with all financial and other covenants including the net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio at december 31 2013  our net debtadjusted ebitda 1 ratio was 083 to 1 as defined by the new facility well below the financial covenants of existing outstanding debt failure to comply with the financial and other covenants under our debt agreements would constitute default and would allow the lenders to accelerate the maturity of all indebtedness under the related agreement if such acceleration were to occur we would not have sufficient liquidity available to repay the indebtedness we would likely have to seek amendments under the agreements for relief from the financial covenants or repay the debt with proceeds from the issuance of new debt or equity andor asset sales if necessary we may be unable to amend the agreements or raise sufficient capital to repay such obligations in the event the maturities are accelerated 

 

 

 

 

compliance with existing governmental requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment has not materially affected our operations earnings or competitive position in 2013  and 2012  we spent 17 million and 23 million on capital projects and 189 million and 161 million respectively in operating expenses and governmental charges for the purpose of complying with such regulations expenditures for these purposes will continue for the foreseeable future in addition we are party to a number of proceedings brought under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act or similar state statutes it is expected that the impact of any judgments in or voluntary settlements of such proceedings will not be material to our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

contractual obligations 

at december 31 2013  we had contractual payment obligations due within the time periods as specified in the following table 

  



 

 the table above does not include 216 million  of the total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions and approximately 23 million  of associated accrued interest due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential cash flows the company is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid 

critical accounting policies and use of estimates 

our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements as disclosed in note 1 the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and accompanying disclosures these estimates are based on management’s best judgment of current events and actions that we may undertake in the future actual results may ultimately differ from estimates 

those areas requiring the greatest degree of management judgment or deemed most critical to our financial reporting involve 

the periodic assessment of potential impairment of intangible assets acquired in business combinations  we currently have net intangible assets including goodwill of 6962 million  in assessing the potential for impairment of goodwill management uses the most current actual and forecasted operating data available and current market based assumptions in accordance with the criteria in asc 350 in 2012 the company reevaluated its reporting unit structure and identified three reporting units 1 flavors 2 fragrance compounds and 3 fragrance ingredients prior to 2012 the company had 

identified two reporting units flavors and fragrances as a result in 2012 the company reallocated the goodwill previously allocated to its fragrances reporting unit to its fragrance compounds and fragrance ingredients reporting units 

the company performed the annual goodwill impairment test utilizing the twostep approach for the flavors fragrance compounds and fragrance ingredients reporting units by assessing the fair value of our reporting units based on discounted cash flows we completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of november 30 2013 which indicated no impairment of goodwill as the estimated fair values substantially exceeded the carrying values of each of these reporting units 

the analysis and evaluation of income taxes  we account for taxes under the asset and liability method under this method deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax return bases of assets and liabilities a valuation allowance is recognized if based on the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized the assessment of the need for a valuation allowance requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future earnings reversal of existing temporary differences and available tax planning strategies if actual experience differs from these estimates and assumptions the recorded deferred tax asset may not be fully realized resulting in an increase to income tax expense in our results of operations 

except for a deferred tax on a portion of the earnings from one of our chinese subsidiaries the company has not established deferred tax liabilities for undistributed foreign earnings as it has plans to and intends to indefinitely reinvest those earnings to finance foreign activities 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes we first determine whether it is “more likely than not” that we would sustain our tax position if the relevant tax authority were to audit the position with full knowledge of all the relevant facts and other information for those tax positions that meet this threshold we measure the amount of tax benefit based on the largest amount of tax benefit that we have a greater than 50 chance of realizing in a final settlement with the relevant authority those tax positions failing to qualify for initial recognition are recognized in the first interim period in which they meet the more likely than not standard this evaluation is made at the time that we adopt a tax position and whenever there is new information and is based upon management’s evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date we maintain a cumulative risk portfolio relating to all of our uncertainties in income taxes in order to perform this analysis but the evaluation of our tax positions requires significant judgment and estimation in part because in certain cases tax law is subject to varied interpretation and whether a tax position will ultimately be sustained may be uncertain we do not currently believe that any of our pending tax assessments even if ultimately resolved against us would have a material impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

the evaluation of potential litigation and environmental liabilities where changing circumstances rules and regulations require regular reassessment of related practices and anticipated costs  we are subject to certain legal claims regarding products and other matters as well as environmentalrelated matters significant management judgment is involved in determining when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the extent to which it can be reasonably estimated 

we regularly assess potential liabilities with respect to all legal claims based on the most recent available information in consultation with outside counsel we have engaged on our behalf to handle the defense of such matters to the extent a liability is considered to be probable and reasonably estimable we recognize a corresponding liability if the reasonably estimated liability is a range we recognize that amount considered most likely or in the absence of such a determination the minimum reasonably estimated liability to the extent such claims are covered by various insurance policies we separately evaluate the right to recovery and estimate the related insurance claim receivable management judgments involve determination as to whether a liability has been incurred the reasonably estimated amount of that liability and any potential insurance recovery 

we regularly evaluate potential environmental exposure in terms of total estimated cost and the viability of other potentially responsible parties “prp’s” associated with our exposure recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress and additional information becomes available critical management assumptions relate to expected total costs to remediate and the financial viability of prp’s to share such costs 

determination of the various assumptions employed in the valuation of pension and retiree health care expense and associated obligations  amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined from actuarial valuations inherent in such valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets discount rates at which the liabilities could be settled rates of increase in future compensation levels mortality rates and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore affect expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods 

we consider a number of factors in determining and selecting assumptions for the overall expected longterm rate of return on plan assets we consider the historical longterm return experience of our assets the current and expected allocation of our plan assets and expected longterm rates of return we derive these expected longterm rates of return with the 

assistance of our investment advisors we base our expected allocation of plan assets on a diversified portfolio consisting of domestic and international equity securities fixed income real estate and alternative asset classes 

we consider a variety of factors in determining and selecting our assumptions for the discount rate at december 31 for the us plans the discount rate was based on the internal rate of return for a portfolio of moody’s aaa aa and merrill lynch aaaaa high quality bonds with maturities that are consistent with the projected future benefit payment obligations of the plan the rate of compensation increase for all plans and the medical cost trend rate for the applicable us plans are based on plan experience 

with respect to the us plans the expected rate of return on plan assets was determined based on an asset allocation model using the current target allocation real rates of return by asset class and an anticipated inflation rate the target asset allocation consists of approximately 50 in equity securities and 50 in fixed income securities the plan has achieved a compounded annual rate of return of 74 over the previous 20 years at december 31 2013  the actual asset allocation was 48  in equity securities 51  in fixed income securities and 1  in cash equivalents 

the expected rate of return for the nonus plans employs a similar set of criteria adapted for local investments inflation rates and in certain cases specific government requirements the target asset allocation for the nonus plans consists of approximately 5560 in fixed income securities 20 25 in equity securities 510 in real estate and 510 in alternative investments at december 31 2013  the actual asset allocation was 59 in fixed income investments 25 in equity investments 8 in real estate investments 6 in alternative investments and 2 in cash and cash equivalents 

changes in pension and other postemployment benefits and associated expenses may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions the impact that a 025 decrease in the discount rate or a 1 change in the medical cost trend rate would have on our pension and other postemployment benefit expense as applicable is as follows 



the effect of a 1 increase in the medical cost trend rate would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and the annual postretirement expense by approximately 61 million  and 03 million  respectively a 1 decrease in the rate would decrease the obligation and expense by approximately 61 million  and 03 million  respectively 

the ongoing assessment of the valuation of inventory given the large number of natural ingredients employed the quality of which may be diminished over time  we hold a majority of our inventory as raw materials providing the greatest degree of flexibility in manufacture and use as of december 31 2013  we maintained 47  of our inventory as raw materials materials are evaluated based on shelf life known uses and anticipated demand based on forecasted customer order activity and changes in productsales mix management policy provides for an ongoing assessment of inventory with adjustments recorded when an item is deemed to be slow moving or obsolete 

we believe that we have considered relevant circumstances that we may be currently subject to and the financial statements accurately reflect our best estimate of the impact of these items in our results of operations financial condition and cash flows for the years presented we have discussed the decision process and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 

new accounting standards 

in february 2013 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued authoritative guidance related to reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income “aoci” under the amendments in this update an entity is required to report in one place information about reclassifications out of aoci and to report changes in its aoci balances for significant items reclassified out of aoci to net income in their entirety in the same reporting period reporting is required about the effect of the reclassifications on the respective line items in the statement where net income or loss is presented for items that are not reclassified to net income or loss in their entirety in the same reporting period a cross reference to other disclosures currently required under gaap is required in the notes to the entity’s consolidated financial statements this guidance is effective prospectively for reporting periods beginning after december 15 2012 during the first quarter of 2013 the company adopted this guidance as disclosed in note 15 

in march 2013 the fasb issued authoritative guidance clarifying the accounting for the release of cumulative translation adjustment into net income when a parent either sells a part or all of its investment in a foreign entity or no longer holds a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets that is a nonprofit activity or a business within a foreign entity the guidance is effective prospectively for reporting periods beginning after december 15 2013 we do not anticipate that this adoption will have a significant impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in july 2013 the fasb issued authoritative guidance related to the financial statement presentation of unrecognized tax benefits this update clarifies that an unrecognized tax benefit or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit should be presented in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward except to the extent a net operating loss carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward is not available at the reporting date under the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction to settle any additional income taxes that would result from the disallowance of a tax position or the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction does not require the entity to use and the entity does not intend to use the deferred tax asset for such purpose in such situations the unrecognized tax benefit should be presented in the financial statements as a liability and should not be combined with deferred tax assets the guidance is effective prospectively for reporting periods beginning after december 15 2013 this adoption did not have a significant impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in july 2013 the fasb issued authoritative guidance that permits the fed funds effective swap rate to be used as an additional us benchmark interest rate for hedge accounting purposes under topic 815 in addition to interest rates on direct treasury obligations of the us government ust and the london interbank offered rate libor the update also allows the use of different benchmark rates for similar hedges the guidance is effective prospectively for qualifying new or redesignated hedging relationships entered into on or after july 17 2013 the initial adoption of this asu did not impact to the companys financial position results of operations or cash flows 

nongaap financial measures 

the company uses nongaap financial operating measures in this annual report including i local currency sales which eliminates the effects that result from translating its international sales in us dollars ii likeforlike sales which eliminates the effects of local currency and the strategic decision to exit certain low margin sales iii adjusted operating profit which excludes the operational improvement initiative and restructuring charges iv adjusted effective tax rate which excludes the sale of a nonoperating assets tax and litigation settlements restructuring charges and operational improvement initiative costs and v adjusted cash flows from operations which excludes the spanish tax payments made and the yearoveryear incremental pension contribution the company also provides the nongaap measures adjusted ebitda which excludes certain specified items and noncash items as set forth in the company’s debt agreements and net debt which is adjusted for deferred gain on interest rate swaps and cash and cash equivalents solely for the purpose of providing information regarding the companys compliance with debt covenants contained in its debt agreements 

we have included each of these nongaap measures in order to provide additional information regarding our underlying operating results and comparable yearoveryear performance such information is supplemental to information presented in accordance with gaap and is not intended to represent a presentation in accordance with gaap in discussing our historical and expected future results and financial condition we believe it is meaningful for investors to be made aware of and to be assisted in a better understanding of on a periodtoperiod comparable basis financial amounts both including and excluding these identified items as well as the impact of exchange rate fluctuations and the exit of certain low margin sales activities on operating results and financial condition we believe such additional nongaap information provides investors with an overall perspective of the periodtoperiod performance of our business in addition management internally reviews each of these nongaap measures to evaluate performance on a comparative periodtoperiod basis in terms of absolute performance trends and expected future performance with respect to our business a material limitation of these nongaap measures is that such measures do not reflect actual gaap amounts for example costs associated with operational improvements and restructuring activities involve actual cash outlays we compensate for such limitations by using these measures as one of several metrics 

including gaap measures these nongaap measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we operate on a global basis and are exposed to currency fluctuation related to the manufacture and sale of our products in currencies other than the us dollar the major foreign currencies involve the markets in the european union great britain mexico brazil china india indonesia australia and japan although all regions are subject to foreign currency fluctuations versus the us dollar we actively monitor our foreign currency exposures in all major markets in which we operate and employ a variety of techniques to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations including foreign currency hedging activities 

we have established a centralized reporting system to evaluate the effects of changes in interest rates currency exchange rates and other relevant market risks our risk management procedures include the monitoring of interest rate and foreign exchange exposures and hedge positions utilizing statistical analyses of cash flows market value and sensitivity analysis however the use of these techniques to quantify the market risk of such instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of their accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions for the year ended december 31 2013  the company’s exposure to market risk was estimated using sensitivity analyses which illustrate the change in the fair value of a derivative financial instrument assuming hypothetical changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts with the objective of reducing exposure to cash flow volatility associated with foreign currency receivables and payables and with anticipated purchases of certain raw materials used in operations these contracts the counterparties to which are major international financial institutions generally involve the exchange of one currency for a second currency at a future date and have maturities not exceeding twelve months the gain or loss on the hedging instrument and services is recorded in earnings at the same time as the transaction being hedged is recorded in earnings at december 31 2013  the company’s foreign currency exposures pertaining to derivative contracts exist with the euro japanese yen british pound and indonesia rupiah based on a hypothetical decrease or increase of 10 in the applicable balance sheet exchange rates primarily against the us dollar the estimated fair value of the company’s foreign currency forward contracts would increase or decrease by approximately 40 million however any change in the value of the contracts real or hypothetical would be significantly offset by a corresponding change in the value of the underlying hedged items 

we have also used nonus dollar borrowings and foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the foreign currency exposures of our net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries primarily in the european union based on a hypothetical decrease or increase of 10 in the value of the us dollar against the euro the estimated fair value of the company’s foreign currency forward contracts would change by approximately 6 million however any change in the value of the contracts real or hypothetical would be significantly offset by a corresponding change in the value of the underlying hedged items 

we use derivative instruments as part of our interest rate risk management strategy the derivative instruments used are comprised principally of fixed to variable rate interest rate swaps based on the libor plus an interest mark up the notional amount interest payment and maturity date of the swaps match the principal interest payment and maturity date of the related debt and the swaps are valued using observable benchmark rates based on a hypothetical decrease or increase of one percentage point in libor the estimated fair value of the company’s interest rate swaps would change by less than 11 million 

at december 31 2013  the fair value of our fixed rate debt was 10079 million based on a hypothetical decrease of 10 in interest rates the estimated fair value of the company’s fixed debt would increase by 11 million 

we purchase certain commodities such as natural gas electricity petroleum based products and certain crop related items we generally purchase these commodities based upon market prices that are established with the vendor as part of the purchase process in general we do not use commodity financial instruments to hedge commodity prices

 item 1 business tableend we create manufacture and supply flavors and fragrances for the food beverage personal care and household products industries either in the form of compounds or individual ingredients our flavors and fragrances compounds combine a large number of ingredients that are blended mixed or reacted together to produce proprietary formulas created by our perfumers and flavorists utilizing our capabilities in consumer insight in research and product development “rd” and in creative expertise we collaborate with our customers to drive consumer preference for our customers’ brands this collaboration in turn helps bolster our customers’ market share and grow equity in their brand portfolio 

the global market for flavors and fragrances has expanded consistently primarily as a result of an increase in demand for as well as an increase in the variety of consumer products containing flavors and fragrances the flavors and fragrances market is part of a larger market which supplies a variety of ingredients and components that consumer products companies utilize in their products the broader market includes large multinational companies and smaller regional and local participants which supply products such as seasonings texturizers spices enzymes certain food related commodities fortified products and cosmetic ingredients in 2012 we achieved sales of approximately 28 billion making us one of the top four companies in the global flavors and fragrances subsegment of the broader ingredients and compounds market within the flavors and fragrances subsegment of this broader market the top four companies comprise approximately twothirds of the total estimated sales we believe that our diversified business platform consisting of expansive geographic coverage a broad product portfolio and a global and regional customer base positions us to achieve longterm growth as the flavors and fragrances markets expand 

with operations in 32 different countries worldwide and approximately 5700 employees we collaborate with our customers to serve consumers in more than 100 countries we operate in two business segments flavors and fragrances with sales to customers in the four regions set forth below 

 

 we believe that significant future growth for the flavors and fragrances industry and for our business will come from the emerging markets which are all markets except north america japan australia and western southern and northern europe our focus on emerging markets reflects the fact that over the past five years our local currency growth rate in emerging markets has significantly outpaced that of developed markets the emerging market local currency growth rate in 2012 was 8 iff has a strong commitment to emerging markets we have had operations in some of the largest emerging markets for multiple decades such as india in which we began operations in 1931 as a result of these established operations sales in emerging markets represented 47 of 2012 sales up from 46 in 2011 as our customers in emerging markets grow their businesses they will have the ability to leverage our longstanding presence and our extensive market knowledge to help drive their brands 

in addition to our geographic diversity we believe we have a diversified product portfolio that helps to provide us stability in challenging economic environments in 2012 our flavors business represented 49 of our sales while our fragrances business represented 51 of sales during 2012 our 25 largest customers accounted for 53 of our sales sales to the largest customer accounted for 11 11 and 10 of our sales in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively these sales were largely in our fragrances business 

  

for financial information about our operating segments and the geographic areas in which we do business please see note 12 of our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

strategic priorities 

we are focused on generating sustainable profitable growth in our business and positioning our portfolio for longterm growth we believe we can improve our longterm business performance and increase shareholder value by leveraging our geographic reach strengthening our innovation platform and maximizing our portfolio the key elements of these strategic priorities are the following 

 

  

  

 our product offerings 

flavors 

flavors are the key building blocks that impart taste in processed food and beverage products and as such play a significant role in determining consumer preference of the end products in which they are used while we are a global leader our flavors business is regional in nature with different formulas that reflect local taste and ingredients as a leading creator of flavor compounds we help our customers deliver on the promise of delicious and healthy foods and drinks that appeal to consumers our flavors compounds are ultimately used by our customers in four enduse categories 1 savory 2 beverages 3 sweet pharmaceutical and oral care “sweet” and 4 dairy we create our flavors in our regional creative and technical centers that allow us to satisfy local taste preferences while helping to ensure regulatory compliance and production standards we also manufacture a limited amount of flavor ingredients for our use in developing flavor compounds 

  

  

  

  

 we develop thousands of different flavors for our customers most of which are tailormade and we continuously develop new formulas in order to meet changing consumer preferences and customer needs consumers especially those in developed markets such as the united states and western europe are increasingly seeking to focus on products which promote health and wellness they want food and beverage products that are good for them but which taste good our objective is to capture a significant share of this shift in consumer demand by capitalizing on the ability of our naturals and proprietary ingredients and taste modulation technology to provide consumers with healthier solutions without changing the taste experience of the food or beverage for example we are using sweetness modulation technology in combination with our blend of natural sweeteners to produce flavors that allow enduse products to have a reduced sugar content without affecting taste our sodium modulation technology which we began rolling out in 2012 reduces the salt content in consumer products while at the same time maximizing taste by enhancing the flavors of other ingredients 

we are also developing sophisticated flavor profiles in our culinessence™ program to bring authentic culinary flavors to our customers the success of our recent launches of new culinary chicken and beef flavors was a direct result of this program 

fragrances 

we are a global leader in the creation of fragrances our fragrances are a key component in the world’s finest perfumes and bestknown consumer brands including fine fragrance beauty care fabric care personal wash and home care products our fragrances business consists of fragrance compounds and fragrance ingredients 

 

  

  

  

   

 our perfumers have access to our large portfolio of innovative ingredients to support their creativity which in turn provides our customers with a unique identity for their brands we also create innovative delivery systems including our i proprietary encapsulation technology which consists of individual fragrance droplets which are coated with a protective polymetric shell to deliver superior fragrance performance throughout a product’s lifecycle and ii our exclusive polymer delivery system polyiff which is a “solid fragrance” technology that allows us to add scent to functional or molded plastic 

we believe that our inhouse naturals facilities led by laboratoire monique rémy lmr in grasse france is the industry standard for quality natural materials offering decades of experience understanding natural products and perfecting the process of transforming naturals such as narcissus jasmine and blackcurrant bud into pure absolutes that retain the unique fragrance of their origin 

we also collaborate with the leading art and fashion schools in the world to tap into the creative minds of the future leaders of fashion and design we collaborate with writers artists filmmakers and scientists to expose our perfumers to new and constantly evolving creative territories 

core competencies 

we focus on five core competencies that we believe enable us to i successfully provide our customers with superior products ii drive productivity and efficiency gains and iii improve our margins and our cash flow in that regard we strive to 

 

  

  

   

  

  

 research and product development 

we consider our research and product development infrastructure to be one of our key competencies and we focus and invest substantial resources in the research and development of new and innovative compounds formulas and technologies and the application of these to our customers’ products using the knowledge gained from our consumer insights program we strategically focus our resources around key research and development platforms that address consumer needs or preferences or anticipate a future preference by aligning our resources around these platforms each program is ensured the proper support and focus so that it can be further developed and eventually be accepted for commercial application 

we maintain four research and development centers around the world at which we employ scientists and application engineers to support i the discovery of new materials ii the development of new technologies such as our delivery systems iii the creation of new compounds and iv the enhancement of existing ingredients and compounds in our 22 creative centers around the world including our newest facilities in shanghai sao paulo mumbai moscow and delhi teams of flavorists and perfumers work with our customers’ product development groups to create the exact scent or taste they are seeking in 2012 we employed about 1150 people in research and product development activities we spent 234 million 220 million and 219 million or approximately 8 of our sales in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively on rd and product development activities 

our ingredients research program discovers molecules found in natural substances and creates new molecules that are subsequently tested for their fragrance or flavor value to broaden our offering of natural innovative and unique products we seek out collaborations with research institutions and other companies throughout the world we have created a number of such collaborations that strengthen and broaden the pipeline of new and innovative products we intend to launch in the coming years for example we are working with evolva a biotechnology firm on the development of a sustainable source for natural vanillin 

the development of new and customized flavor and fragrance products is a complex process calling upon the combined knowledge of our scientists flavorists and perfumers scientists from various disciplines work in project teams with the flavorists and perfumers to develop flavor and fragrance products with consumer preferred performance characteristics the development of new flavor and fragrance compounds requires i indepth knowledge of the flavor and fragrance characteristics of the various ingredients we use ii an understanding of how the many ingredients in a consumer product interact and iii the creation of controlled release and delivery systems to enhance flavor and fragrance performance to facilitate this process in 2011 we formed a scientific advisory board comprising five expert scientists that provides external perspectives and input on our research and development programs 

development of new flavors and fragrances is driven by a variety of sources including requests from our customers who are in need of a specific flavor or fragrance for use in a new or modified consumer product or as a result of internal initiatives stemming from our consumer insights program our product development team 

  

works in partnership with our scientists and researchers to optimize the consumer appeal of the flavor or fragrance it then becomes a collaborative process between our researchers our product development team and our customers to perfect the flavor or fragrance so that it is ready to be included in the final consumer product 

in addition to creating new flavors and fragrances our researchers and product development teams advise customers on ways to improve their existing products by adjusting or substituting current ingredients with more readily accessible or less expensive materials or modifying the current ingredients to produce an enhanced yield often this results in creating a better value proposition for the consumer 

our flavor and fragrance formulas are treated as trade secrets and remain our proprietary asset our business is not materially dependent upon any individual patent trademark or license 

supply chain 

we have an integrated supply chain from raw material sourcing through manufacturing quality assurance regulatory compliance and distribution which permits us to provide our customers with consistent quality products on a timely and costeffective basis 

procurement  the ingredients that we use in our compounds are both natural and synthetic we purchase approximately 9000 different raw materials from about 2200 domestic and international suppliers approximately half of the materials we purchase are naturals or crop related items and the other half are synthetics and chemicals natural ingredients are derived from flowers fruits and other botanical products as well as from animal products they contain varying numbers of organic chemicals which are responsible for the fragrance or flavor of the natural product the natural products are purchased in processed or semiprocessed form some are used in compounds in the state in which they are purchased and others after further processing natural products together with various chemicals are also used as raw materials for the manufacture of synthetic ingredients by chemical processes our flavor products also include extracts and seasonings derived from various fruits vegetables nuts herbs and spices as well as microbiologicallyderived ingredients we manufacture most of our synthetic ingredients for use in our fragrance compounds as well as for sale to others 

while we purchase a diverse portfolio of raw materials about 80 of our spending is focused on approximately 800 materials which allows us to leverage our buying power with suppliers in order to ensure our supply of raw materials achieve favorable pricing and provide timely transparency regarding inflationary trends to our customers we continue to be focused on i implementing a forward buy strategy ii entering into supplier relationships to gain access to supplies that we do not have iii implementing indexed pricing iv reducing the complexity of our formulations and v evaluating whether it is more profitable to buy or make an ingredient we are also concentrating on local country sourcing with our own procurement professionals 

manufacturing and distribution we have 29 manufacturing sites around the world that support more than 36000 products our major manufacturing facilities are located in the united states the netherlands spain great britain argentina brazil mexico australia china india indonesia japan and singapore our supply chain initiatives in developing markets are focused on increasing capacity and investments in key technologies while we focus on consolidation and cost optimization in mature markets in addition to our own manufacturing facilities we develop relationships with third parties that permit us to expand the technologies capabilities and capacity that we can access to serve our customers 

based on the regional nature of the flavors business and the concerns regarding the transportability of raw materials we have established smaller manufacturing facilities in our local markets that are focused on local needs products within the fragrances business are typically composed of compounds that are more stable and more transportable around the world consequently we have fewer manufacturing facilities within our fragrances business which produce compounds and ingredients for global distribution 

  

in 2012 we continued to invest in our facilities in emerging markets opening a new liquid flavors and fragrances manufacturing facility in singapore in the first half of 2013 we expect to open a new flavors facility in guangzhou china and to begin our first phase expansion in connection with our 50 million investment in our existing flavors facility in turkey 

governmental regulation 

we develop produce and market our products in a number of jurisdictions throughout the world and are subject to federal regional and local legislation and regulations in each of the various countries our flavor and many of our fragrance products are intended for the food beverage and pharmaceutical industries which are subject to strict quality and regulatory standards as a result we are required to meet these strict standards which in recent years have become increasingly stringent 

in addition we are subject to various rules relating to health work safety and environment at the local and international levels in the various countries in which we operate our manufacturing facilities throughout the world are subject to environmental standards relating to air emissions sewage discharges the use of hazardous materials waste disposal practices and cleanup of existing environmental contamination in recent years there has been a significant increase in the stringency of environmental regulation and enforcement of environmental standards and the costs of compliance have risen significantly we expect that the trend of increased regulation and disclosure will continue in the future 

our products and operations are subject to regulation by governmental agencies in each of the markets in which we operate these agencies include 1 the food and drug administration and equivalent international agencies that regulate the flavors and other ingredients in consumer products 2 the environmental protection agency and equivalent international agencies that regulate our fragrance compounds 3 the occupational safety and health administration and equivalent international agencies that regulate the working conditions in our manufacturing research laboratories and creative centers 4 local and international agencies that regulate trade and customs and 5 the drug enforcement administration and other local or international agencies that regulate controlled chemicals that we use in our operations we have seen an increase in registration and reporting requirements concerning the use of certain chemicals in a number of countries for example in the continuing implementation of the eu reach registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemical substances regulations we will be registering a number of chemical substances in advance of the next registration deadline of may 2013 

competition 

the flavors and fragrances market is part of a larger market which supplies a variety of ingredients and components that consumer products companies utilize in their products the broader market includes large multinational companies or smaller regional and local participants which supply products such as seasonings texturizers spices enzymes certain food related commodities fortified products and cosmetic ingredientswe together with the other top three companies represent approximately twothirds of the total estimated sales in the global flavors and fragrances subsegment of the broader market 

the market for flavors and fragrances is highly competitive based on annual sales our main competitors consist of 1 the three other large global flavor and fragrance manufacturers givaudan firmenich and symrise 2 midsized companies 3 numerous small and local manufacturers with more limited research and development capabilities who focus on narrow market segments and local customers and 4 consumer product companies who may develop their own flavors or fragrances we together with the other top three companies represent approximately twothirds of the total estimated sales in the global flavors and fragrances subsegment of the broader market 

we believe that our ability to compete successfully in the flavors and fragrances market is based on 1 our understanding of consumers 2 innovation arising from the creative skills of our perfumers and flavorists and 

  

the technological advances resulting from our research and development activities 3 our ability to develop products which are tailor made for our customers’ needs 4 the quality reliability and cost effectiveness of our products 5 the quality of our customer service 6 the support provided by our marketing and application groups and 7 an understanding of the regulatory requirements in the markets in which our customers operate 

large multinational customers and increasingly midsized customers may limit the number of their suppliers placing some on “core lists” giving them priority for development and production of their new or modified products to compete more successfully in this environment we must make continued investments in customer relationships and tailor product research and development in order to anticipate customers’ needs provide effective service and secure and maintain inclusion on certain “core lists” 

employee relations 

at december 31 2012 we had approximately 5700 employees worldwide of whom approximately 1400 are employed in the united states we believe that relations with our employees are good

 item 1a risk factors tableend we routinely encounter and address risks in conducting our business some of these risks may cause our future results to be different — sometimes materially different — than we presently anticipate below are certain important operational and strategic risks that could adversely affect our business how we react to material future developments as well as how our competitors react to those developments could also affect our future results 

volatility and increases in the price of raw materials energy and transportation could harm our profits 

we use many different raw materials for our business including essential oils extracts and concentrates derived from fruits vegetables flowers woods and other botanicals animal products raw fruits organic chemicals and petroleumbased chemicals although raw materials cost increases moderated in 2012 they remain at elevated levels historically we have experienced the greatest amount of price volatility in natural products that represent approximately half of our raw material purchases availability and pricing of these natural products such as citrus and vanilla can be impacted by crop size and quality weather alternative land use and other factors which we cannot control 

if we are unable to increase the prices to our customers of our fragrance or flavor products to cover raw material and other input cost increases or if we are unable to achieve cost savings to offset such cost increases we could fail to meet our cost expectations and our profits and operating results could be adversely affected increases in prices of our products to customers may lead to declines in volume and we may not be able to accurately predict the volume impact of price increases which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

similarly commodities and energy prices are subject to significant volatility caused by market fluctuations supply and demand currency fluctuation production and transportation disruption and other world events as we source many of our raw materials globally to help ensure quality control if the cost of energy shipping andor transportation increases and we are unable to pass along these costs to our customers our profit margins would be adversely affected furthermore increasing our prices to our customers could result in longterm sales declines or loss of market share if our customers find alternative suppliers or choose to reformulate their consumer products to use fewer ingredients which could have a longterm impact on our results of operations 

to mitigate our sourcing risk we maintain strategic stock levels for critical items however if we do not accurately estimate the amount of raw materials that will be used for the geographic region in which we will need these materials our margins could be adversely affected 

the current volatility in the global economy may adversely affect consumer spending and may negatively impact our business and operating results 

our flavors and fragrances are components of a wide assortment of global consumer products throughout the world since mid2008 the global economy has experienced significant recessionary pressures and declines in consumer confidence and economic growth these conditions led to economic contractions in the developed economies and reduced growth rates in the emerging markets while some segments of the global economy appear to be recovering the ongoing fiscal debt crisis in europe and the austerity plans being adopted in many countries have and may in the near future increase unemployment and underemployment decrease salaries and wage rates increase energy prices and inflation or result in other marketwide cost pressures that will adversely affect demand for consumer products in both developed and emerging markets reduced consumer spending may cause changes in our customer orders including reduced demand for our flavors and fragrances increased 

  

pressure to reduce the price of our flavors and fragrances andor order cancellations to the extent that the volatility in global economic conditions continue our sales profitability and overall operating results could be adversely affected 

we may not successfully develop and introduce new products that appeal to our customers or our customers may not accurately anticipate and respond to global consumer market trends 

our growth and performance largely depends on our ability to successfully develop and introduce new products and product improvements that appeal to our customers and ultimately to global consumers we must continually anticipate and react to in a timely and costefficient manner changes in consumer preferences and demands we cannot be certain that we will successfully achieve our innovation goals such as the development of new molecules delivery methods and other technologies we currently spend approximately 8 of our sales on research and development however such investments may only generate future revenues to the extent that we are able to successfully develop products that meet our customers’ specifications that can be delivered at an acceptable price and that are accepted by the targeted consumer market furthermore there may be significant lag times from the time we incur rd costs to the time that these rd costs may result in increased revenue consequently even when we have “won” a project our ability to generate revenues as a result of these investments is subject to numerous economic and other risks that are outside of our control including delays by our customers in the launch of a new product poor performance of our thirdparty vendors insufficient resources allocated by our customers to promoting the new product anticipated sales by our customers not being realized or changes in market preferences or demands andor disruptive innovations by our competitors 

failure to maintain the integrity of our raw materials supply chain and finished goods may result in regulatory noncompliance litigation costs and harm to our reputation all of which may adversely impact sales and our results of operations 

the manufacture and sale of our products are subject to various regulatory requirements in each of the countries in which our products are manufactured and sold in addition we are subject to product safety and compliance requirements established by the industry or similar oversight bodies we use a variety of strategies methodologies and tools to i identify current product standards ii assess relative risks in our supply chain that can impact product integrity iii monitor internal and external performance and iv test raw materials and finished goods to minimize the likelihood of product or process noncompliance 

gaps in our operational processes could adversely affect the quality of our finished products and result in a regulatory noncompliance event if a product noncompliance event were to go undetected it could subject us to customer claims recalls penalties litigation costs andor settlements remediation costs or loss of sales as our flavors and fragrances are used as ingredients in many products meant for human consumption these consequences would be exacerbated if our customer did not identify the defect and there was a resulting impact at the consumer level such a result could lead to potentially large scale adverse publicity recalls and potential consumer litigation furthermore adverse publicity about our products including concerns about product safety or similar issues whether real or perceived could harm our reputation and result in an immediate adverse effect on our sales as well as require us to utilize significant resources to rebuild our reputation 

a disruption in operations or our supply chain could adversely affect our business and financial results 

as a company engaged in development manufacturing and distribution on a global scale we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities including industrial accidents environmental events strikes and other labor disputes disruptions in supply chain or information systems loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites product quality control safety licensing requirements and other regulatory issues as well as natural disasters and other external factors over which we have no control if any of these events were to occur it could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results in addition while we have manufacturing facilities throughout the world certain of our facilities are the sole manufacturer of a specific ingredient if the manufacture of that ingredient were disrupted the cost of relocating or replacing the production of an ingredient or reformulating a product may be substantial which could have an adverse effect on our operating results 

  

the increase in demand for consumer products using flavors and fragrances has been driven by factors outside of our control and if these factors do not persist our future growth could be adversely affected 

demand for consumer products using flavors and fragrances has been stimulated and broadened by changing social habits and economic growth especially in emerging markets approximately 47 of our sales during 2012 were generated in emerging markets and we expect emerging markets to continue to significantly contribute to our future growth increasing consumer demand for products using flavors and fragrances is dependent on factors such as increases in personal income dualearner households teenage population leisure time health concerns and urbanization and by the continued growth in world population all of which are outside of our control changes in any number of external economic factors or changes in social or consumer preferences could materially adversely impact our results of operations accordingly our future growth will depend upon the continued economic growth and development of consumer spending on products for which we supply the flavor or fragrance in these global markets 

our international operations are subject to economic political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position 

we operate on a global basis with manufacturing and sales facilities in the united states europe africa and the middle east latin america and greater asia during 2012 77 of our net sales were to customers outside the united states and we intend to continue expansion of our international operations as a result our business is increasingly exposed to risks inherent in international operations these risks which can vary substantially by market are described in many of the risk factors in this section and include the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 these factors may increase in importance as we expand our operations in emerging markets as part of our growth strategy 

  

our foreign operations are subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar nonus antibribery regulations noncompliance with such regulations could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we are subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act or fcpa which generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business andor other benefits along with various other anticorruption laws in addition we have manufacturing operations in some jurisdictions which pose potentially elevated risks of fraud or corruption or increased risk of internal control issues as needed we conduct internal investigations control testing and compliance reviews to help ensure that we are in compliance with applicable anticorruption and similar laws and regulations we could be subject to inquiries or investigations by government and other regulatory bodies any determination that our operations or activities are not in compliance with the fcpa or similar international laws and regulations could expose us to significant fines penalties or other sanctions that may harm our business and reputation 

our ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights 

we rely on patents and trade secrets to protect our intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to protect our intellectual property rights we often rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary fragrance and flavor formulations as this does not require us to publicly file information regarding our intellectual property from time to time a third party may claim that we have infringed upon their intellectual property rights or a third party may infringe upon our intellectual property as a result of such third party claims we could incur significant costs in connection with legal actions to assert our intellectual property rights or to defend ourselves from assertions of invalidity infringement or misappropriation for those intellectual property rights that are protected by way of trade secrets this litigation could result in even higher costs and potentially the loss of certain rights as we would not have a perfected intellectual property right that precludes others from making using or selling our products or processes 

for intellectual property rights that we seek to protect through patents we cannot be certain that these rights if obtained will not later be opposed invalidated or circumvented in addition even if such rights are obtained in the united states the laws of some of the other countries in which our products are or may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states if other parties were to infringe on our intellectual property rights or if a third party successfully asserted that we had infringed on their intellectual property rights it could materially and adversely affect our future results of operations by i reducing the price that we could obtain in the marketplace for products which are based on such rights ii increasing the royalty or other fees that we may be required to pay in connection with such rights or iii limiting the volume if any of such products that we can sell 

our business is highly competitive and if we are unable to compete effectively our sales and results of operations will suffer 

the market for flavors and fragrances is highly competitive we face vigorous competition from companies throughout the world including multinational and specialized flavor and fragrance companies as well as consumer product companies who may develop their own flavors or fragrances some of our competitors specialize in one or more of our product segments while others participate in many of our product segments in addition some of our global competitors may have greater resources than we do or may have proprietary products that could permit them to respond to changing business and economic conditions more effectively than we can consolidation of our competitors may exacerbate these risks 

competition in our business is based on innovation product quality regulatory compliance pricing quality of our customer service the support provided by our marketing and application groups and our understanding of consumers it is difficult for us to predict the timing and scale of our competitors’ actions in these areas the discovery and development of new flavor and fragrance materials protection of the company’s intellectual property and development and retention of key employees are important issues in our ability to compete in our 

  

businesses increased competition by existing or future competitors including aggressive price competition could result in the potential loss of substantial sales or create the need for us to reduce prices or increase spending and this could have an impact on sales and profitability 

large multinational customers and increasingly midsized customers may limit the number of their suppliers giving those that remain on “core lists” priority for new or modified products to compete more successfully in this environment we must continue to make investments in customer relationships and tailor product research and development in order to anticipate customers’ needs provide effective service and secure and maintain inclusion on certain “core lists” if we are unable to do so it could adversely impact our future results of operations 

our success depends on attracting and retaining talented people within our business significant shortfalls in recruitment or retention could adversely affect our ability to compete and achieve our strategic goals 

attracting developing and retaining talented employees including our perfumers and flavorists is essential to the successful delivery of our products and success in the marketplace competition for these employees can be intense the ability to attract and retain talented employees is critical in the development of new products and technologies which is an integral component of our growth strategy however we may not be able to attract and retain such employees in the future if we experience significant shortfalls in recruitment or retention our ability to effectively compete with our competitors and to grow our business could be adversely affected 

our reliance on a limited base of suppliers may result in a disruption to our business 

for certain raw materials we rely on a limited number of suppliers and we may not have readily available alternatives if we are unable to maintain our supplier arrangements and relationships and are unable to obtain the quantity quality and price levels needed for our business or if any of our key suppliers becomes insolvent or experiences other financial distress we could experience disruptions in production and our financial results could be adversely affected 

our results may be negatively impacted by the outcome of uncertainties related to litigation 

we are involved in a number of legal claims and litigation including claims related to indirect taxes we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of such litigation in addition we cannot provide assurance that future events will not result in an increase in the number of claims or require an increase in the amount accrued for any such claims or require accrual for one or more claims that has not been previously accrued 

our future success depends on our ability to achieve our longterm strategy 

achieving our longterm objectives will require investment in product innovation and expanding our presence in emerging markets these investments may result in shortterm costs without any current revenues and therefore may be dilutive to our earnings at least in the short term 

on october 26 2012 we announced plans to invest over 50 million in an existing flavors facility in gebze turkey over the next three years additionally we opened a new stateoftheart liquid flavors and fragrances manufacturing plant in jurong singapore and expect to open our new flavors facility in guangzhou china in the first half of 2013 as part of our further investment in greater asia these significant investments in creative and manufacturing capabilities in emerging markets could help us gain share in the fastgrowing developing markets of europe the middle east africa and asia if we are unable to gain share in these developing markets it is unlikely that we will be able to achieve our longterm strategy furthermore unanticipated costs and construction delays could increase our operating costs and affect our financial results 

in addition as part of our strategy to maximize the economic profitability of our product portfolio we may employ various strategies including increasing pricing implementing cost reduction or containment measures or 

  

phasing out low margin products we may not realize in full or in part the anticipated benefits of our strategy and we may incur costs or special charges related to our strategy the failure to realize benefits which may be due to our inability to execute plans global or local economic conditions competition changes in our industry and the other risks described herein could have a material adverse effect on our business 

the level of returns on pension and postretirement plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used for valuation purposes could affect our earnings and cash flows in future periods changes in government regulations could also affect our pension and postretirement plan expenses and funding requirements 

the funding obligations for our pension plans are impacted by the performance of the financial markets particularly the equity markets and interest rates funding obligations are determined under government regulations and are measured each year based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date if the financial markets do not provide the longterm returns that are expected under the governmental funding calculations we could be required to make larger contributions the equity markets can be and recently have been very volatile and therefore our estimate of future contribution requirements can change dramatically in relatively short periods of time similarly changes in interest rates and legislation enacted by governmental authorities can impact the timing and amounts of contribution requirements an adverse change in the funded status of the plans could significantly increase our required contributions in the future and adversely impact our liquidity 

assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans are determined by us in consultation with outside consultants and advisors in the event that we determine that changes are warranted in the assumptions used such as the discount rate expected longterm rate of return on assets or expected health care costs our future pension and postretirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease due to changing market conditions or changes in the participant population the assumptions that we use may differ from actual results which could have a significant impact on our pension and postretirement liabilities and related costs and funding requirements 

impairment charges on our longlived assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

future events may occur that would adversely affect the reported value of our longlived assets and require impairment charges such events may include but are not limited to strategic decisions made in response to changes in economic and competitive conditions the impact of the economic environment on our sales and our relationship with significant customers or business partners or a sustained decline in our stock price we continue to evaluate the impact of economic and other developments on our business to assess whether impairment indicators are present accordingly we may perform impairment tests more frequently than annually required based on changes in the economic environment and other factors and these tests could result in impairment charges in the future 

our financial results may be adversely impacted by the failure to successfully execute acquisitions collaborations and joint ventures 

from time to time we may evaluate potential acquisitions collaborations or joint ventures that align with our strategic objectives the success of such activity depends in part upon our ability to identify suitable buyers or partners perform effective assessments prior to contract execution negotiate contract terms and if applicable obtain government approval these activities may present certain financial managerial and operational risks including diversion of management’s attention from existing core businesses difficulties integrating or separating businesses from existing operations including employee integration and challenges presented by acquisitions collaborations or joint ventures which may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made if the acquisitions collaborations or joint ventures are not successfully implemented or completed there could be a negative impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

  

our results of operations may be negatively affected by the impact of currency fluctuation or devaluation in the international markets in which we operate 

we have significant operations outside the us the results of which are reported in the local currency and then translated into us dollars at applicable exchange rates the exchange rates between these currencies and the us dollar have fluctuated and will continue to do so in the future additionally volatility in currency exchange rates may adversely impact our financial condition or liquidity although we employ a variety of techniques to reduce the impact of exchange rate fluctuations including sourcing strategies and a limited number of foreign currency hedging activities we cannot guarantee that such hedging and risk management strategies will be effective and our results of operations could be adversely affected 

changes in our tax rates the adoption of new us or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our future results 

we are subject to taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in liabilities for uncertain tax positions cost of repatriations or changes in tax laws or their interpretation in addition the current administration and congress have announced proposals for new us tax legislation that if adopted could adversely affect our tax rate any of these changes could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 

we are also subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and foreign tax authorities in those countries in which we operate in particular in the third quarter of 2012 we reached an overall settlement with the spanish tax authorities regarding income tax deductions taken by our spanish subsidiaries for the 20042010 fiscal years we are currently involved in tax disputes with the spanish tax authorities regarding certain tax positions taken in our spanish subsidiaries’ tax returns in years other than those covered by the settlement and anticipate that we may receive additional assessments for these pending matters 

we may be subject to assessments andor audits in the future in any of the countries in which we operate the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals and while we do not believe the results that follow would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition such results could have a material effect on our income tax provision net income or cash flows in the period or periods in which that determination is made 

our operations may be affected by greenhouse emissions and climate change and related regulations 

the availability of raw materials and energy supplies fluctuate in markets throughout the world climate change may also affect the availability and price of key raw materials including natural products used in the manufacture of our products in order to mitigate the risk of price increases and shortages our purchasers have developed various sourcing strategies including multiple suppliers inventory management systems various geographic suppliers and longterm agreements to mitigate risk 

in addition to market forces there are various regulatory efforts relating to climate change that may increase the cost of raw materials particularly energy used to operate our facilities that could materially impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

information technology system failures or disruptions or breaches of our network security may interrupt our operations subject us to increased operating costs and expose us to litigation 

we have information technology systems that support our business processes including product formulas product development sales order processing production distribution finance and intracompany communications throughout the world these systems may be susceptible to outages due to fire floods power loss telecommunications failures natural disasters breakins and similar events for example in october 2012 

  

several of our locations in the northeast united states were impacted by hurricane sandy resulting in interruptions to our operations and information technology system infrastructure our information technology systems remain vulnerable to interruptions from similar such disasters in the future effective response to future disasters will require effort and diligence on the part of our thirdparty vendors and employees to avoid any adverse impact to our information technology systems in addition our systems may be vulnerable to computer viruses computer hacking and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering the occurrence of any of these events could interrupt our operations subject us to increased operating costs and expose us to litigation

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend we are subject to various claims and legal actions in the ordinary course of our business 

tax claims 

we are currently involved in administrative and legal proceedings with the spanish tax authorities that challenge tax deductions taken in our spanish subsidiaries’ tax returns and allege claims of tax avoidance as a result of tax audits the spanish tax authorities imposed income tax assessments on our spanish subsidiaries for the 20022003 fiscal years in the aggregate amount of euro 222 million 293 million including aggregate estimated interest through december 31 2012 during 2007 we filed appeals against these income tax assessments and related capital tax and tax avoidance claims with the central economicadministrative tribunal “teac” in spain in early 2010 the teac affirmed these tax assessments and related claims and during 2010 we filed appeals for judicial review with the spanish national appellate court “appellate court” on february 7 2013 the appellate court upheld the teac’s ruling with respect to the 2003 tax assessment and the 

  

related tax avoidance claims we have filed a notice of intent to appeal this ruling the appellate court has not yet ruled on our appeal of the 2002 tax assessment and related claims 

on august 1 2012 we reached an overall settlement with the spanish tax authorities regarding income tax deductions taken by our spanish subsidiaries for the 20042010 fiscal years which deductions were similar to those challenged in connection with the 20022003 audits during the fourth quarter the company and the spanish tax authorities also entered into a multiyear agreement that established the tax basis for our activities in spain for 2012 through 2014 consistent with the key principles preliminarily agreed upon as part of the overall settlement the settlement agreement did not address the assessments for the 20022003 fiscal years as these were further along in the spanish judicial process the settlement agreement also did not address the 2011 fiscal year as the spanish subsidiaries’ 2011 income tax return was filed in july 2012 and has not yet been audited based on the settlement reached for the 20042010 fiscal years we expect that our spanish subsidiaries will receive an assessment for 2011 on a basis consistent with the 20042010 settlement 

the spanish tax authorities are also alleging claims related to capital tax positions arising from the business structure adopted by our spanish subsidiaries the aggregate amount of these claims is euro 93 million 123 million including aggregate estimated interest through december 31 2012 our settlement with the spanish tax authorities addressed only the income tax assessments and did not address the capital tax positions we intend to continue to defend these claims 

we have also been a party to four dividend withholding tax controversies in spain in which the spanish tax authorities allege that our spanish subsidiaries underpaid withholding taxes during the 19952001 fiscal years in 2012 the spanish supreme court ruled against us in three of the four pending cases and issued judgments in an aggregate of euro 149 million 197 million including aggregate estimated interest through december 31 2012 based on these rulings we paid euro 98 million 128 million for these three cases during 2012 the remaining dividend withholding tax case relating to an amount in controversy of euro 31 million 41 million including aggregate estimated interest through december 31 2012 is currently pending 

we do not currently believe that any of our pending tax assessments even if ultimately resolved against us would have a material impact on our financial condition 

environmental 

over the past 20 years various federal and state authorities and private parties have claimed that we are a potentially responsible party “prp” as a generator of waste materials for alleged pollution at a number of waste sites operated by third parties located principally in new jersey and have sought to recover costs incurred and to be incurred to clean up the sites 

we have been identified as a prp at nine facilities operated by third parties at which investigation andor remediation activities may be ongoing we analyze our potential liability on at least a quarterly basis we accrue for environmental liabilities when they are probable and estimable we estimate our share of the total future cost for these sites to be less than 5 million 

while joint and several liability is authorized under federal and state environmental laws we believe the amounts we have paid and anticipate paying in the future for cleanup costs and damages at all sites are not and will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity this assessment is based upon among other things the involvement of other prps at most of the sites the status of the proceedings including various settlement agreements and consent decrees and the extended time period over which payments will likely be made there can be no assurance however that future events will not require us to materially increase the amounts we anticipate paying for cleanup costs and damages at these sites and that such increased amounts will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

other 

we are also a party to other litigation arising in the ordinary course of our business we do not expect the outcome of these cases singly or in the aggregate to have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition

overview 

we create manufacture and supply flavors and fragrances for the food beverage personal care and householdproducts industries either in the form of compounds or individual ingredients our flavors and fragrance compounds combine a large number of ingredients that are blended mixed or reacted together to produce proprietary formulas created by our perfumers and flavorists 

flavors are the key building blocks that impart taste in processed food and beverage products and as such play a significant role in determining consumer preference of the end products in which they are used while we are a global leader our flavors business is more regional in nature with different formulas that reflect local tastes and ingredients as a leading creator of flavors we help our customers deliver on the promise of delicious and healthy foods and drinks that appeal to consumers our flavors compounds are ultimately used by our customers in four enduse categories 1 savory 2 beverages 3 sweet pharmaceutical and oral care “sweet” and 4 dairy 

our fragrances are a key component in the world’s finest perfumes and bestknown consumer brands including beauty care fabric care personal wash and home care products our fragrance compounds are ultimately used by our customers in two broad categories 1 fine fragrance and beauty care and 2 functional fragrances which when combined we refer to as fragrance compounds in addition our fragrance ingredients are used internally and sold to third parties including customers and competitors for use in preparation of compounds 

development of new flavors and fragrance compounds is driven by a variety of sources including requests from our customers who are in need of a specific flavor or fragrance for use in a new or modified consumer product or as a result of internal initiatives stemming from our consumer insights program our product development team works in partnership with our scientists and researchers to optimize the consumer appeal of the flavor or fragrance it then becomes a collaborative process between our researchers our product development team and our customers to perfect the flavor or fragrance so that it is ready to be included in the final consumer product 

our 25 largest customers accounted for 53 of total sales in 2012 this percentage has remained fairly constant for several years a key factor for commercial success is inclusion on the strategic customers’ core supplier lists opening opportunities to win new business we are on the core supplier lists of a large majority of our global and strategic customers within fragrances and our global customers within flavors 

the flavors and fragrances market is part of a larger market which supplies a variety of ingredients and components that consumer products companies utilize in their products the broader market includes large multinational companies or smaller regional and local participants which supply products such as seasonings texturizers spices enzymes certain food related commodities fortified products and cosmetic ingredients the flavors and fragrances market is estimated to be approximately 18 billion however the exact size of the global market is not available due to fragmentation of data we together with the other top three companies are estimated to comprise approximately twothirds of the total estimated sales in the global flavors and fragrances subsegment of the broader market 

sales in 2012 grew 1 on a reported basis and 4 in local currency lc terms or 5 on a likeforlike basis excluding the effects of the exit of low margin sales activities as a result of our broad and diverse portfolio of enduse product categories and geographies and despite the market and macroeconomic challenges we faced flavors achieved lc growth of 5 for 2012 or 8 on a likeforlike basis fragrances achieved lc growth of 

  

3 for 2012 resulting from fragrance compounds lc sales growth more than offsetting the lc sales decline in fragrance ingredients of 10 the decline in fragrance ingredients was a result of price driven volume declines principally related to commodity products the fourth quarter showed improvement in fragrance ingredients versus doubledigit declines during the first nine months of 2012 however we do not expect to continue to see this level of improvement going forward overall our 2012 results continued to be driven by our strong emerging market presence that represented 47 of total sales and experienced 8 lc growth in 2012 from a geographic perspective all four regions delivered lc growth in 2012 led by la with 12 lc sales growth 

2012 sales by business unit 

 

 

  

 financial performance overview 

reported sales for 2012 increased 1 yearoveryear as both flavors and fragrances benefited from new wins net of losses and price increases that offset price driven volume declines in fragrance ingredients principally related to commodity products and volume declines on existing business in both flavors and fragrance compounds exchange rate variations represented a 3 decrease in yearoveryear sales the effect of exchange rates can vary by business and region depending upon the mix of sales by country as well as the relative percentage of local sales priced in us dollars versus local currencies lc sales growth of 4 or 5 on a likeforlike basis excluding the effects of the exit of low margin sales activities in flavors in 2012 was consistent with our longterm strategic target of 46 lc growth we saw sequential improvement in lc sales growth during each quarter of 2012 despite an increasing impact of the exit of low margin sales activities in flavors during the year we expect that the negative impact on lc sales growth from the current initiative to exit low margin sales activities will effectively end at the end of the first half of 2013 for 2013 we believe that lc growth including the negative impact from the exit of low margin sales activities will be at the lower end of our longterm financial targets reflecting continued volatility in macroeconomic and uncertain fiscal conditions in key markets along with continued pressure in the commodity components of our fragrance ingredients business 

  

on a longterm basis we expect that sales growth for the industry will generally be in line with the underlying assumptions that support our longterm strategic goals albeit with some risk in the near term given the continuing global economic uncertainty we believe changing social habits resulting from increased disposable income improved focus on personal health and wellness awareness should help drive growth of our consumer product customers’ business especially in the emerging markets we have targeted such as india china indonesia and brazil 

gross margins increased 210 basis points bps yearoveryear as a result of price realization moderating increases in input costs improved manufacturing leverage mix improvements including the impact of the exit of low margin sales activities in flavors and ongoing cost reduction efforts while we have begun to realize slight declines in yearoveryear raw material costs late in 2012 raw material costs remain at elevated levels we intend to continue to pursue options to enable us to recover the cost increases that we have experienced during 20112012 and to improve our margins through operational performance and mix enhancement we expect to continue to see yearoveryear gross margin expansion in 2013 as we fully benefit from the actions taken in 2012 combined with a benign raw material cost environment 

operating profit increased 589 million to 4866 million 172 of sales in 2012 compared to 4277 million 153 of sales in 2011 we were able to help compensate for the significant input cost pressure and higher incentive compensation through price increases maintaining a strict cost discipline exiting certain low margin sales activities within flavors and executing against our strategy to improve our portfolio through innovation 

in december 2011 we recorded a charge to cover a restructuring which involved a reduction in workforce across fragrances flavors and corporate functions as well as a realignment of responsibilities in our fragrances business unit the savings generated will principally benefit the functional fragrance activities within the company this category was one of the improvement opportunities identified during our 2010 strategic assessment process 

despite the nearterm challenges we faced during 2012 we continued to execute against the strategic priorities identified during our 2010 assessment in particular ensuring that we have adequate resources and capabilities in place to support planned growth in emerging markets through investments and key technologies was the primary driver within the 126 million 45 of sales of capital spending during 2012 in 2013 we again expect capital spending to approach 5 as we continue to prioritize investments in emerging markets and flavors 

cash flows from operations were 3238 million or 115 of sales in 2012 including an outflow of cash of 1055 million associated with the spanish tax settlement as compared to cash flows from operations of 1892 million including a 40 million cash outflow related to a patent litigation settlement or 68 of sales during 2011 excluding the spanish tax and patent litigation settlements from each period our adjusted cash flow from operations nearly doubled to 4293 million in 2012 from 2292 million in 2011 

  

results of operations 

 

 cost of goods sold includes the cost of materials and manufacturing expenses raw materials generally constitute 700 of the total rd expenses relate to the development of new and improved products technical product support and compliance with governmental regulations sa expenses include expenses necessary to support our commercial activities and administrative expenses principally associated with staff groups that support our overall operating activities 

2012 in comparison to 2011 

sales 

sales for 2012 totaled 28 billion an increase of 1 from the prior year excluding currency impacts lc sales grew by 4 or 5 on a likeforlike basis excluding the effects of the exit of low margin sales activities in flavors driven principally by new wins and the realization of price increases lc sales growth was largely driven by new customer wins with price offset by volume reductions on existing business primarily in fragrance ingredients 

flavors business unit 

on a reported basis flavors sales increased 2 excluding the impact of foreign currency lc sales for the flavors business increased 5 versus the prior year period excluding the impact of a 3 decline in sales associated with the strategic decision to exit certain lower margin sales activities lc sales increased 8 on a likeforlike basis the increase was driven by new wins and the realization of price increases lc growth was led by doubledigit gains in beverages and singledigit gains in dairy and savory all of which benefited from new wins supported by our innovative technology and price increases that have compensated for volume 

  

declines regionally the business benefited from high singledigit lc growth in ga and singledigit lc growth in noam eame and la lc growth in ga reflects growth in all categories led by high singledigit gains in savory sweet and dairy overall likeforlike sales growth was stable with mid to high singledigit growth in each quarter of 2012 sales in noam were led by doubledigit gains in beverages the improvement in eame reflects high singledigit gains in savory and mid singledigit gains in beverages eame performance continues to be led by our performance in the emerging market countries within the region la lc growth of 4 was driven by mid singledigit gains in beverages and savory and doubledigit gains in dairy globally flavors growth was led by high singledigit growth in emerging markets overall emerging markets represented approximately 49 of total flavors sales 

fragrances business unit 

the fragrances business remained flat in reported sales and was up 3 in lc terms compared to a 1 lc sales decrease in 2011 over 2010 new wins and the realization of price increases across fragrance compounds were partially offset by volume declines in existing business most notably in fragrance ingredients principally related to commodity products however we saw an improvement in fragrance ingredients growth during the fourth quarter driven by shortterm customer order patterns yearoveryear 2012 lc sales performance was led by high singledigit growth in fabric care and beauty care categories along with mid singledigit gains in personal wash and fine fragrance fragrance compounds sales improved in each quarter of 2012 offsetting these gains was a 10 decline in fragrance ingredients lc growth within the regions was led by la at 15 reflecting doubledigit gains in all fine and beauty care categories and doubledigit and high singledigit gains in the functional fragrance categories which was partially offset by declines in fragrance ingredients of approximately 8 noam and ga experienced sales growth of 2 and 1 respectively reflecting midtohigh singledigit gains in fine fragrance fabric care and personal wash categories and doubledigit growth in noam hair care which were partially offset by volume declines in fragrance ingredients eame sales decreased slightly reflecting doubledigit gains in fabric care and singledigit gains in personal wash that were more than offset by doubledigit volume declines in fragrance ingredients emerging markets accounted for all of the growth on a global basis overall emerging markets represented 46 of total fragrances sales 

sales performance by region and category 

 

  

  

   

  

  

  

 cost of goods sold 

cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales decreased 210 bps to 583 in 2012 compared to 604 in 2011 the improvement versus last year was mainly driven by price realization manufacturing efficiencies and favorable sales mix that more than offset higher raw material costs overall raw material costs have increased approximately 4 on a yearoveryear basis late in the fourth quarter we began to see slight yearoveryear declines in raw material costs we expect to see further declines in 2013 albeit minor in value 

research and development rd 

rd expenses increased approximately 139 million versus the prior year as a result of additional investments in technology and innovation consistent with our strategy to accelerate levels of innovation into the marketplace our product portfolio is actively managed to support gross margin expansion and growth initiatives in advantaged categories while improving margins in less advantaged categories which included exiting lower margin sales activities overall rd expenses increased 40 bps as a percentage of sales from 79 in 2011 to 83 in 2012 

selling and administrative sa 

sa as a percentage of sales increased 20 bps to 161 versus 159 the 2011 amount includes 335 million related to the mane patent litigation settlement excluding this amount our adjusted sa in 2011 would have been 147 of sales the increase in sa expenses was driven by planned spend in sales activities mainly in emerging markets higher incentive compensation and pension expenses and provision adjustments for allowance for doubtful accounts 

  

restructuring and other charges 

restructuring and other charges primarily consist of separation costs for employees including severance outplacement and other benefit costs 

 

 strategic initiative 

in december 2011 we recorded a charge to cover a restructuring which involved a reduction in workforce as well as a realignment of responsibilities in our fragrances business unit this alignment partly addresses issues identified in our 2010 strategic review process towards improving the underperforming areas of our portfolio it resulted in the redeployment of creative resources in emerging markets and the reorganization from a regional to a global category structure we implemented a plan to streamline business operations globally which resulted in the elimination of 72 positions across fragrances flavors and corporate functions as a result we recorded a provision for severance costs of 98 million to restructuring and other charges we recorded an additional net charge of 17 million during the twelve months ended december 31 2012 principally attributable to adjustments based on the final separation terms with affected employees we realized pretax savings of approximately 8 million in 2012 

european rationalization plan 

during the second quarter 2011 we executed a partial settlement of our pension obligations with the former employees of the drogheda ireland facility as a result we recorded a charge of 39 million related to the european rationalization plan to cover settlements and special termination benefits this settlement was funded primarily through pension plan investment trust assets 

we also reversed 12 million of employeerelated liabilities in 2011 due to certain employees accepting other roles within the company offset by 06 million of additional costs incurred 

based upon the periodend estimates regarding the separation agreements we increased our provision for severance costs in by 44 million in 2010 the remaining 57 million of the restructuring charges in 2010 was mainly due to accelerated depreciation and other restructuring related costs pertaining to the rationalization of our fragrances and ingredients operations in europe 

in the aggregate as of december 31 2012 we have recorded expenses of 341 million relating to the european rationalization plan and 115 million for the strategic initiative of which 393 million was recorded to restructuring and other charges net and 63 million was recorded to cost of goods sold rd and selling and administrative expenses we do not anticipate any further expenses related to the european rationalization plan 

  

operating results by business unit

 flavors business unit 

flavors segment profit totaled 2983 million in 2012 216 of sales compared to 2842 million 211 of sales in the comparable 2011 period the improvement in profitability was mainly driven by strong sales performance favorable category mix and the realization of price increases that more than offset higher raw material costs and ongoing investments in rd 

fragrances business unit 

fragrances segment profit totaled 2384 million in 2012 165 of sales compared to 2266 million 157 of sales reported in 2011 the increase in profitability was driven by the improved category mix and pricing combined with ongoing cost discipline and other margin improvement initiatives including the strategic initiative that was announced in early 2012 that more than offset higher raw material costs 

global expenses 

global expenses represent corporate and headquartersrelated expenses which include legal finance human resources and rd and other administrative expenses that are not allocated to an individual business unit in 2012 global expenses were 484 million compared to 364 million during 2011 the increase principally includes higher incentive compensation and pension costs 

interest expense 

in 2012 interest expense decreased 29 million to 418 million the decrease in interest expense reflects lower levels of outstanding debt average cost of debt was 46 for the 2012 period compared to 47 in 2011 

other expense net 

other expense net decreased approximately 81 million to 15 million in 2012 versus 95 million in 2011 the improvement was largely driven by favorable realized and unrealized foreign exchange lossesgains on working capital balances 

  

income taxes 

the effective tax rate was 427 in 2012 as compared to 286 in 2011 included in 2012 results are tax charges of 724 million associated with the spanish tax settlement and pretax restructuring charges of 17 million 11 million aftertax excluding these items the adjusted effective tax rate for 2012 was 264 the 2011 period included 335 million of pretax expense related to the patent litigation settlement and pretax restructuring charges of 132 million excluding these items and 73 million of associated tax benefits the adjusted effective tax rate for 2011 was 271 the reduction of the adjusted effective tax rate in 2012 versus the prior year period reflects a lower cost of repatriation a 106 million benefit related to the corporate restructuring of certain of our foreign subsidiaries and the absence of a writeoff in 2011 of deferred tax assets in the us associated with state law changes partially offset by approximately 120 million of charges related to the spanish dividend withholding cases and the absence of the us rd tax credit in 2012 

2011 in comparison to 2010 

sales 

sales for 2011 totaled 28 billion an increase of 6 from the prior year excluding currency impacts lc sales grew by 4 driven principally by new business and the realization of price increases that were implemented to mitigate the effects of higher raw material costs lc sales growth was primarily driven by the realization of price increases across both business units while new win performance was largely offset by volume declines in the second half of 2011 mainly in fragrances overall lc growth was driven by 8 growth in the emerging markets 

flavors business unit 

on a reported basis flavors sales increased 12 excluding the impact of foreign currency lc sales for the flavors business increased 9 versus the prior year period the increase was driven by new business with our customers followed by the realization of price increases and growth in the underlying demand for our customers’ products sales growth in 2011 includes the impact of exiting approximately 6 million of low margin sales activities lc growth was led by doubledigit gains in savory and beverages and singledigit gains in sweet confectionery all of which benefited from new business higher volumes and realization of price increases regionally the business benefited from doubledigit growth in noam and eame whereas ga had high singledigit lc growth the improvement in eame reflects growth in all categories led by near or doubledigit gains in savory beverages and sweet eame performance continues to be led by our performance in the emerging market countries within the region sales in noam were led by doubledigit gains in savory and beverages lc growth in ga was driven by doubledigit gains in beverages and dairy followed by high singledigit gains in sweet la lc growth of 4 was driven by doubledigit gains in sweet and dairy as well as mid singledigit growth in savory globally flavors growth was led by doubledigit growth in emerging markets 

fragrances business unit 

the fragrances business experienced a 1 increase in reported sales and was down 1 in lc terms compared to 16 lc sales growth during 2010 new wins and the realization of price increases were more than offset by declines in existing business most notably in fragrance ingredients principally related to commodity products and fine fragrance yearoveryear 2011 lc sales performance was led by doubledigit growth in home care along with low singledigit gains in beauty care and fabric care categories offsetting these gains was a 9 decline in fragrance ingredients compared to an 18 increase during 2010 lc growth within the regions was led by ga at 2 mainly due to new business and slightly higher volumes notably within the fabric care which had doubledigit lc gains all other regions were flat to slightly down reflecting gains in hair care and home care that were largely offset by volume declines in fine fragrance in north america as well as declines in fragrance ingredients in all regions global growth was led by singledigit growth in emerging markets which represented more than 40 of total fragrance sales

 cost of goods sold 

cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales increased 210 basis points bps to 604 in 2011 compared to 583 in 2010 the increase versus prior year was mainly driven by higher raw material costs combined with a slightly less favorable sales mix overall raw material costs have increased approximately 10 on a yearoveryear basis these effects were partially offset by improved operating leverage ongoing margin recovery efforts in both businesses including pricing and benefits associated with the european rationalization that was completed in late 2010 

research and development rd 

rd expenses increased approximately 10 million versus the prior year as investments in technology and innovation were largely offset by lower provisions for incentive compensation overall rd expenses decreased 40 bps as a percentage of sales from 83 in 2010 to 79 in 2011 

  

selling and administrative sa 

sa as a percentage of sales decreased 120 bps to 159 versus 171 the 2011 amount includes 335 million related to the mane patent litigation settlement excluding this amount sa would have declined 240 bps to 147 of sales the decrease in sa expenses was driven by lower provisions for incentive compensation and ongoing cost discipline that more than offset planned spend in sales activities mainly in emerging markets to support our growth initiatives 

restructuring and other charges 

 

 strategic initiative 

in december 2011 we recorded a charge to cover a restructuring which involved a reduction in workforce as well as a realignment of responsibilities in our fragrances business unit this alignment partly addresses issues identified in our 2010 strategic review process towards improving the underperforming areas of our portfolio it will result in the redeployment of creative resources in emerging markets and the reorganization from a regional to a global category structure we implemented a plan to streamline business operations globally which resulted in the elimination of 72 positions across fragrances flavors and corporate functions as a result we recorded a provision for severance costs of 98 million to restructuring and other charges net in our 2011 consolidated statement of income and comprehensive income 

european rationalization plan 

during the second quarter 2011 we executed a partial settlement of its pension obligations with the former employees of the drogheda ireland facility as a result we recorded a charge of 39 million related to the european rationalization plan to cover settlements and special termination benefits this settlement was funded primarily through pension plan investment trust assets

we evaluate the performance of business units based on profit before restructuring and other charges net interest expense other expense net and taxes on income see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for the reconciliation to income before taxes 

  

 flavors business unit 

flavors segment profit totaled 2842 million in 2011 211 of sales compared to 2425 million 202 of sales in the comparable 2010 period the improvement in profitability was mainly driven by strong sales growth and increased operating leverage the realization of price increases and margin improvement initiatives that more than offset the effects of higher raw material costs and less favorable sales mix 

fragrances business unit 

fragrances segment profit totaled 2266 million in 2011 157 of sales compared to 2450 million 173 of sales reported in 2010 the decline in profit was driven by sharply higher input costs and weaker sales mix that could only be partially offset by the realization of price increases the benefits of the european restructuring other margin improvement initiatives and lower incentive compensation 

global expenses 

global expenses represent corporate and headquartersrelated expenses which include legal finance human resources and rd and other administrative expenses that are not allocated to an individual business unit in 2011 global expenses were 364 million compared to 611 million during 2010 the decline principally reflects lower incentive compensation 

interest expense 

in 2011 interest expense decreased 41 million to 446 million the decrease in interest expense reflects lower levels of outstanding debt mainly due to 1237 million of longterm debt repayments in 2011 average cost of debt was 47 for the 2011 period compared to 50 in 2010 

other expense net 

other expense net increased approximately 14 million to 95 million in 2011 versus 81 million in 2010 the change was driven by higher foreign exchange losses on outstanding working capital balances principally associated with a general weakening of the us dollar 

income taxes 

the effective tax rate was 286 in 2011 as compared to a rate of 267 in the prior year the current period included a 58 million adjustment of deferred tax assets as a result of us state law changes enacted during the second quarter 2011 and a low effective tax rate on the mane patent litigation settlement 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

cash and cash equivalents 

we had cash and cash equivalents of 3244 million at december 31 2012 compared to 883 million at december 31 2011 of which 1027 million of the balance at december 31 2012 was held outside the united states cash balances held in foreign jurisdictions are in most circumstances available to be repatriated to the united states however they would be subject to united states federal income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits we have not provided us income tax expense on accumulated earnings of our foreign subsidiaries because we have the ability and plan to reinvest the undistributed earnings indefinitely 

effective utilization of the cash generated by our international operations is a critical component of our tax strategy strategic dividend repatriation from foreign subsidiaries creates us taxable income which enables us to realize us deferred tax assets the company regularly repatriates in the form of dividends from its nonus subsidiaries a portion of its current year earnings to fund financial obligations in the us these repatriations of current year earnings totaled 976 million 1195 million and 3605 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

cash flows from operating activities 

operating cash flows in 2012 were 3238 million which includes an outflow of cash of 1055 million associated with the spanish tax settlement as discussed in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements compared to an inflow of 1892 million which included a patent litigation settlement payment of 400 million and 3151 million in 2011 and 2010 respectively the cash flow impact associated with core working capital trade receivables inventories and accounts payable decreased compared to 2011 operating cash flows versus the prior year also reflects lower incentive compensation payments and tax payments made in 2012 compared to 2011 as a result of strong 2010 performance 

working capital current assets less current liabilities totaled 9498 million at yearend 2012 compared to 7527 million at december 31 2011 this increase in working capital primarily reflects a 236 million increase in cash balances partly associated with additional drawdowns under the new facility 

as of december 31 2012 net trade receivables increased by 271 million as compared to december 31 2011 principally related to higher sales levels during the fourth quarter 2012 versus the fourth quarter 

cash flows used in investing activities 

net investing activities in 2012 utilized 1143 million compared to 1312 million and 1068 million in 2011 and 2010 respectively the improvement in the investing activities was principally driven by the proceeds from the termination of life insurance contracts which are used to informally fund our deferred compensation plan as discussed in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements 

additions to property plant and equipment were 1261 million 1275 million and 1063 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively and are again expected to approach 5 of sales in 2013 investments were largely focused on emerging markets and new technology consistent with our strategy

net financing activities in 2012 had an inflow of 254 million compared to outflows of 1007 million and 1567 million in 2011 and 2010 respectively the inflow of cash provided by financing activities in 2012 over the outflow of cash in 2011 principally reflects changes in the revolving credit facility borrowings in 2012 compared to 2011 which was partially offset by increased dividend payments in 2012 compared to 2011 

at december 31 2012 we had 10312 million of debt outstanding compared to 8949 million outstanding at december 31 2011 

  

we paid dividends totaling 1309 million 903 million and 812 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively the cash dividend declared per share in 2012 2011 and 2010 was 130 116 and 104 respectively the increase in the dividends paid from 2011 to 2012 reflects both a higher level of dividends declared in 2012 as well as the accelerated payment in december 2012 of our fourth quarter dividend 

in december 2012 the board of directors authorized a 250 million share repurchase program which commenced in the first quarter of 2013 and is expected to be completed by the end of 2014 based on the total authorized amount of 250 million available under the repurchase program approximately 38 million shares or 47 of shares outstanding based on the market price and shares outstanding as of december 31 2012 could be repurchased under the program the purchases will be made from time to time on the open market or through private transactions as market and business conditions warrant repurchased shares will be placed into treasury stock no repurchases were made during the fourth quarter of 2012 

capital resources 

operating cash flow provides the primary source of funds for capital investment needs dividends paid to shareholders and debt repayments we anticipate that cash flows from operations and availability under our existing credit facilities are sufficient to meet our investing and financing needs for at least the next eighteen months we regularly assess our capital structure including both current and longterm debt instruments as compared to our cash generation and investment needs in order to provide ample flexibility and to optimize our leverage ratios while we are comfortable with our current leverage ratios our cash generation and capital structure would support some increase in leverage we believe our existing cash balances are sufficient to meet our debt service requirements including 100 million which is due july 12 2013 related to our senior unsecured notes issued in 2006 

we supplement shortterm liquidity with access to capital markets mainly through bank credit facilities and issuance of commercial paper we did not issue commercial paper during 2012 and 2011 

on november 9 2011 iff and certain subsidiaries the “borrowers” entered into a new credit agreement with citibank na as administrative agent and the other lenders agents arrangers and bookrunners to replace the previous credit agreement set to expire november 23 2012 the credit agreement which was amended and restated on march 9 2012 provides for a revolving loan facility in an aggregate amount up to an equivalent of 9420 million the “new facility” there are three tranches under the new facility the tranche a facility is available to all of the borrowers other than iff spain in us dollars euros swiss francs japanese yen and british sterling in an aggregate amount up to an equivalent of 458 million and contains sublimits of 500 million for swing line borrowings the tranche b facility is available to all of the borrowers in euros swiss francs japanese yen and british sterling in an aggregate amount up to an equivalent of 3540 million and contains sublimits of €500 million for swing line borrowings the tranche c facility is available to all of the borrowers in euros only in an aggregate amount up to €100505400 the new facility will be available for general corporate purposes of each borrower and its subsidiaries the obligations under the new facility are unsecured and the company has guaranteed the obligations of each other borrower under the new facility the new facility will mature on november 9 2016 but may be extended for up to two additional oneyear periods at the company’s request subject to the agreement of the lenders having commitments representing more than 50 of the aggregate commitments of all lenders under the new facility borrowings under the new facility bear interest at an annual rate of libor plus a margin currently 125 bps linked to our credit rating the interest rate under the new facility at december 31 2012 and 2011 was 141 and 177 respectively the new facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants including the requirement for us to maintain at the end of each fiscal quarter a ratio of net debt for borrowed money to adjusted ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization in respect of the previous 12month period of not more than 325 to 1 

under the new facility we are required to maintain at the end of each fiscal quarter a ratio of net debt for borrowed money to adjusted ebitda in respect of the previous 12month period of not more than 325 to 1 

  

based on this ratio at december 31 2012 our covenant compliance would provide overall borrowing capacity of 11862 million 

as of december 31 2012 we had total borrowings under the new facility of 2967 million the amount which we are able to draw down on under the agreement is limited by financial covenants as described in more detail below however our drawdown capacity on the new facility was limited to 6482 million based on existing balances outstanding under the facility at december 31 2012 

at december 31 2012 and 2011 we were in compliance with all financial and other covenants including the net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio at december 31 2012 our net debtadjusted ebitda 1 ratio was 120 to 1 as defined by the new facility well below the financial covenants of existing outstanding debt failure to comply with the financial and other covenants under our debt agreements would constitute default and would allow the lenders to accelerate the maturity of all indebtedness under the related agreement if such acceleration were to occur we would not have sufficient liquidity available to repay the indebtedness we would likely have to seek amendments under the agreements for relief from the financial covenants or repay the debt with proceeds from the issuance of new debt or equity andor asset sales if necessary we may be unable to amend the agreements or raise sufficient capital to repay such obligations in the event the maturities are accelerated 

 

  

  

   

   

compliance with existing governmental requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment has not materially affected our operations earnings or competitive position in 2012 and 2011 we spent 2 million on capital projects and 16 million and 17 million respectively in operating expenses and governmental charges for the purpose of complying with such regulations expenditures for these purposes will continue for the foreseeable future in addition we are party to a number of proceedings brought under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act or similar state statutes it is expected that the impact of any judgments in or voluntary settlements of such proceedings will not be material to our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

contractual obligations 

at december 31 2012 we had contractual payment obligations due within the time periods as specified in the following table 

 

  

     the table above does not include 412 million of the total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions and approximately 74 million of associated accrued interest due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential cash flows the company is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid 

critical accounting policies and use of estimates 

our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements as disclosed in note 1 the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and accompanying disclosures these estimates are based on management’s best judgment of current events and actions that we may undertake in the future actual results may ultimately differ from estimates 

  

those areas requiring the greatest degree of management judgment or deemed most critical to our financial reporting involve 

the periodic assessment of potential impairment of intangible assets acquired in business combinations we currently have net intangible assets including goodwill of 7023 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 we early adopted asu no 20118 “intangibles — goodwill and other topic 350 testing goodwill for impairment” we conduct a qualitative assessment as of november 30th on an annual basis or more frequently when significant change in circumstances that would be considered a triggering event indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable the goodwill qualitative impairment assessment requires us to perform an assessment for each reporting unit to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount in 2012 the company reevaluated its reporting unit structure and identified three reporting units 1 flavors 2 fragrance compounds and 3 fragrance ingredients prior to 2012 the company had identified two reporting units flavors and fragrances as a result in 2012 the company reallocated the goodwill previously allocated to its fragrances reporting unit to its fragrance compounds and fragrance ingredients reporting units 

the qualitative assessment considers various factors for each reporting unit including the macroeconomic environment industry and market specific conditions financial performance cost impacts and issues or events specific to the reporting unit if it is determined that it is more likely than not the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of a reporting unit we perform a “step one” goodwill impairment test we completed our annual qualitative assessment as of november 30 2012 for the flavors reporting unit which indicated no impairment of goodwill as it was determined it is more likely than not that the fair values exceed the carrying value of our reporting unit the company performed the annual goodwill impairment test utilizing the twostep approach for the fragrance compounds and fragrance ingredients reporting units by assessing the fair value of our reporting units based on discounted cash flows which indicated no impairment of goodwill as the estimated fair values substantially exceeded the carrying values of each of these reporting units 

the analysis and evaluation of income taxes we account for taxes under the asset and liability method under this method deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax return bases of assets and liabilities a valuation allowance is recognized if based on the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized the assessment of the need for a valuation allowance requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future earnings reversal of existing temporary differences and available tax planning strategies if actual experience differs from these estimates and assumptions the recorded deferred tax asset may not be fully realized resulting in an increase to income tax expense in our results of operations 

the company has not established deferred tax liabilities for undistributed foreign earnings as it has plans to and intends to indefinitely reinvest those earnings to finance foreign activities 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes we first determine whether it is “more likely than not” that we would sustain our tax position if the relevant tax authority were to audit the position with full knowledge of all the relevant facts and other information for those tax positions that meet this threshold we measure the amount of tax benefit based on the largest amount of tax benefit that we have a greater than 50 chance of realizing in a final settlement with the relevant authority those tax positions failing to qualify for initial recognition are recognized in the first interim period in which they meet the more likely than not standard this evaluation is made at the time that we adopt a tax position and whenever there is new information and is based upon management’s evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date we maintain a cumulative risk portfolio relating to all of our uncertainties in income taxes in order to perform this analysis but the evaluation of our tax positions requires significant judgment and estimation in part because in certain cases 

  

tax law is subject to varied interpretation and whether a tax position will ultimately be sustained may be uncertain we do not currently believe that any of our pending tax assessments even if ultimately resolved against us would have a material impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

the evaluation of potential litigation and environmental liabilities where changing circumstances rules and regulations require regular reassessment of related practices and anticipated costs we are subject to certain legal claims regarding products and other matters as well as environmentalrelated matters significant management judgment is involved in determining when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the extent to which it can be reasonably estimated 

we regularly assess potential liabilities with respect to all legal claims based on the most recent available information in consultation with outside counsel we have engaged on our behalf to handle the defense of such matters to the extent a liability is considered to be probable and reasonably estimable we recognize a corresponding liability if the reasonably estimated liability is a range we recognize that amount considered most likely or in the absence of such a determination the minimum reasonably estimated liability to the extent such claims are covered by various insurance policies we separately evaluate the right to recovery and estimate the related insurance claim receivable management judgments involve determination as to whether a liability has been incurred the reasonably estimated amount of that liability and any potential insurance recovery 

we regularly evaluate potential environmental exposure in terms of total estimated cost and the viability of other potentially responsible parties “prp’s” associated with our exposure recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress and additional information becomes available critical management assumptions relate to expected total costs to remediate and the financial viability of prp’s to share such costs 

determination of the various assumptions employed in the valuation of pension and retiree health care expense and associated obligations amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined from actuarial valuations inherent in such valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets discount rates at which the liabilities could be settled rates of increase in future compensation levels mortality rates and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore affect expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods 

we consider a number of factors in determining and selecting assumptions for the overall expected longterm rate of return on plan assets we consider the historical longterm return experience of our assets the current and expected allocation of our plan assets and expected longterm rates of return we derive these expected longterm rates of return with the assistance of our investment advisors we base our expected allocation of plan assets on a diversified portfolio consisting of domestic and international equity securities fixed income real estate and alternative asset classes 

we consider a variety of factors in determining and selecting our assumptions for the discount rate at december 31 for the us plans the discount rate was based on the internal rate of return for a portfolio of moody’s aaa aa and merrill lynch aaaaa high quality bonds with maturities that are consistent with the projected future benefit payment obligations of the plan the rate of compensation increase for all plans and the medical cost trend rate for the applicable us plans are based on plan experience 

with respect to the us plans the expected rate of return on plan assets was determined based on an asset allocation model using the current target allocation real rates of return by asset class and an anticipated inflation rate the target asset allocation consists of approximately 50 in equity securities and 50 in fixed income securities the plan has achieved a compounded annual rate of return of 78 over the previous 20 years at december 31 2012 the actual asset allocation was 50 in equity securities 49 in fixed income securities and 1 in cash equivalents 

  

the expected rate of return for the nonus plans employs a similar set of criteria adapted for local investments inflation rates and in certain cases specific government requirements the target asset allocation for the nonus plans consists of approximately 5560 in fixed income securities 20 25 in equity securities 510 in real estate and 510 in alternative investments at december 31 2012 the actual asset allocation was 59 in fixed income investments 22 in equity investments 9 in real estate investments 8 in alternative investments and 2 in cash and cash equivalents 

changes in pension and other postemployment benefits and associated expenses may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions the impact that a 025 decrease in the discount rate or a 1 change in the medical cost trend rate would have on our pension and other postemployment benefit expense as applicable is as follows 

 

 the effect of a 1 increase in the medical cost trend rate would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and the annual postretirement expense by approximately 73 million and 04 million respectively a 1 decrease in the rate would decrease the obligation and expense by approximately 69 million and 04 million respectively 

the ongoing assessment of the valuation of inventory given the large number of natural ingredients employed the quality of which may be diminished over time we hold a majority of our inventory as raw materials providing the greatest degree of flexibility in manufacture and use as of december 31 2012 we maintained 47 of our inventory as raw materials materials are evaluated based on shelf life known uses and anticipated demand based on forecasted customer order activity and changes in productsales mix management policy provides for an ongoing assessment of inventory with adjustments recorded when an item is deemed to be slow moving or obsolete 

we believe that we have considered relevant circumstances that we may be currently subject to and the financial statements accurately reflect our best estimate of the impact of these items in our results of operations financial condition and cash flows for the years presented we have discussed the decision process and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 

new accounting standards 

in may 2011 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued authoritative guidance that provides a consistent definition of fair value and ensures that the fair value measurements and disclosure requirements are similar between us gaap and international financial reporting standards this guidance enhances the disclosure requirements particularly for level 3 fair value measurements this guidance was effective as of january 1 2012 and did not have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements 

in june 2011 the fasb issued revised guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income this revised guidance eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income “oci” as part of the consolidated statement of shareholders’ equity and provides two alternatives for presenting the components of net income and oci either i in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or ii in two separate but consecutive financial statements consisting of an income statement followed by a separate statement of comprehensive income additionally items that are reclassified from oci to net income must be presented on the face of the financial statements although in december 2011 the fasb deferred the reclassification 

  

requirement of this guidance indefinitely the company has adopted this revised guidance as of january 1 2012 and it did not have an impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements 

nongaap financial measures 

the company uses nongaap financial operating measures in this annual report including i local currency sales which eliminates the effects that result from translating its international sales in us dollars ii likeforlike sales which eliminates the effects of local currency and the strategic decision to exit certain low margin sales iii adjusted cash flow from operations which excludes the impact of the payment pursuant to the spanish tax settlement iv adjusted sa which excludes the impact of the mane patent settlement litigation and v adjusted effective tax rate which excludes the spanish tax charge the company also provides the nongaap measures adjusted ebitda which excludes certain specified items and noncash items as set forth in the company’s debt agreements and net debt which is adjusted for deferred gain on interest rate swaps and cash and cash equivalents solely for the purpose of providing information on the extent to which the company is in compliance with debt covenants contained in its debt agreements 

we have included each of these nongaap measures in order to provide additional information regarding our underlying operating results and comparable yearoveryear performance such information is supplemental to information presented in accordance with gaap and is not intended to represent a presentation in accordance with gaap in discussing our historical and expected future results and financial condition we believe it is meaningful for investors to be made aware of and to be assisted in a better understanding of on a periodtoperiod comparable basis financial amounts both including and excluding these identified items as well as the impact of exchange rate fluctuations and the exit of certain low margin sales activities on operating results and financial condition we believe such additional nongaap information provides investors with an overall perspective of the periodtoperiod performance of our business in addition management internally reviews each of these nongaap measures to evaluate performance on a comparative periodtoperiod basis in terms of absolute performance trends and expected future performance with respect to our business a material limitation of these nongaap measures is that such measures do not reflect actual gaap amounts and payments pursuant to the spanish tax settlement include actual cash outlays we compensate for such limitations by using these measures as one of several metrics including gaap measures these nongaap measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we operate on a global basis and are exposed to currency fluctuation related to the manufacture and sale of our products in currencies other than the us dollar the major foreign currencies involve the markets in the european union great britain mexico brazil china india indonesia australia and japan although all regions are subject to foreign currency fluctuations versus the us dollar we actively monitor our foreign currency exposures in all major markets in which we operate and employ a variety of techniques to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations including foreign currency hedging activities 

we have established a centralized reporting system to evaluate the effects of changes in interest rates currency exchange rates and other relevant market risks our risk management procedures include the monitoring of interest rate and foreign exchange exposures and hedge positions utilizing statistical analyses of cash flows market value and sensitivity analysis however the use of these techniques to quantify the market risk of such instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of their accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions for the year ended december 31 2012 the company’s exposure to market risk was estimated using sensitivity analyses which illustrate the change in the fair value of a derivative financial instrument assuming hypothetical changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts with the objective of reducing exposure to cash flow volatility associated with foreign currency receivables and payables and with anticipated purchases of certain raw materials used in operations these contracts the counterparties to which are major international financial institutions generally involve the exchange of one currency for a second currency at a future date and have maturities not exceeding twelve months the gain or loss on the hedging instrument and services is recorded in earnings at the same time as the transaction being hedged is recorded in earnings at december 31 2012 the company’s foreign currency exposures pertaining to derivative contracts exist with the euro japanese yen british pound indonesia rupiah chinese renminbi and south african rand based on a hypothetical decrease or increase of 10 in the applicable balance sheet exchange rates primarily against the us dollar the estimated fair value of the company’s foreign currency forward contracts would increase or decrease by approximately 25 million however any change in the value of the contracts real or hypothetical would be significantly offset by a corresponding change in the value of the underlying hedged items 

we have a japanese yenus dollar currency swap related to monthly sale and purchase of products between the us and japan a hypothetical decrease or increase of 10 in the value of the us dollar against the japanese yen the estimated fair value of the company’s foreign currency forward contracts would not have a material effect 

we have also used nonus dollar borrowings and foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the foreign currency exposures of our net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries primarily in the european union based on a hypothetical decrease or increase of 10 in the value of the us dollar against the euro the estimated fair value of the company’s foreign currency forward contracts would change by approximately 15 million however any change in the value of the contracts real or hypothetical would be significantly offset by a corresponding change in the value of the underlying hedged items 

we use derivative instruments as part of our interest rate risk management strategy the derivative instruments used are comprised principally of fixed to variable rate interest rate swaps based on the libor plus an interest mark up the notional amount interest payment and maturity date of the swaps match the principal interest payment and maturity date of the related debt and the swaps are valued using observable benchmark rates based on a hypothetical decrease or increase of one percentage point in libor the estimated fair value of the company’s interest rate swaps would change by less than 10 million 

at december 31 2012 the fair value of our fixed rate debt was 882 million based on a hypothetical decrease of 10 in interest rates the estimated fair value of the company’s fixed debt would increase by 4 million 

  

we purchase certain commodities such as natural gas electricity petroleum based products and certain crop related items we generally purchase these commodities based upon market prices that are established with the vendor as part of the purchase process in general we do not use commodity financial instruments to hedge commodity prices

core competencies 

we focus on five core competencies that we believe enable us to i successfully provide our customers with superior products ii drive productivity and efficiency gains and iii improve our margins and our cash flow in that regard we strive to 

 

   

  

  

  

  

 our product offerings 

flavors 

flavors are the key building blocks that impart taste in processed food and beverage products and as such play a significant role in determining consumer preference of the end products in which they are used while we are a global leader our flavors business is regional in nature with different formulas that reflect local taste and ingredients preferences as a leading creator of flavors we help our customers deliver on the promise of delicious and healthy foods and drinks that appeal to consumers our flavors business includes four categories of products 1 savory 2 beverages 3 sweet pharmaceutical and oral care “sweet” and 4 dairy we create our flavors in our regional creative and technical centers that allow us to satisfy local taste preferences while helping to ensure regulatory compliance and production standards we also manufacture a limited amount of flavor ingredients for our use in developing flavor compounds 

 

  

  

   

 we develop thousands of different flavors for our customers most of which are tailormade and we continuously develop new formulas in order to meet changing consumer preferences and customer needs consumers especially those in developed markets such as the united states and europe are increasingly seeking to focus on products which promote health and wellness they want food and beverage products that are good for them but which taste good our objective is to capture a significant share of this shift in consumer demand by capitalizing on the ability of our naturals and proprietary ingredients and taste modulation technology to provide consumers with healthier solutions without changing the taste experience of the food or beverage for example our sweetness modulation technology combined with our blend of natural sweeteners allows products to have a reduced sugar content without affecting taste our sodium modulation technology seeks to reduce the content of salt in consumer products while at the same time maximizing taste by enhancing the flavors of other ingredients 

we are also developing sophisticated flavor profiles in our culinessence™ program to bring authentic culinary flavors to our customers the success of our recent launches of new culinary chicken and beef flavors was a direct result of this program 

fragrances 

we are a global leader in the creation of fragrances our fragrances are a key component in the world’s finest perfumes and bestknown consumer brands including beauty care fabric care personal wash and home care products our fragrances business consists of three categories of products 1 fine fragrance and beauty care 2 functional fragrances and 3 fragrance ingredients 

 

  

  

 our perfumers have access to our large portfolio of innovative ingredients to support their creativity which in turn provides our customers with a unique identity for their brands we also create innovative delivery systems including our i proprietary encapsulation technology which consists of individual fragrance droplets which are coated with a protective polymetric shell to deliver superior fragrance performance throughout a product’s lifecycle and ii our exclusive polymer delivery system polyiff which is a “solid fragrance” technology that allows us to add scent to functional or molded plastic 

we believe that our inhouse naturals facilities led by laboratoire monique rémy lmr in grasse france is the industry standard for quality natural materials offering decades of experience understanding natural products and perfecting the process of transforming naturals such as narcissus jasmine and blackcurrant bud into pure absolutes that retain the unique fragrance of their origin 

  

we also collaborate with the leading art and fashion schools in the world to tap into the creative minds of the future leaders of fashion and design we collaborate with writers artists filmmakers and scientists to expose our perfumers to new and constantly evolving creative territories 

research and product development 

we consider our research and product development infrastructure to be one of our key competencies and we focus and invest substantial resources in the research and development of new and innovative compounds formulas and technologies and the application of these to our customers’ products using the knowledge gained from our consumer insights program we strategically focus our resources to formulate the two main components of a flavor or fragrance 1 innovative materials taste and scent building blocks and 2 delivery systems taste and scent releases we maintain four research and development centers around the world at which we employ scientists and application engineers to support i the discovery of new materials ii the development of new technologies such as our delivery systems iii the creation of new compounds and iv the enhancement of existing ingredients and compounds 

in our 17 creative centers around the world including our newest facilities in shanghai sao paulo mumbai and moscow teams of flavorists and perfumers work with our customers’ product development groups to create the exact scent or taste they are seeking in 2011 we employed about 1175 employees in research and product development activities we spent 220 million 219 million and 185 million or approximately 8 of our sales in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively on rd and product development activities 

our ingredients research program discovers molecules found in natural substances and creates new molecules that are subsequently tested for their fragrance or flavor value to broaden our offering of natural innovative and unique products we seek out collaborations with research institutions and other companies throughout the world we have created a number of such collaborations that strengthen and broaden the pipeline of new and innovative products we intend to launch in the coming years 

the development of new and customized flavor and fragrance products is a complex process calling upon the combined knowledge of our scientists flavorists and perfumers scientists from various disciplines work in project teams with the flavorists and perfumers to develop flavor and fragrance products with consumer preferred performance characteristics the development of new flavor and fragrance compounds requires i indepth knowledge of the flavor and fragrance characteristics of the various ingredients we use ii an understanding of how the many ingredients in a consumer product interact and iii the creation of controlled release and delivery systems to enhance flavor and fragrance performance to facilitate this process in 2011 we formed a scientific advisory board comprising of five expert scientists to provide external perspectives on our research and development programs 

development of new flavors and fragrances is driven by a variety of sources including requests from our customers who are in need of a specific flavor or fragrance for use in a new or modified consumer product or as a result of internal initiatives stemming from our consumer insights program our product development team works in partnership with our scientists and researchers to optimize the consumer appeal of the flavor or fragrance it then becomes a collaborative process between our researchers our product development team and our customers to perfect the flavor or fragrance so that it is ready to be included in the final consumer product 

in addition to creating new flavors and fragrances our researchers and product development teams advise customers on ways to improve their existing products by adjusting or substituting current ingredients with more readily accessible or less expensive materials or modifying the current ingredients to produce an enhanced yield often this results in creating a better value proposition for the consumer 

our flavor and fragrance formulas are treated as trade secrets and remain our proprietary asset our business is not materially dependent upon any individual patent trademark or license 

  

supply chain 

we have an integrated supply chain from raw material sourcing through manufacturing quality assurance regulatory compliance and distribution which permits us to provide our customers with consistent quality products on a timely and costeffective basis 

procurement  the ingredients that we use in our compounds are both natural and synthetic we purchase approximately 9000 different raw materials from about 2200 domestic and international suppliers approximately half of the materials we purchase are naturals or crop related items and the other half are synthetics and chemicals natural ingredients are derived from flowers fruits and other botanical products as well as from animal products they contain varying numbers of organic chemicals which are responsible for the fragrance or flavor of the natural product the natural products are purchased in processed or semiprocessed form some are used in compounds in the state in which they are purchased and others after further processing natural products together with various chemicals are also used as raw materials for the manufacture of synthetic ingredients by chemical processes our flavor products also include extracts and seasonings derived from various fruits vegetables nuts herbs and spices as well as microbiologicallyderived ingredients we manufacture most of our synthetic ingredients for use in our fragrance compounds as well as for sale to others 

while we purchase a diverse portfolio of raw materials about 80 of our spending is focused on approximately 1000 materials which allows us to leverage our buying power with suppliers in order to ensure our supply of raw materials achieve favorable pricing and provide timely transparency regarding inflationary trends to our customers we continue to be focused on i implementing a forward buy strategy ii entering into supplier relationships to gain access to supplies that we do not have iii implementing indexed pricing iv reducing the complexity of our formulations and v evaluating whether it is more profitable to buy or make an ingredient we are also concentrating on local country sourcing with our own procurement professionals 

manufacturing and distribution we have 29 manufacturing sites around the world that support more than 36000 products our major manufacturing facilities are located in the united states the netherlands spain great britain argentina brazil mexico australia china india indonesia japan and singapore our supply chain initiatives in developing markets are focused on increasing capacity and investments in key technologies while we focus on consolidation and cost optimization in mature markets in addition to our own manufacturing facilities we develop relationships with third parties that permit us to expand the technologies capabilities and capacity that we can access to serve our customers 

based on the regional nature of the flavors business and the concerns regarding the transportability of raw materials we have established smaller manufacturing facilities in our local markets that are focused on local needs products within the fragrances business are typically composed of compounds that are more stable and more transportable around the world consequently we have fewer manufacturing facilities within our fragrances business which produce compounds and ingredients for global distribution 

during 2011 our 25 largest customers accounted for 53 of our sales sales to the largest customer accounted for 11 10 and 11 of our sales in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively these sales were largely in our fragrances business 

governmental regulation 

we develop produce and market our products in a number of jurisdictions throughout the world and are subject to federal regional and local legislation and regulations in each of the various countries our flavor and many of our fragrance products are intended for the food beverage and pharmaceutical industries which are subject to strict quality and regulatory standards as a result we are required to meet these strict standards which in recent years have become increasingly stringent 

in addition we are subject to various rules relating to health work safety and environment at the local and international levels in the various countries in which we operate our manufacturing facilities throughout the 

  

world are subject to environmental standards relating to air emissions sewage discharges the use of hazardous materials waste disposal practices and clean up of existing environmental contamination in recent years there has been a significant increase in the stringency of environmental regulation and enforcement of environmental standards and the costs of compliance have risen significantly we expect that the trend of increased regulation and disclosure will continue in the future 

our products and operations are subject to regulation by governmental agencies in each of the markets in which we operate these agencies include 1 the food and drug administration and equivalent international agencies that regulate the flavors and other ingredients in consumer products 2 the environmental protection agency and equivalent international agencies that regulate our fragrance compounds 3 the occupational safety and health administration and equivalent international agencies that regulate the working conditions in our manufacturing research laboratories and creative centers 4 local and international agencies that regulate trade and customs and 5 the drug enforcement administration and other international agencies that regulate controlled chemicals that we use in our operations for example in the continuing implementation of the eu reach registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemical substances regulations we will be registering a number of chemical substances in advance of the next registration deadline of may 2013 

strategic priorities 

we are focused on generating sustainable profitable growth in our business and positioning our portfolio for longterm growth in 2010 we performed an indepth strategic review of our company evaluating the economic profitability of each of our product categories our regions and our customers as a result we believe we can improve our longterm business performance and increase shareholder value by leveraging our geographic reach strengthening our innovation platform and maximizing our portfolio the key elements of these strategic priorities are the following 

 

  

  

 competition 

the market for flavors and fragrances is highly competitive based on annual sales our main competitors consist of 1 the three other large global flavor and fragrance manufacturers givaudan firmenich and symrise 

  

2 midsized companies 3 numerous small and local manufacturers with more limited research and development capabilities who focus on narrow market segments and local customers and 4 consumer product companies who may develop their own flavors or fragrances the flavors and fragrances market is part of a larger market which supplies a variety of ingredients and components that consumer products companies utilize in their products the broader market includes large multinational companies or smaller regional and local participants which supply products such as seasonings texturizers spices enzymes certain food related commodities fortified products and cosmetic ingredients we together with the other top three companies represent approximately 70 of the total estimated sales in the global flavors and fragrances subsegment of the broader market over the last five years there has been a trend towards consolidation 

we believe that our ability to compete successfully in the flavors and fragrance market is based on 1 our understanding of consumers 2 innovation arising from the creative skills of our perfumers and flavorists and the technological advances resulting from our research and development activities 3 our ability to develop products which are tailor made for our customers’ needs 4 the quality reliability and cost effectiveness of our products 5 the quality of our customer service 6 the support provided by our marketing and application groups and 7 an understanding of the regulatory requirements in the markets in which our customers operate 

large multinational customers and increasingly midsized customers may limit the number of their suppliers placing some on “core lists” giving them priority for development and production of their new or modified products to compete more successfully in this environment we must make continued investments in customer relationships and tailor product research and development in order to anticipate customers’ needs provide effective service and secure and maintain inclusion on certain “core lists” 

employee relations 

at december 31 2011 we had approximately 5600 employees worldwide of whom approximately 1400 are employed in the united states we believe that relations with our employees are good

 item 1a risk factors tableend we routinely encounter and address risks in conducting our business some of these risks may cause our future results to be different — sometimes materially different — than we presently anticipate below are certain important operational and strategic risks that could adversely affect our business how we react to material future developments as well as how our competitors react to those developments could also affect our future results 

volatility and increases in the price of raw materials energy and transportation could harm our profits 

we use many different raw materials for our business including essential oils extracts and concentrates derived from fruits vegetables flowers woods and other botanicals animal products raw fruits organic chemicals and petroleumbased chemicals during 2011 the cost of raw materials exceeded our initial estimates and we anticipate modest inflation in commodity and other raw material prices in 2012 historically we have experienced the greatest amount of price volatility in natural products that represent approximately half of our raw material purchases availability and pricing of these natural products such as citrus and vanilla can be impacted by crop size and quality weather or alternative land use which we cannot control 

if we are unable to increase the prices to our customers of our fragrance or flavor products to cover raw material and other input cost increases or if we are unable to achieve cost savings to offset such cost increases our profits and operating results will be adversely affected increases in prices of our products to customers may lead to declines in volume and we may not be able to accurately predict the volume impact of price increases which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in addition we source many of our raw materials globally to help ensure quality control if the cost of energy shipping and transportation increases and we are unable to pass along these costs to our customers our profit margins would be adversely affected furthermore increasing our prices to our customers could result in longterm sales declines or loss of market share if our customers find alternative suppliers or choose to reformulate their consumer products to use fewer ingredients which could have a longterm impact on our results of operations 

to mitigate our sourcing risk we maintain strategic stock levels for critical items however if we do not accurately estimate the amount of raw materials that will be used or the geographic region in which we will need these materials our margins could be adversely affected 

the current volatility in the global economy may adversely affect consumer spending and may negatively impact our business and operating results 

our flavors and fragrances are components of a wide assortment of global consumer products throughout the world since mid2008 the global economy has experienced significant recessionary pressures and declines 

  

in consumer confidence and economic growth these conditions led to economic contractions in the developed economies and reduced growth rates in the emerging markets while some segments of the global economy appear to be recovering the ongoing debt crisis in europe and the austerity plans being adopted in many countries has and may in the near future increase unemployment and underemployment decrease salaries and wage rates increase energy prices and inflation or result in other marketwide cost pressures that will adversely affect demand for consumer products in both developed and emerging markets reduced consumer spending may cause changes in our customer orders including reduced demand for our flavors and fragrances increased pressure to reduce the price of our flavors and fragrances andor order cancellations to the extent that the volatility in global economic conditions continue our sales profitability and overall operating results could be adversely affected 

we may not successfully develop and introduce new products that appeal to our customers or our customers may not accurately anticipate and respond to global consumer market trends 

our growth and performance largely depends on our ability to successfully develop and introduce new products and product improvements that appeal to our customers and ultimately to global consumers we must continually anticipate and react to in a timely and costefficient manner changes in consumer preferences and demands we cannot be certain that we will successfully achieve our innovation goals we currently spend approximately 8 of our sales on research and development however such investments may only generate future revenues to the extent that we are able to successfully develop products that meet our customers’ specifications that can be delivered at an acceptable price and that are accepted by the targeted consumer market furthermore there may be significant lag times from the time we incur rd costs to the time that these rd costs may result in increased revenue consequently even when we have “won” a project our ability to generate revenues as a result of these investments is subject to numerous economic and other risks that are outside of our control including delays by our customers in the launch of a new product insufficient resources allocated by our customers to promoting the new product anticipated sales by our customers not being realized or changes in market preferences or demands 

failure to maintain the integrity of our raw materials supply chain and finished goods may adversely impact sales and our results of operations litigation costs and our reputation 

the manufacture and sale of our products are subject to various regulatory requirements in each of the countries in which our products are manufactured and sold in addition we are subject to product safety and compliance requirements established by the industry or similar oversight bodies we use a variety of strategies methodologies and tools to i identify current product standards ii assess relative risks in our supply chain that can impact product integrity iii monitor internal and external performance and iv test raw materials and finished goods to minimize the likelihood of product or process noncompliance 

if a product noncompliance event were to go undetected we could be subject to customer claims recalls penalties litigation costs andor settlements remediation costs or loss of sales these consequences would be exacerbated if our customer did not identify the defect and there was a resulting impact at the consumer level this could lead to potentially large scale adverse publicity recalls and potential consumer litigation furthermore adverse publicity about our products including concerns about product safety or similar issues whether real or perceived could harm our reputation and result in an immediate adverse effect on our sales as well as require us to utilize significant resources to rebuild our reputation 

the increase in demand for consumer products using flavors and fragrances has been driven by factors outside of our control and if these factors do not persist our future growth could be adversely affected 

demand for consumer products using flavors and fragrances has been stimulated and broadened by changing social habits and economic growth especially in emerging markets nearly 46 of our 2011 sales were generated in emerging markets and we expect emerging markets to significantly contribute to our future growth increasing consumer demand for products using flavors and fragrances is dependent on factors such as increases 

  

in personal income dualearner households teenage population leisure time health concerns and urbanization and by the continued growth in world population all of which are outside of our control changes in any number of external economic factors or changes in social or consumer preferences could materially adversely impact our results of operations accordingly our future growth will depend upon the continued economic growth and development of consumer spending on products for which we supply the flavor or fragrance in these global markets 

our international operations are subject to economic political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position 

we operate on a global basis with manufacturing and sales facilities in the united states europe africa and the middle east latin america and greater asia during 2011 the majority of our net sales were generated outside the united states and we intend to continue expansion of our international operations as a result our business is increasingly exposed to risks inherent in international operations these risks which can vary substantially by market are described in many of the risk factors in this section and include the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 these factors may increase in importance as we expand our operations in emerging markets as part of our growth strategy 

in addition there is a risk of potentially higher incidence of fraud or corruption in certain foreign jurisdictions or increased risk of internal control issues as needed we conduct internal investigations control testing and compliance reviews to help ensure that we are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations additionally we could be subject to inquiries or investigations by government and other regulatory bodies any determination that our operations or activities are not in compliance with us laws including the foreign corrupt practices act or international laws and regulations could expose us to significant fines penalties or other sanctions that may harm our business and reputation 

  

our ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights 

we rely on patents and trade secrets to protect our intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to protect our intellectual property rights we often rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary fragrance and flavor formulations as this does not require us to publicly file information regarding our intellectual property if a third party infringes upon our intellectual property or if a third party claims that we have infringed upon their intellectual property rights we could incur significant costs in connection with legal actions to assert our intellectual property rights or to defend ourselves from assertions of invalidity infringement or misappropriation for those intellectual property rights that are protected by way of trade secrets this litigation could result in even higher costs and potentially the loss of certain rights as we would not have a perfected intellectual property right that precludes others from making using or selling our products or processes 

for intellectual property rights that we seek to protect through patents we cannot be certain that these rights if obtained will not later be opposed invalidated or circumvented in addition even if such rights are obtained in the united states the laws of some of the other countries in which our products are or may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states if other parties were to infringe on our intellectual property rights or if a third party successfully asserted that we had infringed on their intellectual property rights it could materially and adversely affect our future results of operations by i reducing the price that we could obtain in the marketplace for products which are based on such rights ii increasing the royalty or other fees that we may be required to pay in connection with such rights or iii limiting the volume if any of such products that we can sell 

our business is highly competitive and if we are unable to compete effectively our sales and results of operations will suffer 

the market for flavors and fragrances is highly competitive we face vigorous competition from companies throughout the world including multinational and specialized flavor and fragrance companies as well as consumer product companies who may develop their own flavors or fragrances some of our competitors specialize in one or more of our product segments while others participate in many of our product segments in addition some of our global competitors may have greater resources than we do or may have proprietary products that could permit them to respond to changing business and economic conditions more effectively than we can consolidation of our competitors may exacerbate these risks 

competition in our business is based on innovation product quality pricing quality of our customer service the support provided by our marketing and application groups and our understanding of consumers it is difficult for us to predict the timing and scale of our competitors’ actions in these areas the discovery and development of new flavor and fragrance materials protection of the company’s intellectual property and development and retention of key employees are important issues in our ability to compete in our businesses increased competition by existing or future competitors including aggressive price competition could result in the potential loss of substantial sales or create the need for us to reduce prices or increase spending and this could have an impact on sales and profitability 

large multinational customers and increasingly midsized customers may limit the number of their suppliers giving those that remain on “core lists” priority for new or modified products to compete more successfully in this environment we must continue to make investments in customer relationships and tailor product research and development in order to anticipate customers’ needs provide effective service and secure and maintain inclusion on certain “core lists” if we are unable to do so it could adversely impact our future results of operations 

our success depends on attracting and retaining talented people within our business significant shortfalls in recruitment or retention could adversely affect our ability to compete and achieve our strategic goals 

attracting developing and retaining talented employees including our perfumers and flavorists is essential to the successful delivery of our products and success in the marketplace competition for these employees can 

  

be intense the ability to attract and retain talented employees is critical in the development of new products and technologies which is an integral component of our growth strategy however we may not be able to attract and retain such employees in the future if we experience significant shortfalls in recruitment or retention our ability to effectively compete with our competitors and to grow our business could be adversely affected 

our reliance on a limited base of suppliers may result in a disruption to our business 

for certain raw materials we rely on a limited number of suppliers and we may not have readily available alternatives if we are unable to maintain our supplier arrangements and relationships and are unable to obtain the quantity quality and price levels needed for our business or if any of our key suppliers becomes insolvent or experiences other financial distress we could experience disruptions in production and our financial results could be adversely affected 

a disruption in operations or our supply chain could adversely affect our business and financial results 

as a company engaged in development manufacturing and distribution on a global scale we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities including industrial accidents environmental events strikes and other labor disputes disruptions in supply chain or information systems loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites product quality control safety licensing requirements and other regulatory issues as well as natural disasters and other external factors over which we have no control if any of these events were to occur it could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results in addition while we have manufacturing facilities throughout the world certain of our facilities are the sole manufacturer of a specific ingredient if the manufacture of that ingredient were disrupted the cost of relocating or replacing the production of an ingredient or reformulating a product may be substantial which could have an adverse effect on our operating results 

our results may be negatively impacted by the outcome of uncertainties related to litigation 

we are involved in a number of legal claims and litigation including claims related to indirect taxes we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of such litigation in addition we cannot provide assurance that future events will not result in an increase in the number of claims or require an increase in the amount accrued for any such claims or require accrual for one or more claims that has not been previously accrued 

our future success depends on our ability to achieve our longterm strategy 

achieving our longterm objectives will require investment in product innovation and expanding our presence in emerging markets these investments may result in shortterm costs without any current revenues and therefore may be dilutive to our earnings at least in the short term in addition as part of our strategy to maximize the economic profitability of our product portfolio we may employ various strategies including increasing pricing implementing cost reduction or containment measures or phasing out low margin products we may not realize in full or in part the anticipated benefits of our strategy and we may incur costs or special charges related to our strategy the failure to realize benefits which may be due to our inability to execute plans global or local economic conditions competition changes in our industry and the other risks described herein could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the level of returns on pension and postretirement plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used for valuation purposes could affect our earnings and cash flows in future periods changes in government regulations could also affect our pension and postretirement plan expenses and funding requirements 

the funding obligations for our pension plans are impacted by the performance of the financial markets particularly the equity markets and interest rates funding obligations are determined under government regulations and are measured each year based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date if the financial markets do not provide the longterm returns that are expected under the governmental funding calculations we could be required to make larger contributions the equity markets can be and recently have been very volatile and therefore our estimate of future contribution requirements can change dramatically in 

  

relatively short periods of time similarly changes in interest rates and legislation enacted by governmental authorities can impact the timing and amounts of contribution requirements an adverse change in the funded status of the plans could significantly increase our required contributions in the future and adversely impact our liquidity 

assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans are determined by us in consultation with outside consultants and advisors in the event that we determine that changes are warranted in the assumptions used such as the discount rate expected longterm rate of return on assets or expected health care costs our future pension and postretirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease due to changing market conditions or changes in the participant population the assumptions that we use may differ from actual results which could have a significant impact on our pension and postretirement liabilities and related costs and funding requirements 

impairment charges on our longlived assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

future events may occur that would adversely affect the reported value of our longlived assets and require impairment charges such events may include but are not limited to strategic decisions made in response to changes in economic and competitive conditions the impact of the economic environment on our sales and our relationship with significant customers or business partners or a sustained decline in our stock price we continue to evaluate the impact of economic and other developments on our business to assess whether impairment indicators are present accordingly we may perform impairment tests more frequently than annually required based on changes in the economic environment and other factors and these tests could result in impairment charges in the future 

our financial results may be adversely impacted by the failure to successfully execute acquisitions collaborations and joint ventures 

from time to time we may evaluate potential acquisitions collaborations or joint ventures that align with our strategic objectives the success of such activity depends in part upon our ability to identify suitable buyers or partners perform effective assessments prior to contract execution negotiate contract terms and if applicable obtain government approval these activities may present certain financial managerial and operational risks including diversion of management’s attention from existing core businesses difficulties integrating or separating businesses from existing operations including employee integration and challenges presented by acquisitions collaborations or joint ventures which may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made if the acquisitions collaborations or joint ventures are not successfully implemented or completed there could be a negative impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our results of operations may be negatively affected by the impact of currency fluctuation or devaluation in the international markets in which we operate 

our operations are conducted in many countries the results of which are reported in the local currency and then translated into us dollars at applicable exchange rates the exchange rates between these currencies and the us dollar have fluctuated and will continue to do so in the future volatility in currency exchange rates may materially adversely impact our reported results of operations financial condition or liquidity we employ a variety of techniques to reduce the impact of exchange rate fluctuations including sourcing strategies and a limited number of foreign currency hedging activities however if our hedging and risk management strategies are not effective our results of operations could be adversely affected 

changes in our tax rates the adoption of new us or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our future results 

we are subject to taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes 

  

in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in liabilities for uncertain tax positions cost of repatriations or changes in tax laws or their interpretation in addition the current administration and congress have announced proposals for new us tax legislation that if adopted could adversely affect our tax rate any of these changes could have a material adverse effect on our profitability we are also subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and foreign tax authorities in those countries in which we operate in particular we are currently involved in tax disputes with the spanish tax authorities regarding certain tax positions taken in our spanish subsidiaries’ tax returns and anticipate that we will receive additional assessments for matters similar to those under appeal we are disputing the pending tax assessments and intend to dispute any future tax assessment that challenges these same tax positions the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of a tax audit or related litigation could have a material effect on our income tax provision net income or cash flows in the period or periods in which that determination is made 

our operations may be affected by greenhouse emissions and climate change and related regulations 

the availability of raw materials and energy supplies fluctuate in markets throughout the world climate change may also affect the availability and price of key raw materials including natural products used in the manufacture of our products in order to mitigate the risk of price increases and shortages our purchasers have developed various sourcing strategies including multiple suppliers inventory management systems various geographic suppliers and longterm agreements to mitigate risk 

in addition to market forces there are various regulatory efforts relating to climate change that may increase the cost of raw materials particularly energy used to operate our facilities that could materially impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

information technology system failures or interruptions or breaches of our network security may interrupt our operations subject us to increased operating costs and expose us to litigation 

we have information systems that support our business processes including product formulas product development sales order processing production distribution finance and intracompany communications throughout the world these systems may be susceptible to outages due to fire floods power loss telecommunications failures breakins and similar events in addition our systems may be vulnerable to computer viruses computer hacking and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering the occurrence of these or other events could interrupt our operations subject us to increased operating costs and expose us to litigation

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend patent claims 

in may 2006 mane fils sa filed a complaint against the company in the us district court for the district of new jersey alleging that the company infringed us patent nos 5725856 and 5843466 that relate to a cooling additive in food and beverage products the complaint was subsequently amended to also assert claims for violations of the lanham act tortious interference and unfair competition the company answered both the original complaint and the amended complaint by denying liability and asserting that both patents were invalid and various other defenses in connection with the claims the plaintiff sought i monetary damages ii punitive damages iii injunctive relief with respect to the patent claims and iv fees costs and interest on december 29 2011 the company settled all patent and nonpatent claims pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement the company paid mane a onetime royalty of approximately 40 million in addition the company agreed to cease making or selling cooler 1 products and to ensure that the monomenthyl succinate mms content of its cooler 2 ® products going forward is at a level that has been agreed upon by both parties 

tax claims 

the company is currently involved in administrative and legal proceedings that relate to tax deductions taken in its spanish subsidiaries’ tax returns which are being challenged by the spanish tax authorities as a result of tax audits the spanish tax authorities imposed tax assessments on the company’s spanish subsidiaries in the amounts of euro 231 299 million for fiscal years 20022003 and euro 616 796 million for fiscal years 20042006 in addition to the disallowance of tax deductions the tax authorities are also asserting tax avoidance arising from the same facts during 2007 and 2008 we filed appeals against the 20022003 tax assessments and related tax avoidance claim with the central economicadministrative tribunal “teac” in spain in march 2010 the teac affirmed the 20022003 tax assessments and related claim and in january 2011 the company filed an appeal for judicial review with the spanish national appellate court during 2011 we filed appeals with the teac against the 20042006 tax assessment and related tax avoidance claim the teac has not yet ruled on such appeals in january 2012 the spanish tax authorities notified the company of their intent to audit the 20072010 tax returns of our spanish subsidiaries the tax positions that have previously been challenged by the spanish tax authorities were consistently taken in our spanish subsidiaries’ tax returns from 2002 through the end of 2011 consequently the company anticipates that it will receive an assessment for matters similar to those under appeal for the fiscal years 20072011 in 2012 the company has reorganized its business operations in spain and the netherlands and therefore the company anticipates that substantially all of the challenged tax deductions previously taken will no longer be applicable in future tax returns of its spanish subsidiaries the company continues to dispute the pending tax assessments and intends to dispute any future tax assessment that challenges these same tax positions 

in addition to the above the company is also a party to four dividend withholding tax controversies in spain alleging that the company’s spanish subsidiaries underpaid withholding taxes which are at different stages of administrative and judicial review spanning fiscal years 19952001 in the aggregate amount of euro 181 million 234 million the company expects that two of these cases aggregating euro 123 159 million will be decided by the spanish supreme court during the first half of 2012 the company obtained a favorable ruling at the lower court in one of these cases and the spanish tax authorities have appealed to the spanish supreme court the company has appealed the other case to the spanish supreme court as it obtained an unfavorable ruling at the lower court 

if the aforementioned tax assessments are ultimately resolved against the company the resulting increase in its liability for uncertain tax positions could have a material effect on the company’s results of operations and cash flows in a particular period 

  

environmental 

over the past 20 years various federal and state authorities and private parties have claimed that the company is a potentially responsible party “prp” as a generator of waste materials for alleged pollution at a number of waste sites operated by third parties located principally in new jersey and have sought to recover costs incurred and to be incurred to clean up the sites 

the company has been identified as a prp at ten facilities operated by third parties at which investigation andor remediation activities may be ongoing the company analyzes its liability on at least a quarterly basis the company accrues for environmental liabilities when they are probable and estimable the company estimates its share of the total future cost for these sites to be less than 5 million 

while joint and several liability is authorized under federal and state environmental laws the company believes the amounts it has paid and anticipates paying in the future for cleanup costs and damages at all sites are not and will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity this assessment is based upon among other things the involvement of other prps at most sites the status of the proceedings including various settlement agreements and consent decrees the extended time period over which payments will likely be made and an agreement reached in july 1994 with three of the company’s liability insurers pursuant to which defense costs and indemnity amounts payable by the company in respect of the sites will be shared by the insurers up to an agreed amount there can be no assurance however that future events will not require us to materially increase the amounts we anticipate paying for cleanup costs and damages at these sites 

other 

the company is also a party to other litigation arising in the ordinary course of business the company does not expect the outcome of these cases singly or in the aggregate to have a material effect on its financial condition results of operations or liquidity

overview 

we create manufacture and supply flavors and fragrances for the food beverage personal care and householdproducts industries our flavors and fragrances are individual ingredients or compounds of a large number of ingredients that are blended mixed or reacted together to produce proprietary formulas created by our perfumers and flavorists 

flavors are the key building blocks that impart taste in processed food and beverage products and play a significant role in determining consumer preference of the end products in which they are used while we are a global leader our flavors business is regional in nature with different formulas that reflect local tastes and ingredients as a leading creator of flavors we help our customers deliver on the promise of delicious and healthy foods and drinks that appeal to consumers our flavors business is divided into four categories of products 1 savory 2 beverages 3 sweet pharmaceutical and oral care “sweet” and 4 dairy 

our fragrances are a key component in the world’s finest perfumes and bestknown consumer brands including beauty care fabric care personal wash and home care products our fragrances business is divided into three categories of products 1 fine fragrance and beauty care 2 functional fragrances and 3 fragrance ingredients 

development of new flavors and fragrances is driven by a variety of sources including requests from our customers who are in need of a specific flavor or fragrance for use in a new or modified consumer product or as a result of internal initiatives stemming from our consumer insights program our product development team works in partnership with our scientists and researchers to optimize the consumer appeal of the flavor or fragrance it then becomes a collaborative process between our researchers our product development team and our customers to perfect the flavor or fragrance so that it is ready to be included in the final consumer product 

our top 25 customers comprised 53 of total sales in 2011 these percentages have remained fairly constant for several years a key factor for commercial success is inclusion on the strategic customers’ core supplier lists opening opportunities to win new business we are on the core supplier lists of a large majority of our strategic customers 

growth in the global flavors and fragrances market is generally aligned with global population trends gdp growth and gains in per capita disposable income the flavor and fragrance market is estimated to be approximately 16 – 17 billion however the exact size of the global market is not available due to fragmentation of data the top four companies are estimated to comprise approximately 70 of the total estimated sales in the global flavors and fragrances subsegment of the broader market 

leveraging our balanced portfolio of business categories and geographic diversity sales in 2011 grew 6 on a reported basis and 4 in local currency lc terms in spite of the market and macroeconomic challenges we faced flavors continued to achieve strong lc growth of 9 for the full year 2011 the flavors growth more than offset a 1 decline in lc sales for our fragrances business the lc decline for fragrances reflects very challenging comparable performance in 2010 with record lc growth of 16 market weakness in discretionary categories primarily fine fragrances and price driven volumes declines in ingredients overall our 2011 results continued to be driven by our strong emerging market presence that represented 46 of total sales and experienced 8 lc growth in 2011 from a geographic perspective all four regions delivered lc growth in 2011 led by greater asia which now represents our second largest region with 6 lc growth 

  

2011 sales by business unit 

 

 

 financial performance overview 

reported sales for 2011 increased 6 yearoveryear as both flavors and fragrances benefited from new business performance and price increases that more than offset price driven volume declines in ingredients and volume erosion in fragrance compounds exchange rate variations accounted for 2 of the yearoveryear sales increase the effect of exchange rates can vary by business and region depending upon the mix of sales by destination country as well as the relative percentage of local sales priced in us dollars versus local currencies lc sales growth of 4 in 2011 was consistent with our longterm strategic target of 4 – 6 growth despite the record lc growth achieved in 2010 of 13 for 2012 we believe that our lc growth will be towards the low end of our longterm target as global gdp growth is expected to be relatively weak we will experience a much larger drag on flavor sales growth in 2012 as compared to 2011 associated with the exiting of underperforming business and demand in ingredients is still expected to be weak in particular lc growth in the first quarter of 2012 will be especially challenged given that this was the strongest quarter during 2011 

on a longterm basis we expect that sales growth for the industry will generally be in line with the underlying assumptions that support our long term strategic goals albeit with some risk in the near term given the continuing global economic uncertainty changing social habits resulting from increased disposable income improved focus on personal health and wellness awareness should help drive growth of our consumer product customers’ business especially in the emerging markets we have targeted such as india and china 

gross margins were down yearoveryear as higher raw material costs more than offset the benefits from price increases realized during the course of 2011 operational improvements in flavors and the benefits associated with the european fragrance rationalization we expect to continue to see yearoveryear increases in raw material costs especially in the early part of 2012 as we are comparing to the lowest levels of 2011 while we made progress during the course of 2011 in compensating for higher input costs through price increases there was a substantial gap for the realization of these increases primarily within fragrances we will continue to pursue additional price realization and other cost savings initiatives in 2012 that should enable us to offset the pricing gap over the course of the year 

operating profit increased 114 million to 4277 million 153 of sales in 2011 compared to 4164 million 159 of sales we were able to compensate for the significant gross margin pressure in 2011 by maintaining a strict cost discipline including the benefits associated with lower incentive compensation as a 

  

result adjusted operating profit excluding the effects of restructuring charges in 2011 and 2010 and the mane patent litigation settlement in 2011 increased 480 million to 4744 million 170 of sales in 2011 as compared to 4264 million 163 of sales in 2010 

in december 2011 we recorded a charge to cover a restructuring which involved a reduction in workforce across fragrances flavors and corporate functions as well as a realignment of responsibilities in our fragrances business unit we expect to realize approximately 90 million in savings during 2012 as a result of this restructuring initiative the savings generated will principally benefit the functional fragrance activities within the company this category was one of the improvement opportunities identified during our 2010 strategic assessment process 

despite the nearterm challenges we faced during 2011 we continued to execute against the strategic priorities identified during our 2010 assessment in particular ensuring that we have adequate resources and capabilities in place to support planned growth in emerging markets through investments and key technologies was the primary driver within the 127 million 46 of sales of capital spending during 2011 in 2012 we again expect capital spending to approach 5 as we continue to prioritize investments in emerging markets and flavors 

cash flows from operations were 1892 million or 68 of sales in 2011 as compared to 3151 million or 12 of sales during 2010 the decrease in cash generation was primarily driven by the yearoveryear impact of incentive compensation payments and accruals a 400 million patent litigation settlement payment in the fourth quarter and higher tax payments in 2011 associated with the strong 2010 results

cost of goods sold includes the cost of materials and manufacturing expenses raw materials generally constitute 700 of the total rd expenses relate to the development of new and improved products technical product support and compliance with governmental regulations sa expenses include expenses necessary to support our commercial activities and administrative expenses principally associated with staff groups that support our overall operating activities 

2011 in comparison to 2010 

s ales 

sales for 2011 totaled 28 billion an increase of 6 from the prior year excluding currency impacts lc sales grew by 4 driven principally by new business and the realization of price increases that were implemented to mitigate the effects of higher raw material costs lc sales growth was primarily driven by the realization of price increases across both business units while new win performance was largely offset by volume declines in the second half of 2011 mainly in fragrances overall lc growth was driven by 8 growth in the emerging markets 

flavors business unit 

on a reported basis flavor sales increased 12 excluding the impact of foreign currency lc sales for the flavors business increased 9 versus the prior year period the increase was driven by new business with our customers followed by the realization of price increases and growth in the underlying demand for our customers’ products sales growth in 2011 includes the impact of exiting approximately 6 million of less profitable nonstrategic business lc growth was led by doubledigit gains in savory and beverages and single digit gains in sweet confectionery all of which benefited from new business higher volumes and realization of price increases regionally the business benefited from double digit growth in noam and eame whereas ga had highsingle digit lc growth the improvement in eame reflects growth in all categories led by near or doubledigit gains in savory beverage and sweet eame performance continues to be led by our performance in the emerging market countries within the region sales in noam were led by doubledigit gains in savory and beverage lc growth in ga was driven by doubledigit gains in beverages and dairy followed by high singledigit gains in sweet la lc growth of 4 was driven by doubledigit gains in sweet and dairy as well as midsingle digit growth in savory globally flavors growth was led by doubledigit growth in emerging markets 

fragrances business unit 

the fragrances business experienced a 1 increase in reported sales and was down 1 in lc terms compared to 16 lc sales growth during 2010 new business wins and the realization of price increases were more than offset by declines in existing business most notably in ingredients and fine fragrances yearoveryear 2011 lc sales performance was led by doubledigit growth in home care along with low singledigit gains in beauty care and fabric care categories offsetting these gains was a 9 decline in ingredients compared to an 18 increase during 2010 lc growth within the regions was led by ga at 2 mainly due to new business and slightly higher volumes notably within the fabric care which had doubledigit lc gains all other regions were flat to slightly down reflecting gains in hair care and home care that were largely offset by volume erosion in fine fragrances in north america as well as declines in ingredients in all regions global growth was led by singledigit growth in emerging markets which represented more than 40 of total fragrance sales 

  

sales performance by region and category 

 

  

  

  

  

 cost of goods sold 

cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales increased 210 basis points bps to 604 in 2011 compared to 583 in 2010 the increase versus last year was mainly driven by higher raw material costs combined with a slightly less favorable sales mix overall raw material costs have increased approximately 10 on a yearoveryear basis these effects were partially offset by improved operating leverage ongoing margin recovery efforts in both businesses including pricing and benefits associated with the european rationalization that was completed in late 2010 

research and development rd 

rd expenses increased approximately 10 million versus the prior year as investments in technology and innovation were largely offset by lower provisions for incentive compensation overall rd expenses decreased 40 bps as a percentage of sales from 83 in 2010 to 79 in 2011 

selling and administrative sa 

sa as a percentage of sales decreased 120 bps to 159 versus 171 the 2011 amount includes 335 million related to the mane patent litigation settlement excluding this amount sa would have declined 240 

  

bps to 147 of sales the decrease in sa expenses was driven by lower provisions for incentive compensation and ongoing cost discipline that more than offset planned spend in sales activities mainly in emerging markets to support our growth initiatives 

restructuring and other charges 

restructuring and other charges primarily consist of separation costs for employees including severance outplacement and other benefit costs 

 

 strategic initiative 

in december 2011 we recorded a charge to cover a restructuring which involved a reduction in workforce as well as a realignment of responsibilities in our fragrances business unit this alignment partly addresses issues identified in our 2010 strategic review process towards improving the underperforming areas of our portfolio it will result in the redeployment of creative resources in emerging markets and the reorganization from a regional to a global category structure we implemented a plan to streamline business operations globally which resulted in the elimination of 72 positions across fragrances flavors and corporate functions as a result we recorded a provision for severance costs of 98 million to restructuring and other charges net in our 2011 consolidated statement of income we expect to realize pretax savings of approximately 90 million in 2012 

european rationalization plan 

during the second quarter 2011 we executed a partial settlement of its pension obligations with the former employees of the drogheda facility as a result we recorded a charge of 39 million related to the european rationalization plan to cover settlements and special termination benefits this settlement was funded primarily through pension plan investment trust assets 

we also reversed 12 million of employeerelated liabilities in 2011 due to certain employees accepting other roles within the company offset by 06 million of additional costs incurred 

based upon the periodend estimates regarding the separation agreements we increased our provision for severance costs in by 44 million in 2010 the remaining 57 million of the restructuring charges in 2010 was mainly due to accelerated depreciation and other restructuring related costs pertaining to the rationalization of our fragrances and ingredients operations in europe 

in the aggregate as of december 31 2011 we have recorded expenses of 341 million relating to the european rationalization plan and 98 million for the strategic initiative of which 376 million was recorded to restructuring and other charges net and 63 million recorded to cost of goods sold rd and selling and administrative expenses we do not anticipate any further expenses related to the european rationalization plan 

operating results by business unit 

we evaluate the performance of business units based on adjusted operating profit before restructuring and certain nonrecurring adjustments before interest expense other expense net and taxes on income see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for the reconciliation to income before taxes 

  

 

  

 flavors business unit 

flavors operating profit totaled 2493 million in 2011 185 of sales compared to 2425 million 202 of sales in the comparable 2010 period flavors adjusted operating profit increased 417 million to 2842 million 211 of sales the improvement in profitability was mainly driven by strong sales growth and increased operating leverage the realization of price increases and margin improvement initiatives that more than offset the effects of higher raw material costs and less favorable sales mix 

fragrances business unit 

fragrances operating profit totaled 2153 million in 2011 or 149 as a percentage of sales compared to 2349 million or 165 as a percentage of sales reported in 2010 fragrances adjusted operating profit decreased 184 million to 2266 million 157 of sales versus 2450 million 173 of sales during 2010 the decline in profit was driven by sharply higher input costs and weaker sales mix that could only be partially offset by the realization of price increases the benefits of the european restructuring other margin improvement initiatives and lower incentive compensation 

global expenses 

global expenses represent corporate and headquartersrelated expenses which include legal finance human resources and rd and other administrative expenses that are not allocated to an individual business unit in 2011 global expenses were 369 million compared to 611 million during 2010 the decline principally reflects lower incentive compensation 

interest expense 

in 2011 interest expense decreased 41 million to 446 million the decrease in interest expense reflects lower levels of outstanding debt mainly due to 1237 million of longterm debt repayments in 2011 average cost of debt was 47 for the 2011 period compared to 50 in 2010 

other expense net 

other expense net increased approximately 14 million to 95 million in 2011 versus 81 million in 2010 the change was driven by higher foreign exchange losses on outstanding working capital balances principally associated with a general weakening of the us dollar 

  

income taxes 

the effective tax rate was 286 in 2011 as compared to a rate of 267 in the prior year the current period included a 58 million adjustment of deferred tax assets as a result of us state law changes enacted during the second quarter 2011 and a low effective tax rate on the mane patent litigation settlement 

2010 in comparison to 2009 

sales 

sales for 2010 totaled 26 billion an increase of 13 from 23 billion in 2009 the significant acceleration of growth 13 in lc terms reflects strong commercial performance in both businesses higher volumes including the effects of restocking in developed markets most notably in the first half of the year and stronger sales mix for both businesses sales from new wins accounted for half of the lc sales gains in addition higher volumes were driven by a broadbased recovery in demand and lower base period comparisons in 2009 primarily in fine fragrances ingredients and home care foreign currency movements had only a minor impact on yearoveryear sales growth although there was volatility from quartertoquarter 

flavors business unit 

on a reported basis flavor sales increased 11 excluding the impact of foreign currency translation lc sales for the flavors business increased 10 from the prior year period almost 60 of yearoveryear gain was driven by higher volume including some elements of restocking with the remaining due to sales from new business solid growth was experienced across all product categories led by doubledigit lc growth in our beverage and sweet categories and near doubledigit growth in the others our regional growth was driven by eame and ga which benefited from result of higher volumes and net new business particularly in the beverage sweet and savory categories growth in both regions benefited from continued investments to strengthen our commercial and development capabilities sales in noam were up 6 due to higher volume and new business in beverages and sweet la had solid growth up 6 in lc as new business wins and volume recovery in sweet and savory more than offset the effects of nonstrategic business lost last year overall growth was led by solid doubledigit growth in emerging markets of 14 which represent 47 of flavors overall sales 

fragrances business unit 

fragrance sales increased significantly up 14 on a reported basis and 16 in lc terms approximately 60 of the improvement was driven by sales from new wins with our customers with the balance attributable to increased volume including the benefit of weaker prior year base sales in fine fragrance and ingredients the volume gains reflect a bounce back in demand supported by increased customer promotional activities mainly in fine fragrance lower base period comparisons and restocking in the developed markets overall fine  beauty care lc sales increased 26 versus last year driven by significant gains in new business a recovery in demand including effects of restocking and low prior year activity levels lc functional fragrance sales increased 7 driven by doubledigit gains in home care resulting from new business and solid growth in our fabric care category ingredient lc sales increased 18 driven by a recovery in demand weaker yearago activity and customer success within certain specialty grades all regions delivered doubledigit lc sales gains led by la fine  beauty and ingredients and eame fine fragrance and functional ga growth was led by strong functional and hair care category sales whereas noam was mainly driven by higher fine fragrance sales overall growth was wellbalanced with both emerging and developed markets delivering doubledigit lc gains although emerging market growth was strongest at 18

 cost of goods sold 

cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales decreased to 583 in 2010 compared to 598 during 2009 the improvement in 2010 versus the prior year period reflects favorable input costs combined with better absorption resulting from higher volumes continued margin recovery efforts and a stronger sales mix this improvement was partially offset by inventory writeoffs and transition costs associated with the rationalization of our fragrance and ingredients’ operations in europe 

  

research and development rd 

rd expenses increased approximately 340 million from the prior year the increase was due to growth driven incentive compensation accruals of 150 million and lower rd tax credits of 50 million the remaining increase was due to higher basic research targeted investments to support strategic growth initiatives and lower prior period base comparison resulting from some curtailment in 2009 spend due to the then prevailing economic crisis 

selling and administrative sa 

sa as a percentage of sales increased slightly to 171 of sales compared to 168 for 2009 overall spending increased 565 million versus the prior year mainly driven by higher provisions for incentive compensation of 360 million the remaining variance was due to planned investments and volume related activity to support growth contingency related costs and fees and lower prior period base spending in 2009 due to the prevailing economic crisis the 2009 results include approximately 60 million of severance and related costs primarily associated with a change in our chief executive officer 

restructuring and other charges 

 

 european rationalization plan 

in 2009 as part of the rationalization of our european fragrance manufacturing footprint the company decided to close its fragrances compounding facility in drogheda ireland as well as the partial closure of its fragrance ingredients plant in haverhill united kingdom the company recorded 122 million of severance costs and 10 million of accelerated depreciation on certain related assets and other restructuring related costs in addition as part of the continued focus to optimize our european operations the flavors segment recorded a provision for severance costs of 10 million 

the company has completed its negotiations with the drogheda ireland employee representatives regarding separation benefits related to the closure of the company’s compounding facility at that location during the third quarter 2010 based upon the periodend estimates regarding the separation agreements the company increased its provision for severance costs by 44 million in 2010 the remaining 57 million of the restructuring charges in 2010 was mainly due to accelerated depreciation and other restructuring related costs pertaining to the rationalization of our fragrances and ingredients operations in europe the company ceased its operations at the drogheda plant as of september 30 2010 

performance improvement plan 

in 2009 we provided another 66 million for severance and related costs associated with the elimination of approximately 70 additional positions globally subsequently there was a 25 million reduction in previously recorded provisions due to lower estimated benefit costs on severance paid as well as fewer position eliminations requiring severance

global expenses represent corporate and headquartersrelated expenses which include legal finance human resources and other administrative expenses that are not allocated to an individual business unit in 2010 global expenses were 611 million compared to 386 million during 2009 the increase in global expenses is mainly due to higher incentive compensation of 220 million with the balance mainly related to litigation related provisions and costs in 2009 global expenses included 63 million of employee separation costs associated with the change in our chief executive officer 

  

interest expense 

during 2010 interest expense totaled 487 million compared to 618 million in 2009 the 2009 amount includes 40 million of interest paid on the closeout of a crosscurrency interest rate swap classified as a net investment hedge the additional reduction versus 2009 reflects certain debt repayments of 2011 million made during the second half of 2009 average cost of debt was 50 for the 2010 period compared to 55 in 2009 

other expense net 

other expense was 81 million in 2010 versus 19 million in 2009 approximately 50 of which relates to losses on foreign exchange transactions the remaining change is principally attributable to higher provisions for noncontrolling interest in consolidated subsidiaries and miscellaneous nonoperating expenses 

income taxes 

the effective tax rate for the year 2010 was 267 compared to 293 during 2009 the yearoveryear decrease reflects the mix of earnings across the countries in which the company operates an adjustment to provisions for tax reserves and lower repatriation costs the 2009 results include 6 million of tax expense due to the recognition of outofperiod tax adjustments arising from periods 2006 and prior and was also impacted by the higher level of restructuring costs which carried lower tax benefits 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash and cash equivalents 

we had cash and cash equivalents of 883 million at december 31 2011 compared to 1313 million at december 31 2010 of which 763 million of the balance at december 31 2011 was held outside the united states cash balances held in foreign jurisdictions are in most circumstances available to be repatriated to the united states however they would be subject to united states federal income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits we have not provided us income tax expense on earnings in excess of current year earnings of our foreign subsidiaries because we intend and plan to reinvest the undistributed earnings indefinitely 

effective utilization of the cash generated by our international operations is a critical component of our tax strategy strategic dividend repatriation from foreign subsidiaries creates us taxable income which enables us to realize deferred tax assets the company regularly repatriates in the form of dividends from its nonus subsidiaries a portion of its current year earnings to fund financial obligations in the us these repatriations of current year earnings totaled 1195 million 3605 million and 1505 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

cash flows from operating activities 

operating cash flows in 2011 were 1892 million compared to 3151 million and 2916 million in 2010 and 2009 respectively the cash flow impact associated with core working capital trade receivables plus inventories less accounts payable was flat compared to 2010 the decrease in operating cash flows from 2010 reflects higher incentive compensation payments made in 2011 as a result of strong 2010 performance the mane patent litigation settlement of 40 million and higher tax payments 

working capital current assets less current liabilities totaled 7527 million at yearend 2011 compared to 6642 million at december 31 2010 the 2011 increase in working capital reflects higher commercial activity significant increases in input costs and lower provisions for incentive compensation 

as of december 31 2011 net trade receivables increased by 205 million as compared to december 31 2010 principally related to higher sales levels during the fourth quarter 2011 versus the fourth quarter 2010 

  

cash flows used in investing activities 

additions to property plant and equipment were 1275 million 1063 million and 668 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively and are expected to approximate 5 of sales in 2012 the increase in additions versus last year reflects planned investments in capacity and new technologies mainly in the emerging markets 

net investing activities in 2011 utilized 1312 million compared to 1068 million and 809 million in 2010 and 2009 respectively the increase in investing activities in 2011 resulted from higher additions to property plant and equipment to grow in emerging markets 

cash flows used in financing activities 

net financing activities in 2011 used 1007 million compared to 1567 million and 3122 million in 2010 and 2009 respectively the decrease from 2010 reflects longterm debt repayments in 2011 of 1237 million compared to none in 2010 slightly offset by net credit facility borrowings in 2011 of 927 million compared to net credit facility payments of 1032 million in 2010 

at december 31 2011 we had 8949 million of debt outstanding compared to 9216 million outstanding at december 31 2010 

in february 2009 we terminated a 3000 million usd libor to euribor interest rate swap which required us to make a payment of 160 million see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding these transactions 

we paid dividends totaling 903 million 812 million and 788 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively the cash dividend declared per share in 2011 2010 and 2009 was 116 104 and 100 respectively 

capital resources 

operating cash flow provides the primary source of funds for capital investment needs dividends paid to shareholders and debt repayments we anticipate that cash flows from operations and availability under our existing credit facilities are sufficient to meet our investing and financing needs for at least the next eighteen months we regularly assess our capital structure including both current and longterm debt instruments as compared to our cash generation and investment needs in order to provide ample flexibility 

we supplement shortterm liquidity with access to capital markets mainly through bank credit facilities and issuance of commercial paper we did not issue commercial paper during 2011 and 2010 

on november 9 2011 iff including certain subsidiaries entered into a new credit agreement with citibank na as administrative agent and the other lenders agents arrangers and bookrunners to replace the previous credit agreement set to expire november 23 2012 the credit agreement provides for a revolving loan facility in an aggregate amount up to an equivalent of 9420 million the “new facility” there are three tranches under the new facility the tranche a facility is available to all of the borrowers other than iff spain in us dollars euros swiss francs japanese yen and british sterling in an aggregate amount up to an equivalent of 458 million and contains sublimits of 250 million for letters of credit and 500 million for swing line borrowings the tranche b facility is available to all of the borrowers in euros swiss francs japanese yen and british sterling in an aggregate amount up to an equivalent of 3540 million and contains sublimits of €250 million for letters of credit and €500 million for swing line borrowings the tranche c facility is available to all of the borrowers in euros only in an aggregate amount up to €100505400 the new facility will be available for general corporate purposes of each borrower and its subsidiaries the obligations under the new facility are unsecured and the company has guaranteed the obligations of each other borrower under the new facility the new facility will mature on november 9 2016 but may be extended for up to two additional oneyear periods at the company’s request subject to the agreement of the lenders having commitments 

  

representing more than 50 of the aggregate commitments of all lenders under the new facility borrowings under the new facility bear interest at an annual rate of libor plus a margin currently 125 bps linked to our credit rating the interest rate under the new facility at december 31 2011 was 177 the new facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants including the requirement for us to maintain at the end of each fiscal quarter a ratio of net debt for borrowed money to adjusted ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization in respect of the previous 12month period of not more than 325 to 1 we have complied with this covenant at all times 

the new facility provides us with access to approximately 80 million of additional borrowings compared to the old facility the margin added to the annual rate of libor is currently 100 bps higher than the old facility such increase has not caused a material change to our cost of borrowing 

as of december 31 2011 we had total borrowings under the new facility of 1575 million the amount which we are able to draw down on under the agreement is limited by financial covenants as described in more detail below at december 31 2011 we had a remaining overall borrowing capacity of 10280 million however our drawdown capacity on the new facility was limited to 7845 million based on existing balances outstanding under the facility at december 31 2011 the company did not have any letters of credit outstanding under the new facility as of december 31 2011 

the facility contains the most restrictive covenant of all of our debt requiring us to maintain at the end of each fiscal quarter a ratio of net debt for borrowed money to adjusted ebitda in respect of the previous 12month period of not more than 325 to 1 

at december 31 2011 and 2010 we were in compliance with all financial and other covenants at december 31 2011 our net debtadjusted ebitda 1 was 142 to 1 as defined by the debt agreements well below the financial covenants of existing outstanding debt failure to comply with the financial and other covenants under these agreements would constitute default and would allow the lenders to accelerate the maturity of all indebtedness under the related agreement if such acceleration were to occur we would not have sufficient liquidity available to repay the indebtedness we would likely have to seek amendments under the agreements for relief from the financial covenants or repay the debt with proceeds from the issuance of new debt or equity andor asset sales if necessary we may be unable to amend the agreements or raise sufficient capital to repay such obligations in the event the maturities are accelerated 

 

  

  

   

   

 compliance with existing governmental requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment has not materially affected our operations earnings or competitive position in 2011 and 2010 we spent 2 million and 6 million respectively on capital projects and 17 million and 18 million respectively in operating expenses and governmental charges for the purpose of complying with such regulations expenditures for these purposes will continue for the foreseeable future in addition we are party to a number of proceedings brought under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act or similar state statutes it is expected that the impact of any judgments in or voluntary settlements of such proceedings will not be material to our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

contractual obligations 

at december 31 2011 we had contractual payment obligations due within the time periods as specified in the following table 

 

  

      

 the table above does not include 68 million of the total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions and approximately 13 million of associated accrued interest due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential cash flows the company is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid 

critical accounting policies and use of estimates 

our accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements as disclosed in note 1 the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and accompanying disclosures these estimates are based on management’s best judgment of current events and actions that we may undertake in the future actual results may ultimately differ from estimates 

those areas requiring the greatest degree of management judgment or deemed most critical to our financial reporting involve 

the periodic assessment of potential impairment of intangible assets acquired in business combinations  we currently have net intangible assets including goodwill of 708 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 we early adopted asu no 20118 “intangibles — goodwill and other topic 350 testing goodwill for impairment” we conduct a goodwill qualitative assessment as of november 30th on an annual basis or more frequently when significant change in circumstances that would be considered a triggering event indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable the goodwill impairment qualitative assessment requires us to perform an assessment for each reporting unit to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we identified two reporting units the flavors reporting unit and the fragrances reporting unit these reporting units were determined based on the level at which the performance is measured and reviewed 

the qualitative assessment considers various factors for each reporting unit including the macroeconomic environment industry and market specific conditions financial performance cost impacts and issues or events specific to the reporting unit if it is determined that it is more likely than not the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of a reporting unit we perform a “step one” goodwill impairment test we completed our annual qualitative assessment of as of november 30 2011 which indicated no impairment of goodwill as it was determined it is more likely than not that the fair values exceed the carrying values of each of our reporting units 

the analysis and evaluation of income taxes we account for taxes under the asset and liability method under this method deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax return bases of assets and liabilities a valuation allowance is recognized if based on the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized the assessment of the need for a valuation allowance requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future earnings reversal of existing temporary differences and available tax planning strategies if actual experience differs from these estimates and assumptions the recorded deferred tax asset may not be fully realized resulting in an increase to income tax expense in our results of operations 

the company has not established deferred tax liabilities for undistributed foreign earnings as it has plans to and intends to indefinitely reinvest those earnings to finance foreign activities however if these earnings become subject to us federal tax any required provision could have a material impact on our financial results 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes we first 

  

determine whether a tax authority would “more likely than not” sustain our tax position if it were to audit the position with full knowledge of all the relevant facts and other information for those tax positions that meet this threshold we measure the amount of tax benefit based on the largest amount of tax benefit that we have a greater than 50 chance of realizing in a final settlement with the relevant authority those tax positions failing to qualify for initial recognition are recognized in the first interim period in which they meet the more likely than not standard or are resolved through negotiation or litigation with the taxing authority or upon expiration of the statute of limitations this evaluation is made at the time that we adopt a tax position and whenever there is new information and is based upon management’s evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date we maintain a cumulative risk portfolio relating to all of our uncertainties in income taxes in order to perform this analysis but the evaluation of our tax positions requires significant judgment and estimation in part because in certain cases tax law is subject to varied interpretation and whether a tax position will ultimately be sustained may be uncertain the actual outcome of our tax positions if significantly different from our estimates could materially impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

the evaluation of potential litigation and environmental liabilities where changing circumstances rules and regulations require regular reassessment of related practices and anticipated costs we are subject to certain legal claims regarding products and other matters as well as environmentalrelated matters significant management judgment is involved in determining when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the extent to which it can be reasonably estimated 

we regularly assess potential liabilities with respect to all legal claims based on the most recent available information in consultation with outside counsel we have engaged on our behalf to handle the defense of such matters to the extent a liability is considered to be probable and reasonably estimable we recognize a corresponding liability if the reasonably estimated liability is a range we recognize that amount considered most likely or in the absence of such a determination the minimum reasonably estimated liability to the extent such claims are covered by various insurance policies we separately evaluate the right to recovery and estimate the related insurance claim receivable management judgments involve determination as to whether a liability has been incurred the reasonably estimated amount of that liability and any potential insurance recovery 

we regularly evaluate potential environmental exposure in terms of total estimated cost and the viability of other potentially responsible parties “prp’s” associated with our exposure recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress and additional information becomes available critical management assumptions relate to expected total costs to remediate and the financial viability of prp’s to share such costs 

determination of the various assumptions employed in the valuation of pension and retiree health care expense and associated obligations amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined from actuarial valuations inherent in such valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets discount rates at which the liabilities could be settled rates of increase in future compensation levels mortality rates and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore affect expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods 

we consider a number of factors in determining and selecting assumptions for the overall expected longterm rate of return on plan assets we consider the historical longterm return experience of our assets the current and expected allocation of our plan assets and expected longterm rates of return we derive these expected longterm rates of return with the assistance of our investment advisors we base our expected allocation of plan assets on a diversified portfolio consisting of domestic and international equity securities fixed income real estate and alternative asset classes 

we consider a variety of factors in determining and selecting our assumptions for the discount rate at december 31 for the us plans the discount rate was based on the internal rate of return for a portfolio of 

  

moody’s aaa aa and merrill lynch aaaaa high quality bonds with maturities that are consistent with the projected future benefit payment obligations of the plan the rate of compensation increase for all plans and the medical cost trend rate for the applicable us plans are based on plan experience 

with respect to the us plans the expected rate of return on plan assets was determined based on an asset allocation model using the current target allocation real rates of return by asset class and an anticipated inflation rate the target asset allocation consists of approximately 50 in equity securities and 50 in fixed income securities the plan has achieved a compounded annual rate of return of 75 over the previous 20 years at december 31 2011 the actual asset allocation was 50 in equity securities 48 in fixed income securities and 2 in cash equivalents 

the expected rate of return for the nonus plans employs a similar set of criteria adapted for local investments inflation rates and in certain cases specific government requirements the target asset allocation for the nonus plans consists of approximately 5560 in fixed income securities 20 25 in equity securities 510 in real estate and 510 in alternative investments at december 31 2011 the actual asset allocation was 59 in fixed income investments 22 in equity investments 10 in real estate investments 8 in alternative investments and 1 in cash and cash equivalents 

changes in pension and other postemployment benefits and associated expenses may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions the impact that a 25 decrease in the discount rate or a 1 change in the medical cost trend rate would have on our pension and other postemployment benefit expense as applicable is as follows 

 

 the effect of a 1 increase in the medical cost trend rate would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and the annual postretirement expense by approximately 81 million and 04 million respectively a 1 decrease in the rate would decrease the obligation and expense by approximately 74 million and 04 million respectively 

the ongoing assessment of the valuation of inventory given the large number of natural ingredients employed the quality of which may be diminished over time we maintain approximately 45 – 50 of our inventory as raw materials providing the greatest degree of flexibility in manufacture and use materials are evaluated based on shelf life known uses and anticipated demand based on forecasted customer order activity and changes in productsales mix management policy provides for an ongoing assessment of inventory with adjustments recorded when an item is deemed to be slow moving or obsolete 

we believe that we have considered relevant circumstances that we may be currently subject to and the financial statements accurately reflect our best estimate of the impact of these items in our results of operations financial condition and cash flows for the years presented we have discussed the decision process and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 

new accounting standards 

in june 2011 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued revised guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income this revised guidance eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income “oci” as part of the consolidated statement of shareholders’ equity and provides two alternatives for presenting the components of net income and oci either i in a single continuous 

  

statement of comprehensive income or ii in two separate but consecutive financial statements consisting of an income statement followed by a separate statement of comprehensive income additionally items that are reclassified from oci to net income must be presented on the face of the financial statements retrospective application will be required and is effective for the company as of the beginning of 2012 in december 2011 the fasb deferred the reclassification requirement of this guidance indefinitely the application of this revised guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements but will result in a change in the presentation of the company’s consolidated statements of income and equity 

in september 2011 the fasb issued authoritative guidance allowing entities the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether or not it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value exceeds the carrying amount an entity does not have to perform step one of the goodwill impairment testing this new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december 15 2011 with early adoption permitted the company has adopted this guidance when it performed its annual goodwill impairment testing during the fourth quarter 2011 adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on the company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations 

nongaap financial measures 

the company uses nongaap financial operating measures which exclude restructuring charges including costs associated with the company’s restructuring efforts in europe in 2009 2010 and 2011 and costs associated with the 2011 strategic initiative employee separation costs in 2009 and the mane patent litigation settlement in 2011 the company also measures sales performance on a nongaap basis which eliminates the effects that result from translating its international sales in us dollars “local currency” such information is supplemental to information presented in accordance with gaap and is not intended to represent a presentation in accordance with gaap in discussing our historical and expected future results and financial condition we believe it is meaningful for investors to be made aware of and to be assisted in a better understanding of on a periodtoperiod comparative basis of financial amounts both including and excluding these identified items as well as the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on operating results and financial condition we believe such additional nongaap information provides investors with an overall perspective of the periodtoperiod performance of our core business in addition management internally reviews each of these nongaap measures to evaluate performance on a comparative periodtoperiod basis in terms of absolute performance trends and expected future performance with respect to our core continuing business a material limitation of these nongaap measures is that such measures do not reflect actual gaap amounts restructuring charges employee separation costs and the patent litigation settlement include actual cash outlays and we compensate for such limitations by presenting the accompanying reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measure these nongaap measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we operate on a global basis and are exposed to currency fluctuation related to the manufacture and sale of our products in currencies other than the us dollar the major foreign currencies involve the markets in the european union great britain mexico brazil china india indonesia australia and japan although all regions are subject to foreign currency fluctuations versus the us dollar we actively monitor our foreign currency exposures in all major markets in which we operate and employ a variety of techniques to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations including foreign currency hedging activities 

we have established a centralized reporting system to evaluate the effects of changes in interest rates currency exchange rates and other relevant market risks our risk management procedures include the monitoring of interest rate and foreign exchange exposures and hedge positions utilizing statistical analyses of cash flows market value and sensitivity analysis however the use of these techniques to quantify the market risk of such instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of their accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions for the year ended december 31 2011 the company’s exposure to market risk was estimated using sensitivity analyses which illustrate the change in the fair value of a derivative financial instrument assuming hypothetical changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts with the objective of reducing exposure to cash flow volatility associated with foreign currency receivables and payables and with anticipated purchases of certain raw materials used in operations these contracts the counterparties to which are major international financial institutions generally involve the exchange of one currency for a second currency at a future date and have maturities not exceeding twelve months the gain or loss on the hedging instrument and services is recorded in earnings at the same time as the transaction being hedged is recorded in earnings at december 31 2011 the company’s foreign currency exposures pertaining to derivative contracts exist with the euro japanese yen british pound indonesia rupiah singapore dollar australian dollar south african rand swedish krona and swiss franc based on a hypothetical decrease or increase of 10 in the applicable balance sheet exchange rates primarily against the us dollar the estimated fair value of the company’s foreign currency forward contracts would increase or decrease by approximately 20 million however any change in the value of the contracts real or hypothetical would be significantly offset by a corresponding change in the value of the underlying hedged items 

we have a japanese yenus dollar currency swap related to monthly sale and purchase of products between the us and japan a hypothetical decrease or increase of 10 in the value of the us dollar against the japanese yen the estimated fair value of the company’s foreign currency forward contracts would not have a material effect 

we have also used nonus dollar borrowings and foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the foreign currency exposures of our net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries primarily in the european union based on a hypothetical decrease or increase of 10 in the value of the us dollar against the euro the estimated fair value of the company’s foreign currency forward contracts would change by approximately 5 million however any change in the value of the contracts real or hypothetical would be significantly offset by a corresponding change in the value of the underlying hedged items 

we use derivative instruments as part of our interest rate risk management strategy the derivative instruments used are comprised principally of fixed to variable rate interest rate swaps based on the libor plus an interest mark up the notional amount interest payment and maturity date of the swaps match the principal interest payment and maturity date of the related debt and the swaps are valued using observable benchmark rates based on a hypothetical decrease or increase of one percentage point in libor the estimated fair value of the company’s interest rate swaps would change by less than 2 million 

at december 31 2011 the fair value of our fixed rate debt was 867 million based on a hypothetical decrease of 10 in interest rates the estimated fair value of the company’s fixed debt would increase by 5 million 

  

we purchase certain commodities such as natural gas electricity petroleum based products and certain crop related items we generally purchase these commodities based upon market prices that are established with the vendor as part of the purchase process in general we do not use commodity financial instruments to hedge commodity prices

products 

our principal fragrance and flavor products consist of compounds of large numbers of ingredients blended in proprietary formulas created by our perfumers and flavorists most of these compounds contribute the total fragrance or flavor to the consumer products in which they are used this fragrance or flavor characteristic is often a major factor in the consumer selection and acceptance of the consumer end product a smaller number of compounds are sold to manufacturers who further blend them to achieve the finished fragrance or flavor in their products we produce thousands of compounds and new compounds are constantly being created in order to meet the many and changing characteristics of our customers’ end products most of the fragrance and flavor compounds are created and produced for the exclusive use of particular customers our products are sold in powder and liquid forms and in amounts ranging from a few pounds to many tons depending upon the nature of the product 

the ingredients that we use in our compounds are both synthetic and natural we manufacture a substantial portion of the synthetic ingredients while a majority of our synthetic ingredients production is used in our compounds a substantial portion is also sold to others natural ingredients are derived from flowers fruits and other botanical products as well as from animal products they contain varying numbers of organic chemicals which are responsible for the fragrance or flavor of the natural product the natural products are purchased in processed or semiprocessed form some are used in compounds in the state in which they are purchased and others after further processing natural products together with various chemicals are also used as raw materials for the manufacture of synthetic ingredients by chemical processes our flavor products also include extracts and seasonings derived from various fruits vegetables nuts herbs and spices as well as microbiologicallyderived ingredients

market developments 

the demand for consumer products utilizing flavors and fragrances has been stimulated and broadened by changing social habits resulting from various factors such as increases in personal income dualearner households teenage population leisure time urbanization health and wellness concerns including increased demand for nature based products and by the continued growth of emerging markets in the fragrance field these developments expanded the market for hair care candles and air care products and deodorant and personal wash products with finer fragrance quality as well as the market for colognes toilet waters men’s toiletries and other products beyond traditional luxury items such as perfumes in the flavor field similar market characteristics stimulated the demand for products such as convenience foods soft drinks and lowfat and organic food products that must conform to expected tastes new and improved methods of packaging applying and dispensing have been developed for many consumer products that utilize some of our flavor or fragrance products these developments called for the creation of new compounds and ingredients compatible with the newly introduced materials and methods of application 

product development and research 

the development of new flavors and fragrances is a complex technical and artistic process calling upon the combined knowledge and skill of our creative perfumers and flavorists and our scientists with extensive experience the perfumers and flavorists continuously advance their skills for creating fragrances or flavors best suited to the market requirements of the customers’ products 

scientists from various disciplines work in project teams with the perfumers and flavorists to develop flavor and fragrance products with consumer preferred performance characteristics scientific expertise includes natural products research plant science organic chemistry analytical chemistry biochemistry microbiology process engineering food science material science and sensory science analytical and sensory science is applied to understand the complex interactions of the many ingredients in a consumer product in order to optimize the flavor or fragrance performance at all points of use material science technology is applied to create controlled release and delivery systems to enhance flavor and fragrance performance in consumer products an important contribution to the creation of new flavor and fragrances is the discovery and development of new ingredients having improved fragrance or flavor value the ingredients research program discovers molecules found in natural substances and creates new molecules that are subsequently tested for their fragrance or flavor value the new molecules that meet rigorous requirements for commercial development are subsequently transferred to manufacturing operations for production 

creative and technical product development is conducted in 33 fragrance and flavor laboratories in 26 countries we maintain a research and development center at union beach new jersey we spent 219 million in 2010 185 million in 2009 and 197 million in 2008 on our research and development activities or about 8 of our revenues each year we expect these expenditures to remain at this percentage level for 2011 of the amount expended in 2010 on such activities 54 was for fragrances and the balance was for flavors we employed 1117 persons in 2010 and 1091 persons in 2009 in such activities 

our business is not materially dependent upon any patents trademarks or licenses 

distribution 

distribution for our flavors and fragrances business units is similar in that most of our sales are through our own sales force the flavors business operates from two sales offices in the united states and 38 sales offices in 30 foreign countries while the fragrances business operates from two sales offices in the united states and 36 sales offices in 29 foreign countries sales in additional countries are made through agents and distributors for the year ended december 31 2010 34 of our sales were to customers in europe africa and middle east “eame” 26 in greater asia 25 in north america and 15 in latin america 

  4 

during 2010 our 25 largest customers accounted for 52 of our sales sales to our largest customer accounted for 10 of our sales in 2010 and 11 in 2009 and 2008 these sales were largely in the fragrance business unit 

governmental regulation 

the manufacture and sale of our products are subject to regulation in the united states by the food and drug administration the department of agriculture the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms the environmental protection agency the occupational safety and health administration the drug enforcement administration state authorities and us customs and border protection foreign subsidiaries are subject to similar regulation in a number of countries in particular the european union will require extensive chemical registration and testing over the next 7 years compliance with existing governmental requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment has not materially affected our operations earnings or competitive position in 2011 we expect to spend approximately 6 to 7 million on capital projects and approximately 18 million in operating expenses and governmental charges for the purpose of complying with such requirements 

raw material purchases 

we purchase roughly 10000 different raw materials from many sources all over the world the principal natural raw materials consist of essential oils extracts and concentrates which are derived from fruits vegetables flowers woods and other botanicals animal products and raw fruits the principal synthetic raw material purchases consist of organic chemicals we believe that alternate materials or alternate sources of materials are available to enable us to maintain our competitive position in the event of any interruption in the supply of raw materials from present sources 

competition 

we have more than 50 competitors in the world markets iff is one of the top four companies which together represent approximately 70 of the flavors and fragrances industry while no single factor is responsible our competitive position is based principally on the creative skills of our perfumers and flavorists the technological advances resulting from our research and development activities the quality of our customer service the support provided by our marketing and application groups and our understanding of consumers we believe that we are one of the largest companies producing and marketing on an international basis a wide range of fragrance and flavor products for sale to manufacturers of consumer products in particular countries and localities we face competition from numerous companies specializing in certain product lines among which are some companies larger than us and some more important in a particular product line or lines most of our customers do not buy all of their fragrance or flavor products from the same supplier and some customers make their own fragrance or flavor compounds with ingredients supplied by us or others 

employee relations 

at december 31 2010 we employed approximately 5500 persons of whom approximately 1400 were employed in the united states we have not experienced a work stoppage or strike and consider our employee relations to be satisfactory

 item 1a   risk factors tableend 

the following are some important factors that could cause the company’s actual results to differ materially from those referred to or implied in any forwardlooking statement these are in addition to the risks and uncertainties discussed elsewhere in this annual report of form 10k and in the company’s other filings with the securities and exchange commission 

the current volatility in global economic conditions and the financial markets may adversely affect our industry business and results of operations 

the volatility and disruption to the capital and credit markets since mid2008 has rapidly impacted global economic conditions resulting in significant recessionary pressures and declines in consumer confidence and economic growth these conditions led to economic contractions in the developed economies and reduced growth rates in the emerging markets recent conditions have begun to improve although potential volatility continues to exist despite fiscal and monetary intervention it is possible that further declines in or depressed levels of consumer spending and global growth rates may occur in the foreseeable future reduced consumer spending may cause changes in customer order patterns including order cancellations and changes in the level of inventory at our customers which may adversely affect our industry business and results of operations the impact of the credit crisis and economic slowdown will vary by region and country the diversity of our geographic customer and operating footprint limits our reliance and exposure to any single economy 

  7 

these conditions have also resulted in a substantial tightening of the credit markets including lending by financial institutions and in the commercial paper market both of which are sources of credit for our borrowing and liquidity this tightening of the credit markets has increased the cost of capital and reduced the availability of credit based on our latest discussions we believe that the financial institutions syndicated under our revolving credit facility are able to fulfill their commitments as of our filing date while conditions have improved recently it is difficult to predict how long the current economic and capital and credit market conditions will continue whether they will deteriorate and which aspects of our products or business could be adversely affected however if current levels of economic and capital and credit market disruption and volatility continue or worsen there can be no assurance that we will not experience an adverse impact which may be material on our business the cost of and access to capital and credit markets and our results of operations in addition we monitor the financial condition of our customers on a regular basis based on public information or data provided directly to us if the financial condition of one of our major customers was negatively impacted by market conditions liquidity or other adverse events we could be adversely impacted in terms of sales potential excess capacity accounts receivable andor inventory specifically attributable to them 

failure to maintain the integrity of our raw materials supply chain and finished goods may adversely impact sales and our results of operations iff’s reputation and litigation costs 

the manufacture and sale of our products are subject to various regulatory requirements in each of the countries in which our products are manufactured and sold in addition we are subject to product safety and compliance requirements established by the industry or similar oversight bodies we use a variety of strategies methodologies and tools to identify current products standards assess relative risks in our supply chain that can impact product integrity monitor internal and external performance and test raw materials and finished goods to minimize the likelihood of product or process noncompliance 

if a noncompliance event went undetected we could be subject to customer claims penalties litigation costs andor settlements remediation costs or loss of sales these consequences would be exacerbated if our customer did not identify the defect and there was a resulting impact at the consumer level this could lead to potentially large scale adverse publicity and potential consumer litigation 

competitive factors may negatively impact our sales and marketability 

the market for flavors and fragrances is fragmented and highly competitive iff competes with many companies and some of our competitors specialize in one or more of our product segments while others participate in many of the same segments in addition some of our competitors may have greater financial and technical resources the discovery and development of new flavor and fragrance materials protection of the company’s intellectual property and development and retention of key employees are important issues in our ability to compete in our businesses increased competition by existing or future competitors including aggressive price competition could result in the potential loss of substantial sales or create the need for us to reduce prices or increase spending and this could have an impact on sales and profitability 

we are subject to economic and social changes which may impact sales 

demand for consumer products using flavors and fragrances has been stimulated and broadened by changing social habits resulting from factors such as increases in personal income dualearner households teenage population leisure time health concerns and urbanization and by the continued growth in world population changes in any number of external economic factors or changes in social or consumer preferences could materially adversely impact our results of operations nearly 56 of our sales occur in the developed markets of north america western europe and australasia with the remainder in emerging markets accordingly the impact on our operations will depend upon consumer spending on products for which we supply the flavor or fragrance in these global markets 

results may be negatively impacted by the price quality and availability of raw materials 

raw materials are purchased from many sources from all over the world including essential oils extracts and concentrates derived from fruits vegetables flowers woods and other botanicals animal products raw fruits and organic chemicals disruptions in the supply or quality of ingredients or rising prices for ingredients purchased could adversely impact our results of operations and profitability historically we have experienced the greatest amount of volatility in natural products that represent approximately 50 of raw material purchases availability and pricing of these products such as citrus can be impacted by crop size and quality weather demand balance or alternative land use to mitigate our sourcing risk we maintain strategic stock levels covering multiple periods for critical items andor time purchases to capitalize on favorable market conditions 

  8 

results may be negatively impacted by the inability to implement our business strategy including the achievement of anticipated cost savings profitability or growth targets 

we are committed to those particular business strategies and market segments that have been identified as likely to drive profitable future growth and improve operations and customer service if we are unable to successfully and timely implement these strategies it would adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 

results may be negatively affected by the impact of currency fluctuation or devaluation in principal foreign markets and the effectiveness of hedging and risk management strategies 

our operations are conducted in many countries the results of which are reported in the local currency and then translated into us dollars at applicable exchange rates the exchange rates between these currencies and the us dollar have fluctuated and may continue to do so in the future we employ a variety of techniques to reduce the impact of exchange rate fluctuations including sourcing strategies and a limited number of foreign currency hedging activities however volatility in currency exchange rates may materially adversely impact our reported results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

results may be negatively impacted by the outcome of uncertainties related to litigation 

we are involved in a number of legal claims while we believe that related insurance coverage is adequate with respect to such claims we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of such litigation in addition we cannot provide assurance that future events will not result in an increase in the number of claims or require an increase in the amount accrued for any such claims or require accrual for one or more claims that has not been previously accrued 

results and cash flows may be negatively impacted by future pension funding and other postretirement obligations 

we establish assumptions concerning discount rates and actuarial assumptions regarding pension funding and other postretirement benefit obligations based on current market conditions plan participants asset returns interest rates and other factors changes in pension and other postretirement benefits plan assets and associated expenses may occur in the future due to changes in capital markets employee demographics and actuarial assumptions these changes may adversely impact our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

results may be negatively impacted by the effect of legal and regulatory requirements as well as restrictions imposed on operations by foreign and domestic governmental entities 

the manufacture and sale of our products are subject to regulation in the united states by the food and drug administration the department of agriculture the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms the environmental protection agency the occupational safety and health administration the drug enforcement administration and state authorities in addition we are subject to product safety and compliance requirements established by the industry or similar oversight bodies our foreign operations are subject to similar substantial governmental regulation and oversight standards in a number of countries including extensive requirements within the european union costs or investments necessary to maintain compliance with existing or future governmental regulations may adversely impact our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

we may face risks associated with events which may affect the world economy 

world events such as terrorist attacks or regional conflicts have and may in the future weaken world economies any resulting weaknesses in these economies may materially adversely affect our business or the businesses of our customers with a resultant negative impact on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

  9 

our success depends on attracting and retaining talented people within our business any shortfall in recruitment or retention could adversely affect our ability to compete and achieve our strategic goals 

attracting developing and retaining talented employees is essential to the successful delivery of our products and success in the marketplace the ability to attract and retain talented employees is critical in the development of new products that meet the needs of our customers however we cannot be certain that we will be able to attract and retain such employees in the future any shortfalls in recruitment or retention could adversely affect our ability to operate successfully retain our existing customers grow our business and effectively compete with our competitors 

our operations may be affected by greenhouse emissions and climate change and related regulations 

the availability of raw materials and energy supplies fluctuate in markets throughout the world climate change may also effect the availability and price of key raw materials including natural products used in the manufacture of our products in order to mitigate the risk of price increases and shortages purchasing has developed various sourcing strategies including multiple suppliers inventory management systems various geographic suppliers and long term agreements to mitigate risk 

in addition to market forces there are various regulatory efforts relating to climate change that may increase the cost of raw materials especially energy used to operate our facilities that could materially impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

changes in our tax rates the adoption of new us or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our future results 

we are subject to taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in reserves and contingencies cost of repatriations or changes in tax laws or their interpretation in addition the current administration and congress have announced proposals for new us tax legislation that if adopted could adversely affect our tax rate any of these changes could have a material adverse affect on our profitability we are also subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations will not materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results

patent claims 

a complaint captioned v mane fils sa v international flavors and fragrances inc was filed in us district court for the district of new jersey in may 2006 and alleges that the company has and continues to infringe us patent nos 5725856 and 5843466 relating to a flavor ingredient that may provide a cooling effect the company answered the complaint by denying liability and asserting that both patents are invalid and various other defenses in june 2008 plaintiff amended its complaint to add claims for violations of the lanham act tortious interference and unfair competition the company answered the amended complaint by denying all liability in connection with the patent claims the plaintiff seeks monetary damages damages for alleged willful infringement injunctive relief and fees costs and interest in connection with the additional claims plaintiff also seeks monetary damages punitive damages fees and costs in may 2010 following reexamination of the patents in question by the us patent office all of the patent claims initially rejected in the reexamination proceeding were reallowed the company and the plaintiff have each filed motions for summary judgment with respect to various claims no trial date has been scheduled the company denies the allegations and will defend its position in court we analyze our liability on a regular basis and accrue for litigation loss contingencies when they are probable and estimable during the second quarter 2010 we recorded a provision related to this case which is reflected in other liabilities based on present information the company believes that its ultimate liability if any arising from this proceeding would not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or liquidity however due to the unpredictability regarding the litigation process such claim if ultimately resolved against us could potentially have a material adverse effect on our cash flows or financial results in a particular period an adverse outcome could also potentially affect our ability to sell one or more flavor products to the extent the court ultimately issued an injunction related to the patents the company disputes the allegations of wrongdoing believes it has meritorious defenses and is vigorously defending all claims

environmental 

over the past 20 years various federal and state authorities and private parties have claimed that the company is a potentially responsible party “prp” as a generator of waste materials for alleged pollution at a number of waste sites operated by third parties located principally in new jersey and have sought to recover costs incurred and to be incurred to clean up the sites 

the company has been identified as a prp at ten facilities operated by third parties at which investigation andor remediation activities may be ongoing the company analyzes its liability on a regular basis the company accrues for environmental liabilities when they are probable and estimable the company estimates its share of the total future cost for these sites to be less than 5 million 

while joint and several liability is authorized under federal and state environmental laws the company believes the amounts it has paid and anticipates paying in the future for cleanup costs and damages at all sites are not and will not be material to the company’s financial condition results of operations or liquidity this conclusion is based upon among other things the involvement of other prps at most sites the status of proceedings including various settlement agreements and consent decrees the extended time period over which payments will likely be made and an agreement reached in july 1994 with three of the company’s liability insurers pursuant to which defense costs and indemnity amounts payable by the company in respect of the sites will be shared by the insurers up to an agreed amount

executive overview 

we are a leading creator and manufacturer of flavor and fragrance compounds used to impart or improve the flavor or fragrance in a wide variety of consumer products the precise size of the global market for flavors and fragrances is difficult to determine because the industry is highly fragmented both geographically and along product lines there are a limited number of publicly traded companies in the industry certain customers maintain inhouse capabilities fulfilling a portion of their flavor or fragrance needs and the quality and depth of market information in developing regions of the world is limited analysts generally estimate the global market to be 1516 billion of which iff represents 1617 the largest competitor in the industry has approximately a 25 market share iff is one of the top four companies which together represent approximately 70 of the flavors and fragrances industry 

iff is organized into two units that reflect our flavor and fragrance businesses approximately 46 of our 2010 net sales were flavor compounds flavor compounds are sold to the food and beverage industries for use in consumer products such as prepared foods beverages dairy food and confectionery products the remaining 54 of sales representing the fragrance business unit were in three fragrance categories functional fragrances including fragrance compounds for personal care eg soaps and household products eg detergents and cleaning agents fine fragrance and beauty care including perfumes colognes and toiletries and ingredients consisting of natural and synthetic ingredients that can be combined with other materials to create unique functional and fine fragrance compounds major fragrance customers include the cosmetics industry including perfume and toiletries manufacturers and the household products industry including manufacturers of soaps detergents fabric care household cleaners and air fresheners approximately 55 of our ingredient production is consumed internally the balance is sold to third party customers

consolidated operating results 

the percentage relationship of cost of goods sold and other operating expenses to reported sales is detailed as follows 

 

cost of goods sold includes the cost of materials and manufacturing expenses raw materials generally constitute 70 of the total research and development expenses are for the development of new and improved products technical product support compliance with governmental regulations and help in maintaining relationships with customers who are often dependent on technological advances selling and administrative expenses support our sales and operating levels 

2010 in comparison to 2009 

cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales decreased to 583 in 2010 compared to 598 during 2009 the improvement in 2010 versus the prior year period reflects favorable input costs combined with better absorption resulting from higher volumes continued margin recovery efforts and a stronger sales mix this improvement was partially offset by inventory writeoffs and transition costs associated with the rationalization of our fragrance and ingredients’ operations in europe 

research and development rd expenses increased approximately 34 million from the prior year the increase was due to growth driven incentive compensation accruals of 15 million and lower rd tax credits of 5 million the remaining increase was due to higher basic research targeted investments to support strategic growth initiatives and lower prior period base comparison resulting from some curtailment in 2009 spend due to the then prevailing economic crisis 

selling and administrative expenses sa as a percentage of sales increased slightly to 171 of sales compared to 168 for 2009 overall spending increased 57 million versus the prior year mainly driven by higher provisions for incentive compensation of 36 million the remaining variance was due to planned investments and volume related activity to support growth contingency related costs and fees and lower prior period base spending in 2009 due to the prevailing economic crisis the 2009 results include approximately 6 million of severance and related costs primarily associated with the change in ceo 

interest expense 

during 2010 interest expense totaled 49 million compared to 62 million in 2009 the 2009 amount includes 4 million of interest paid on the closeout of a crosscurrency interest rate swap classified as a net investment hedge the additional reduction versus 2009 reflects certain debt repayments of more than 210 million made during the second half of 2009 average cost of debt was 50 for the 2010 period compared to 55 in 2009 

other expense income net 

other expense was 8 million in 2010 versus other income of 2 million in 2009 approximately 50 of which relates to losses on foreign exchange transactions the remaining change is principally attributable to higher provisions for noncontrolling interest in consolidated subsidiaries and miscellaneous nonoperating expenses 

income taxes 

the effective tax rate for the year 2010 was 267 compared to 293 during 2009 the yearoveryear decrease reflects the mix of earnings across the countries in which the company operates an adjustment to provisions for tax reserves and lower repatriation costs the 2009 results include 6 million of tax expense due to the recognition of outofperiod tax adjustments arising from periods 2006 and prior and was also impacted by the higher level of restructuring costs which carried lower tax benefits

we evaluate the performance of business units based on operating profit before interest expense other expense income net and income taxes see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for the reconciliation to income before taxes 

flavors business unit 

in 2010 flavors operating profit totaled 243 million or 202 as a percentage of sales compared to 208 million or 193 in 2009 the improvement in profitability was mainly driven by a 100 basis point bps improvement in gross margin resulting from strong sales growth and better absorption improving input costs and the benefits of our margin improvement initiatives partially offset by higher tolling costs associated with some outsourcing of work research selling and administrative costs rsa were down 10 bps as a percentage of sales higher overall rsa expenses were due to targeted investments in business development growth driven incentive compensation costs and product liability and other contingency claims 

fragrances business unit 

fragrances operating profit for 2010 was 235 million or 165 as a percentage of sales compared to 171 million or 137 reported in 2009 the 2010 period includes 10 million of restructuring related charges related to the rationalization of our european fragrance manufacturing footprint compared to 18 million in the prior year period excluding restructuring charges in each period operating profit increased more than 56 million to 245 million 173 of sales versus 189 million 151 of sales during 2009 the improvement in profit was driven by a 200 bps increase in gross margin resulting from higher volumes and net win performance favorable input costs and the benefits of ongoing profit improvement initiatives which were partially offset by inventory writeoffs and transition costs associated with the rationalization of our fragrances and ingredients’ operations in europe rsa as a percentage of sales improved 150 bps due to positive cost leverage on our higher volume higher overall rsa expenses were due to increased incentive compensation expense lower rd credits and investments in business development 

global expenses 

global expenses represent corporate and headquartersrelated expenses which include legal finance human resources and other administrative expenses that are not allocated to an individual business unit in 2010 global expenses were 61 million compared to 39 million during 2009 the increase in global expenses is mainly due to higher incentive compensation of 22 million with the balance mainly related to litigation related provisions and costs in 2009 global expenses included 6 million of employee separation costs associated with the change in ceo 

2009 in comparison to 2008 

cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales was 598 in 2009 compared with 594 in 2008 this increase reflects higher input costs a weaker sales mix principally related to fine fragrance and slightly lower absorption that could only be partially offset by cost recovery and productivity and margin improvement efforts including pricing 

rd expenses were down 121 million in 2009 compared to the prior year mainly due to increased foreign rd credits of 8 million driven by program enhancements and additional qualifying expenditures the remaining reduction was due to tight cost control on applied research and development and the effects of a stronger us dollar partially offset by higher incentive compensation during 2008 and the first nine months of 2009 these credits were previously recognized as a reduction of tax expense 

sa as a percentage of sales was 168 during 2009 and 2008 the 2009 results include 60 million of employee separation costs and expenses related to the change in ceo whereas the 2008 amount included the benefit of a 26 million insurance recovery related to a prior period product liability claim offset by 34 million for employee separation costs excluding these items sa declined 15 million and would have been 165 as a percentage of sales in 2009 compared to 167 in 2008 the reduction in sa dollars reflects a stronger us currency and cost reduction efforts which more than offset higher pension expense higher incentive compensation expense and provision for product claims 

  26 

interest expense 

during 2009 interest expense totaled 618 million as compared to 740 million in 2008 the 2009 decrease reflects a lower average borrowing cost the elimination of a crosscurrency interest rate swap during the second half of 2008 and debt repayments during 2009 the 2009 amount includes 4 million of interest paid on the closeout of a crosscurrency interest rate swap classified as a net investment hedge average cost of debt was 55 for 2009 compared to 61 in 2008 

other expense income net 

other expense during 2009 was 19 million compared to other income of 28 million in 2008 approximately 50 of the change was mainly due to yearoveryear changes in foreign exchange gainslosses on trade receivables and payables during the year during 2008 the company recognized foreign exchange gains primarily during the fourth quarter as a result of the rapid strengthening of the us dollar usd during the period of financial turmoil during 2009 we saw a general weakening trend for the usd that has resulted in a higher level of foreign exchange losses on trade receivables and payables the remaining change was due to less favorable marktomarket adjustments on our investments 

income taxes 

the effective tax rate for the year 2009 was 293 compared to 191 during 2008 the 2008 period included a 23 million reduction in tax expense related primarily to prior period tax settlements versus 2 million during 2009 the 2009 results include 6 million of tax expense due to the recognition of outofperiod tax adjustments arising from periods 2006 and prior the company did not adjust the prior periods as it concluded that such adjustments were not material to the prior periods’ consolidated financial statements or to the current year excluding these items from both periods as well as the previously discussed restructuring charges the tax rate for 2009 was 274 compared to 275 for 2008 the change reflects 3 million of higher repatriation costs on foreign earnings offset by a net reduction of valuation allowances on certain deferred assets and the mix of earnings between high and low tax jurisdictions 

operating results by business unit 

we evaluate the performance of business units based on operating profit before interest expense other expense income net and income taxes see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for the reconciliation to income before taxes 

flavors business unit 

in 2009 flavors operating profit totaled 208 million or 193 of sales compared to 198 million or 181 of sales in 2008 the operating profit improvement reflects increased prices ongoing cost discipline and cost recovery and margin improvement efforts which more than offset higher input costs and negative currency impacts the 2008 amount included 35 million of restructuring expenses versus 06 million in 2009 

fragrances business unit 

in 2009 fragrances operating profit was 171 million or 137 of sales compared to 202 million or 156 of sales in 2008 the 2008 figure has been revised to reflect rd credits that were previously reflected as a reduction of tax expense the 2009 amount includes 18 million of restructuring related expenses compared to 4 million in 2008 during 2009 as part of the rationalization of our european fragrance manufacturing footprint we decided to close our fragrance compounding facility in ireland and partially close our ingredients plant in the united kingdom uk in addition we eliminated 60 positions to improve profitability 

the decline in profit was driven by significantly lower volumes in fine fragrances and ingredients higher input costs and unfavorable mix partially offset by improved pricing margin recovery efforts lower overhead expenses and 8 million of additional rd credits versus the prior year excluding the restructuring charges operating profit margins declined 70 bps over the comparable prior year period 

  27 

global expenses 

global expenses represent corporate and headquartersrelated expenses which include legal finance human resources and other administrative expenses that are not allocated to an individual business unit in 2009 global expenses were 39 million compared to 45 million during 2008 in 2009 global expenses included 6 million of employee separation costs associated with the change in ceo global expenses in 2008 included approximately 10 million of restructuring charges and 3 million of employee separation costs and 2 million of implementation costs related to our global shared service structure partially offset by a 3 million insurance recovery related to prior period product liability claim excluding these items global expenses were flat indicative of strict cost control measures that offset inflationary pressure 

goodwill and intangible assets 

at december 31 2010 and 2009 goodwill and other intangible assets net of accumulated amortization totaled 714 million and 721 million respectively additional details are contained in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements 

other intangible assets include patents trademarks and other intellectual property valued at acquisition primarily through independent appraisals which are amortized on a straightline basis over periods ranging from 6 to 20 years we review our other intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in business conditions indicate that their full carrying value may not be recovered 

restructuring and other charges 

restructuring and other charges primarily consist of separation costs for employees including severance outplacement and other benefit costs 

the company recorded a net pretax charge of 41 million during the second quarter ended june 30 2009 this amount included 66 million for severance and related costs associated with the elimination of approximately 70 positions globally less a 25 million reduction to previously recorded provisions the reduction in prior reserves was attributable to lower estimated benefit costs on severance paid as well as fewer position eliminations requiring severance 

during september 2009 as part of the rationalization of our european fragrance manufacturing footprint the company announced that it had initiated a collective consultation process with employees regarding the closure of its fragrances compounding facility in drogheda ireland as well as the partial closure of its fragrance ingredients plant in haverhill uk the company has completed both consultation processes and has communicated its intent to proceed with the closures the company completed the negotiations with the haverhill employee representatives during the fourth quarter of 2009 

the company has completed its negotiations with the drogheda ireland employee representatives regarding separation benefits related to the closure of the company’s compounding facility at that location during the third quarter 2010 based upon the periodend estimates regarding the separation agreements the company increased its provision for severance costs by approximately 4 million in 2010 the balance of the restructuring charges in 2010 was mainly due to accelerated depreciation and other restructuring related costs pertaining to the rationalization of our fragrances and ingredients operations in europe the company ceased its operations at the drogheda plant as of september 30 2010 the company is currently working with the trustees of the pension plan regarding various aspects associated with the funding requirements for the plan which it expects to conclude in the first quarter of 2011 

we expect to incur total costs related to this restructuring plan of approximately 34 million consisting primarily of 18 million of employee termination costs 12 million in plant shutdown and business transition costs and 4 million in accelerated depreciation of related fixed assets the increase from our prior estimate reflects projected higher inventory writeoffs and transition costs associated with a more complex operating environment due to higher activity levels and potential incremental pension settlement costs 

  28 

inception to date we have recorded total expenses of 308 million relating to this plan of which 245 million was recorded to restructuring and other charges and 63 million recorded to costs of sales and research selling and administrative expenses 

positions eliminated and charges net of reversal by business segment in 2010 2009 and 2008 are detailed in the table below 

 

movements in related accruals during 2008 2009 and 2010 are as follows 

 

the remaining employeerelated liabilities are expected to be utilized by 2011 as obligations are satisfied 

income taxes 

effective utilization of the cash generated by our international operations is a critical component of our tax strategy strategic dividend repatriation from foreign subsidiaries creates us taxable income which enables us to recognize deferred tax assets 

pursuant to asc 740 “income taxes” we establish a valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets if based on the weight of the available evidence it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized historically we have provided a full valuation allowance against deferred tax assets resulting from state net operating losses and state credits as well as selective nonus affiliates’ net operating losses the changes in the valuation allowances from december 31 2009 are primarily attributable to the increase in amortizable intangibles in nonus affiliates

financial condition 

cash and cash equivalents totaled 131 million at december 31 2010 compared to 80 million at december 31 2009 working capital totaled 664 million at yearend 2010 compared to 644 million at december 31 2009 the 2010 increase in working capital reflects sharply higher commercial activity the buildup of contingency stocks related to the european rationalization plan and higher inventory levels needed to meet customer requirements accounts receivable was up slightly due to higher commercial activity which was partially offset by reductions in past due balances the increase in our current liabilities was driven by higher trade payables mainly due to the higher commercial activity and a more disciplined approach in our “purchase to pay” process and increased accruals for income taxes and incentive compensation gross additions to property plant and equipment were 106 million 67 million and 85 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively and are expected to approximate 45 of sales in 2011 the increase in capital expenditures is mainly attributable to investments needed to support growth in emerging markets and certain capacity expansions in critical process technologies 

our financial condition continues to be strong as evidenced by substantial cash flow from operations and substantial drawdown capacity of approximately 818 million on our multiyear revolving credit facility operating cash flow provides the primary source of funds for operating and capital needs as well as dividends paid to shareholders we anticipate that cash flows from operations and availability under our existing credit facilities are sufficient to fund our capital spending and other cash requirements for at least the next eighteen months we regularly assess our capital structure including both current and longterm debt instruments as compared to our cash generation and investment needs in order to provide ample flexibility 

as discussed in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements at december 31 2010 we had entered into various guarantees and had undrawn outstanding letters of credit from financial institutions these arrangements were entered into in connection with normal business operations and based on the current facts and circumstances they are not reasonably likely to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

operating cash flow in 2010 was 315 million compared to 292 million and 221 million in 2009 and 2008 respectively the improvement in operating cash flows during 2010 as compared to 2009 reflects higher earnings in the current year period partially offset by the higher core working capital receivables plus inventory minus payables discussed above we began to see the benefits of our internal process improvement initiatives for our core working capital efficiency in the second half of 2009 we expect to make additional operational gains in working capital management going forward the improvement in operating cash flows during 2009 as compared to 2008 was led by the reduction of our inventories which was driven by our internal process improvement initiatives combined with better operating discipline over receivables and payables operating cash flows in 2008 benefited from the receipt of 18 million on termination of an interest rate swap the decrease in other assets and liabilities was driven by longterm incentive plan payments lower deferred taxes and pension and other postretirement payments 

net investing activities in 2010 utilized 107 million compared to 81 million and 90 million in 2009 and 2008 respectively the increase in investing activities in 2010 resulted from capital investments to support capacity requirements in emerging markets as well as key technologies primarily in the flavors business the reduction in 2009 funds used compared to 2008 reflects a 20 million decline in capital spending partially offset by a 14 million payment to terminate a net investment hedge related to our investment in europe 

compliance with existing governmental requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment has not materially affected our operations earnings or competitive position in 2010 and 2009 we spent 6 million and 4 million respectively on capital projects and 18 million and 17 million respectively in operating expenses and governmental charges for the purpose of complying with such regulations expenditures for these purposes will continue for the foreseeable future in addition we are party to a number of proceedings brought under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act or similar state statutes it is expected that the impact of any judgments in or voluntary settlements of such proceedings will not be material to our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

  30

no shares were repurchased during the year ended december 31 2010 during the year ended december 31 2009 we repurchased 75000 shares on the open market at a cost of 2 million or an average of 2622 per share for the year ended december 31 2008 we repurchased 700000 shares of our common stock at a cost of 30 million on the open market 

in july 2007 our board authorized us to repurchase up to 15 or 750 million worth of our then outstanding common stock whichever is less in september 2007 under the july 2007 plan we entered into two agreements to purchase shares of our common stock under a 450 million accelerated share repurchase “asr” program the asr concluded in june 2008 total aggregate shares repurchased under the asr program were 97 million shares at an average purchase price of 4653 the asr was primarily funded through the issuance of 500 million of senior unsecured notes in four series under a note purchase agreement see note 8 borrowings to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding these notes 

we supplement shortterm liquidity with access to capital markets mainly through bank credit facilities and issuance of commercial paper in 2005 iff including certain subsidiaries entered into a revolving credit agreement the “facility” with certain banks the facility provides for a us 350 million “tranche a” and euro 400 million “tranche b” multicurrency revolving credit facility tranche a is available to iff for commercial paper backstop and general corporate purposes tranche b is available to both iff and the european subsidiaries for general corporate purposes borrowings under the facility bear interest at an annual rate of libor or in relation to any eurodenominated loans euribor plus a margin currently 25 bps linked to our credit rating we pay a commitment fee on the aggregate unused commitments such fee is not material the facility expires on november 23 2012 during 2008 the maximum amount of outstanding commercial paper was 30 million we did not issue commercial paper during 2010 and 2009 

as of december 31 2010 we had total borrowings under the facility of 61 million the amount which we are able to draw down on under the facility is limited by financial covenants as described in more detail below at december 31 2010 we had a remaining overall borrowing capacity of 840 million however our drawdown capacity on the facility was limited to 818 million based on existing balances outstanding under the facility at december 31 2010 

at december 31 2010 we had 922 million of debt outstanding compared to 1012 million outstanding at december 31 2009 we regularly assess our capital structure including both current and longterm debt instruments as compared to our cash generation and investment needs in order to provide ample flexibility in that connection in december 2009 we prepaid without penalty the remaining outstanding balance approximately 151 million of our japanese yen loan which was scheduled to mature in 2011 total debt repayments during 2010 amounted to 103 million as compared to 238 million in 2009 in 2011 we have principal debt repayments related to our 2006 series b note of 100 million and japanese yen note of 22 million 

in february 2009 we terminated a 300 million usd libor to euribor interest rate swap which required us to make a payment of 16 million see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding these transactions 

the facility contains the most restrictive covenant requiring us to maintain at the end of each fiscal quarter a ratio of net debt for borrowed money to adjusted ebitda in respect of the previous 12month period of not more than 325 to 1 

  31 

at december 31 2010 and 2009 we were in compliance with all financial and other covenants at december 31 2010 our net debtadjusted ebitda 1 was 156 to 1 as defined by the debt agreements well below the financial covenants of existing outstanding debt failure to comply with the financial and other covenants under these agreements would constitute default and would allow the lenders to accelerate the maturity of all indebtedness under the related agreement if such acceleration were to occur we would not have sufficient liquidity available to repay the indebtedness we would likely have to seek amendments under the agreements for relief from the financial covenants or repay the debt with proceeds from the issuance of new debt or equity andor asset sales if necessary we may be unable to amend the agreements or raise sufficient capital to repay such obligations in the event the maturities are accelerated 

  

  

  32 

at december 31 2010 we had contractual payment obligations due within the time periods as specified in the following table 

 

 the table above does not include 64 million of the total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions and approximately 11 million of associated accrued interest due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential cash flows the company is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid 

critical accounting policies and use of estimates 

our accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements as disclosed in note 1 the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and accompanying disclosures these estimates are based on management’s best judgment of current events and actions that we may undertake in the future actual results may ultimately differ from estimates 

those areas requiring the greatest degree of management judgment or deemed most critical to our financial reporting involve 

the periodic assessment of potential impairment of intangible assets acquired in business combinations  we currently have net intangible assets including goodwill of 714 million goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually in assessing the potential for impairment of goodwill management uses the most current actual and forecasted operating data available and current market based assumptions in accordance with the criteria in asc 350 “intangibles — goodwill and other” we identified two reporting units the flavors reporting unit and the fragrances reporting unit these reporting units were determined based on the level at which the performance is measured and reviewed we perform a goodwill impairment test on an annual basis or more frequently in certain circumstances we utilize the twostep approach by assessing the fair value of our reporting units based on discounted cash flows in addition we utilize external market data of comparable companies to assess the reasonableness of the cash flows’ indicated values there have been no significant changes to the methodologies used for valuing goodwill since the prior year we deem goodwill to be impaired if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value we completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of november 30 2010 which indicated no impairment of goodwill as the estimated fair values substantially exceeded the carrying values of each of our reporting units in addition there were no triggering events which required asset impairment reviews and the undiscounted cash flows associated with other longlived intangible assets

the analysis and evaluation of income taxes we account for taxes in accordance with asc 740 “income taxes” under asc 740 deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities based on tax laws as currently enacted the provision for income taxes is based on statutory income tax rates and planning opportunities available in the various tax jurisdictions where we operate significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and tax positions we may be challenged upon review by the applicable taxing authority and positions taken by us may not be sustained we regularly update these accruals in light of changing facts and circumstances 

the evaluation of potential legal and environmental liabilities where changing circumstances rules and regulations require regular reassessment of related practices and anticipated costs we are subject to certain legal claims regarding products and other matters as well as environmentalrelated matters significant management judgment is involved in determining when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the extent to which it can be reasonably estimated 

we regularly assess potential liabilities with respect to all legal claims based on the most recent available information in consultation with outside counsel handling the defense of such matters to the extent a liability is deemed to have been incurred and can be reasonably estimated we recognize a corresponding liability if the reasonably estimated liability is a range we recognize that amount considered most likely or in the absence of such a determination the minimum reasonably estimated liability to the extent such claims are covered by various insurance policies we separately evaluate the likelihood of recovery and account for any related insurance receivable management judgments involve determination as to whether a liability has been incurred the reasonably estimated amount of that liability and any potential insurance recovery 

we regularly evaluate potential environmental exposure in terms of total estimated cost and the viability of other potentially responsible parties “prp’s” associated with our exposure recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress and additional information becomes available critical management assumptions relate to expected total costs to remediate and the financial viability of prp’s to share such costs 

determination of the various assumptions employed in the valuation of pension and retiree health care expense and associated obligations amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined from actuarial valuations inherent in such valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets discount rates at which the liabilities could be settled rates of increase in future compensation levels mortality rates and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore affect expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods 

we consider a number of factors in determining and selecting assumptions for the overall expected longterm rate of return on plan assets we consider the historical longterm return experience of our assets the current and expected allocation of our plan assets and expected longterm rates of return we derive these expected longterm rates of return with the assistance of our investment advisors we base our expected allocation of plan assets on a diversified portfolio consisting of domestic and international equity securities fixed income real estate and alternative asset classes 

  34 

we consider a variety of factors in determining and selecting our assumptions for the discount rate at december 31 for the us plans the discount rate was based on the internal rate of return for a portfolio of moody’s aaa aa and merrill lynch aaaaa high quality bonds with maturities that are consistent with the projected future benefit payment obligations of the plan the rate of compensation increase for all plans and the medical cost trend rate for the applicable us plans are based on plan experience 

with respect to the us plans the expected return on plan assets was determined based on an asset allocation model using the current target allocation real rates of return by asset class and an anticipated inflation rate the target asset allocation consists of approximately 6065 in equity securities and 3540 in fixed income securities the inflation rate assumed in the model was 25 the plan has achieved a compounded annual rate of return of approximately 8 over the previous 20 years at december 31 2010 the actual asset allocation was 64 in equity securities 35 in fixed income securities and 1 in cash 

the expected annual rate of return for the nonus plans employs a similar set of criteria adapted for local investments inflation rates and in certain cases specific government requirements the target asset allocation for the nonus plans consists of approximately 5560 in fixed income securities 30 35 in equity securities 510 in real estate and up to 5 in cash at december 31 2010 the actual asset allocation was 55 in fixed income investments 30 in equity investments 11 in real estate investments and 4 in cash 

management establishes the assumptions concerning discount rates and actuarial assumptions based on current market conditions including asset returns and other factors applicable under the circumstances changes in pension and other postemployment benefits and associated expenses may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions the impact that a 25 decrease in the discount rate or a 1 change in the medical cost trend rate would have on our pension and other postemployment benefit expense as applicable is discussed in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements 

the ongoing assessment of the valuation of inventory given the large number of natural ingredients employed the quality of which may be diminished over time we maintain approximately 50 of our inventory as raw materials providing the greatest degree of flexibility in manufacture and use materials are evaluated based on shelf life known uses and anticipated demand based on forecasted customer order activity and changes in productsales mix management policy provides for an ongoing assessment of inventory with adjustments recorded when an item is deemed to be slow moving or obsolete 

determination of various assumptions employed in the calculation of equity compensation expense amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to equity compensation are determined based on the number of awards and type of award as well as specific assumptions regarding expected life stock price volatility risk free interest rate termination rates exercise multiple and the dividend yield these assumptions are employed in the binomial model used to value certain awards management establishes the assumptions based on current market conditions and historical trends related to the equity awards 

developing the assumptions used in the binomial model requires significant judgment on our part and generally may involve analyzing available historical data considering whether historical data is relevant to predicting future behavior making appropriate adjustments to historical data for future expectations supplementing or replacing companyspecific historical data with data from other supportable sources and appropriately weighting each of the inputs these assumptions are evaluated at each grant date if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating sharebased compensation expense in future periods or if we decide to use a different valuation model the future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect operating income net income and net income per share 

  35 

we believe that we have considered relevant circumstances that we may be currently subject to and the financial statements accurately reflect our best estimate of the results of our operations financial condition and cash flows for the years presented we have discussed the decision process and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 

new accounting standards 

in january 2010 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued authoritative guidance revising certain disclosure requirements concerning fair value measurements the guidance requires an entity to disclose separately significant transfers into and out of levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy and to disclose the reasons for such transfers it will also require the presentation of purchases sales issuances and settlements within level 3 on a gross basis rather than a net basis these new disclosure requirements were effective for our first quarter of 2010 except for the additional disclosure of level 3 activity which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2010 we did not have any such transfers into and out of levels 1 and 2 during the year ended december 31 2010 

nongaap financial measures 

the company uses nongaap financial operating measures which exclude employee separation costs including costs associated with the change in the chief executive officer position in 2009 and restructuring charges including costs associated with the company’s ongoing restructuring efforts in europe in 2009 and 2010 benefits of favorable tax rulings and settlements relating to prior years the benefit of an insurance recovery and costs for the implementation of the global shared services structure in 2008 in addition in certain instances we exclude the effects of exchange rate fluctuations when discussing our historical performance the company also discloses from time to time nongaap effective tax rates which exclude the effect of the benefits of tax rulings relating to prior periods as additional information in seeking to assess and compare our tax rates without the benefit of those tax rulings such information is supplemental to information presented in accordance with gaap and is not intended to represent a presentation in accordance with gaap in discussing our historical and expected future results and financial condition we believe it is meaningful for investors to be made aware of and to be assisted in a better understanding of on a periodtoperiod comparative basis of financial amounts both including and excluding these identified items as well as the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on operating results and financial condition we believe such additional nongaap information provides investors with an overall perspective of the periodtoperiod performance of our core business in addition management internally reviews each of these nongaap measures to evaluate performance on a comparative periodtoperiod basis in terms of absolute performance trends and expected future performance with respect to our core continuing business a material limitation of these nongaap measures is that such measures do not reflect actual gaap amounts restructuring charges employee separation costs and implementation costs include actual cash outlays an insurance recovery is an actual cash recovery and benefits from favorable tax rulings and settlements reflect actual accounting and cash benefits realized and we compensate for such limitations by presenting the accompanying reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measure these nongaap measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend 

we operate on a global basis and are exposed to currency fluctuation related to the manufacture and sale of our products in currencies other than the us dollar the major foreign currencies involve the markets in the european union great britain mexico brazil china india indonesia australia and japan although all regions are subject to foreign currency fluctuations versus the us dollar we actively monitor our foreign currency exposures in all major markets in which we operate and employ a variety of techniques to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations including foreign currency hedging activities 

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts with the objective of reducing exposure to cash flow volatility associated with foreign currency receivables and payables and with anticipated purchases of certain raw materials used in operations these contracts the counterparties to which are major international financial institutions generally involve the exchange of one currency for a second currency at a future date and have maturities not exceeding twelve months the notional amount and maturity dates of such contracts match those of the underlying transactions the gain or loss on the hedging instrument and services is recorded in earnings at the same time as the transaction being hedged is recorded in earnings 

we have also used nonus dollar borrowings and foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the foreign currency exposures of our net investment in certain foreign affiliates primarily in the european union 

we use derivative instruments as part of our interest rate risk management strategy the derivative instruments used are comprised principally of fixed to floating rate interest rate swaps 

we have established a centralized reporting system to evaluate the effects of changes in interest rates currency exchange rates and other relevant market risks our risk management procedures include the monitoring of interest rate and foreign exchange exposures and hedge positions utilizing statistical analyses of cash flows market value and sensitivity analysis however the use of these techniques to quantify the market risk of such instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of their accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions market exposures are evaluated using a sensitivity model that is intended to measure the potential 10 loss in interest rate and foreign currency forward contracts assuming adverse market conditions occur historical interest rates and foreign exchange rates are used to estimate the volatility and correlation of future rates 

the estimated maximum potential oneday loss in fair value of interest rate or foreign currency forward contracts calculated using the sensitivity model is not material to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows in 2010 the estimated maximum yearly loss in earnings due to interest rate or foreign exchange rate instruments calculated utilizing the sensitivity model is not material to our results of operations in 2010 actual results in the future may differ materially from these projected results due to actual developments in the global financial markets

see note 12 segment information of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information concerning the two business segments flavors and fragrances and our geographic regions 

products 

our principal fragrance and flavor products consist of compounds of large numbers of ingredients blended in proprietary formulas created by our perfumers and flavorists most of these compounds contribute the total fragrance or flavor to the consumer products in which they are used this fragrance or flavor characteristic is often a major factor in the consumer selection and acceptance of the consumer end product a smaller number of compounds are sold to manufacturers who further blend them to achieve the finished fragrance or flavor in their products we produce thousands of compounds and new compounds are constantly being created in order to meet the many and changing characteristics of our customers’ end products most of the fragrance and flavor compounds are created and produced for the exclusive use of particular customers our products are sold in powder and liquid forms and in amounts ranging from a few pounds to many tons depending upon the nature of the product 

the ingredients that we use in our compounds are both synthetic and natural we manufacture a substantial portion of the synthetic ingredients while a majority of our synthetic ingredients production is used in our 

  

compounds a substantial portion is also sold to others natural ingredients are derived from flowers fruits and other botanical products as well as from animal products they contain varying numbers of organic chemicals which are responsible for the fragrance or flavor of the natural product the natural products are purchased in processed or semiprocessed form some are used in compounds in the state in which they are purchased and others after further processing natural products together with various chemicals are also used as raw materials for the manufacture of synthetic ingredients by chemical processes our flavor products also include extracts and seasonings derived from various fruits vegetables nuts herbs and spices as well as microbiologicallyderived ingredients 

market developments 

the demand for consumer products utilizing flavors and fragrances has been stimulated and broadened by changing social habits resulting from various factors such as increases in personal income dualearner households teenage population leisure time urbanization health and wellness concerns including increased demand for nature based products and by the continued growth of emerging markets in the fragrance field these developments expanded the market for hair care candles and air care products and deodorant and personal wash products with finer fragrance quality as well as the market for colognes toilet waters men’s toiletries and other products beyond traditional luxury items such as perfumes in the flavor field similar market characteristics stimulated the demand for products such as convenience foods soft drinks and lowfat and organic food products that must conform to expected tastes new and improved methods of packaging applying and dispensing have been developed for many consumer products that utilize some of our flavor or fragrance products these developments called for the creation of new compounds and ingredients compatible with the newly introduced materials and methods of application 

product development and research 

the development of new flavors and fragrances is a complex technical and artistic process calling upon the combined knowledge and skill of our creative perfumers and flavorists and our scientists with extensive experience the perfumers and flavorists continuously advance their skills for creating fragrances or flavors best suited to the market requirements of the customers’ products 

scientists from various disciplines work in project teams with the perfumers and flavorists to develop flavor and fragrance products with consumer preferred performance characteristics scientific expertise includes natural products research plant science organic chemistry analytical chemistry biochemistry microbiology process engineering food science material science and sensory science analytical and sensory science is applied to understand the complex interactions of the many ingredients in a consumer product in order to optimize the flavor or fragrance performance at all points of use material science technology is applied to create controlled release and delivery systems to enhance flavor and fragrance performance in consumer products an important contribution to the creation of new flavor and fragrances is the discovery and development of new ingredients having improved fragrance or flavor value the ingredients research program discovers molecules found in natural substances and creates new molecules that are subsequently tested for their fragrance or flavor value the new molecules that meet rigorous requirements for commercial development are subsequently transferred to manufacturing operations for production 

creative and technical product development is conducted in 33 fragrance and flavor laboratories in 26 countries we maintain a research and development center at union beach new jersey we spent 194 million in 2009 209 million in 2008 and 197 million in 2007 on our research and development activities or about 8 to 9 of our revenues each year we expect these expenditures to remain at this percentage level for 2010 of the amount expended in 2009 on such activities 62 was for fragrances and the balance was for flavors we employed 1091 persons in 2009 and 1146 persons in 2008 in such activities 

our business is not materially dependent upon any patents trademarks or licenses 

  

distribution 

distribution for both the flavors and fragrances business units is similar in that most of our sales are through our own sales force the flavors business operates from two sales offices in the united states and 38 sales offices in 30 foreign countries while the fragrances business operates from two sales offices in the united states and 36 sales offices in 29 foreign countries sales in additional countries are made through agents and distributors for the year ended december 31 2009 35 of our sales were to customers in europe africa and middle east “eame” 26 in north america 24 in greater asia and 15 in latin america

governmental regulation 

the manufacture and sale of our products are subject to regulation in the united states by the food and drug administration the department of agriculture the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms the environmental protection agency the occupational safety and health administration the drug enforcement administration and state authorities foreign subsidiaries are subject to similar regulation in a number of countries in particular the european union will require extensive chemical registration and testing over the next 8 years compliance with existing governmental requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment has not materially affected our operations earnings or competitive position in 2010 we expect to spend approximately 6 to 8 million on capital projects and approximately 18 million in operating expenses and governmental charges for the purpose of complying with such requirements 

raw material purchases 

we purchase roughly 10000 different raw materials from many sources all over the world the principal natural raw materials consist of essential oils extracts and concentrates which are derived from fruits vegetables flowers woods and other botanicals animal products and raw fruits the principal synthetic raw material purchases consist of organic chemicals we believe that alternate materials or alternate sources of materials are available to enable us to maintain our competitive position in the event of any interruption in the supply of raw materials from present sources 

competition 

we have more than 50 competitors in the world markets iff is one of the top four companies which together represent approximately 70 of the flavors and fragrances industry while no single factor is responsible our competitive position is based principally on the creative skills of our perfumers and flavorists the technological advances resulting from our research and development activities the quality of our customer service the support provided by our marketing and application groups and our understanding of consumers we believe that we are one of the largest companies producing and marketing on an international basis a wide range of fragrance and flavor products for sale to manufacturers of consumer products in particular countries and localities we face competition from numerous companies specializing in certain product lines among which are some companies larger than us and some more important in a particular product line or lines most of our customers do not buy all of their fragrance or flavor products from the same supplier and some customers make their own fragrance or flavor compounds with ingredients supplied by us or others

 item 1a risk factors tableend the following are some important factors that could cause the company’s actual results to differ materially from those referred to or implied in any forwardlooking statement these are in addition to the risks and uncertainties discussed elsewhere in this annual report of form 10k and in the company’s other filings with the securities and exchange commission 

the current volatility in global economic conditions and the financial markets may adversely affect our industry business and results of operations 

the volatility and disruption to the capital and credit markets since mid2008 has rapidly impacted global economic conditions resulting in significant recessionary pressures and declines in consumer confidence and economic growth these conditions have led to economic contractions in the developed economies and reduced growth rates in the emerging markets despite fiscal and monetary intervention it is possible that further declines in consumer spending and global growth rates may occur in the foreseeable future reduced consumer spending may cause changes in customer order patterns including order cancellations and changes in the level of inventory at our customers which may adversely affect our industry business and results of operations the impact of the credit crisis and economic slowdown will vary by region and country the diversity of our geographic customer and operating footprint limits our reliance and exposure to any single economy 

  

these conditions have also resulted in a substantial tightening of the credit markets including lending by financial institutions and in the commercial paper market both of which are sources of credit for our borrowing and liquidity this tightening of the credit markets has increased the cost of capital and reduced the availability of credit based on our latest discussions we believe that the financial institutions syndicated under our revolving credit facility are able to fulfill their commitments as of our filing date it is difficult to predict how long the current economic and capital and credit market conditions will continue whether they will continue to deteriorate and which aspects of our products or business could be adversely affected however if current levels of economic and capital and credit market disruption and volatility continue or worsen there can be no assurance that we will not experience an adverse impact which may be material on our business the cost of and access to capital and credit markets and our results of operations in addition we monitor the financial condition of our customers on a regular basis based on public information or data provided directly to us if the financial condition of one of our major customers was negatively impacted by market conditions or liquidity we could be adversely impacted in terms of accounts receivable andor inventory specifically attributable to them 

failure to maintain the integrity of our raw materials supply chain and finished goods may adversely impact sales and our results of operations iff’s reputation and litigation costs 

the manufacture and sale of our products are subject to various regulatory requirements in each of the countries in which our products are manufactured and sold in addition we are subject to product safety and compliance requirements established by the industry or similar oversight bodies we use a variety of strategies methodologies and tools to identify current products standards assess relative risks in our supply chain that can impact product integrity monitor internal and external performance and test raw materials and finished goods to minimize the likelihood of product noncompliance 

if a noncompliance event went undetected we could be subject to customer claims penalties litigation costs andor settlements remediation costs or loss of sales these consequences would be exacerbated if our customer did not identify the defect and there was a resulting impact at the consumer level this could lead to potentially large scale adverse publicity and potential consumer litigation 

competitive factors may negatively impact our sales and marketability 

the market for flavors and fragrances is fragmented and highly competitive iff competes with many companies and some of our competitors specialize in one or more of our product segments while others participate in many of the same segments in addition some of our competitors may have greater financial and technical resources the discovery and development of new flavor and fragrance materials protection of the company’s intellectual property and development and retention of key employees are important issues in our ability to compete in our businesses increased competition by existing or future competitors including aggressive price competition could result in the need for us to reduce prices or increase spending and this could have an impact on sales and profitability 

we are subject to economic and social changes which may impact sales 

demand for consumer products using flavors and fragrances has been stimulated and broadened by changing social habits resulting from factors such as increases in personal income dualearner households teenage population leisure time health concerns and urbanization and by the continued growth in world population changes in any number of external economic factors or changes in social or consumer preferences could adversely impact our results of operations nearly 60 of our sales occur in the developed markets of north america western europe and australasia with the remainder in emerging markets accordingly the impact on our operations will depend upon consumer spending on products for which we supply the flavor or fragrance in these global markets 

results may be negatively impacted by the price quality and availability of raw materials 

raw materials are purchased from many sources from all over the world including essential oils extracts and concentrates derived from fruits vegetables flowers woods and other botanicals animal products raw fruits 

  

and organic chemicals disruptions in the supply or quality of ingredients or rising prices for ingredients purchased could adversely impact our results of operations and profitability historically we have experienced the greatest amount of volatility in natural products that represent approximately 50 of raw material purchases availability and pricing of these products can be impacted by crop size and quality demand balance or alternative land use to mitigate our sourcing risk we maintain strategic stock levels covering multiple periods for critical items andor time purchases to capitalize on favorable market conditions 

results may be negatively impacted by the inability to implement our business strategy including the achievement of anticipated cost savings profitability or growth targets 

we are committed to those particular business strategies and market segments that have been identified as likely to drive profitable future growth and improve operations and customer service if we are unable to successfully and timely implement these strategies it would adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 

results may be negatively affected by the impact of currency fluctuation or devaluation in principal foreign markets and the effectiveness of hedging and risk management strategies 

our operations are conducted in many countries the results of which are reported in the local currency and then translated into us dollars at applicable exchange rates the exchange rates between these currencies and the us dollar have fluctuated and may continue to do so in the future we employ a variety of techniques to reduce the impact of exchange rate fluctuations including sourcing strategies and a limited number of foreign currency hedging activities however volatility in currency exchange rates may adversely impact our reported results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

results may be negatively impacted by the outcome of uncertainties related to litigation 

we are involved in a number of legal claims while we believe that related insurance coverage is adequate with respect to such claims we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of such litigation in addition we cannot provide assurance that future events will not result in an increase in the number of claims or require an increase in the amount accrued for any such claims or require accrual for one or more claims that has not been previously accrued 

results and cash flows may be negatively impacted by future pension funding and other postretirement obligations 

we establish assumptions concerning discount rates and actuarial assumptions regarding pension funding and other postretirement benefit obligations based on current market conditions plan participants asset returns interest rates and other factors changes in pension and other postretirement benefits plan assets and associated expenses may occur in the future due to changes in capital markets employee demographics and actuarial assumptions these changes may adversely impact our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

results may be negatively impacted by the effect of legal and regulatory requirements as well as restrictions imposed on operations by foreign and domestic governmental entities 

the manufacture and sale of our products are subject to regulation in the united states by the food and drug administration the department of agriculture the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms the environmental protection agency the occupational safety and health administration the drug enforcement administration and state authorities in addition we are subject to product safety and compliance requirements established by the industry or similar oversight bodies our foreign operations are subject to similar substantial governmental regulation and oversight standards in a number of countries including extensive requirements within the european union costs or investments necessary to maintain compliance with existing or future governmental regulations may adversely impact our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

  

we may face risks associated with events which may affect the world economy 

world events such as terrorist attacks or regional conflicts have and may in the future weaken world economies any resulting weaknesses in these economies may adversely affect our business or the businesses of our customers with a resultant negative impact on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

our success depends on attracting and retaining talented people within our business any shortfall in recruitment or retention could adversely affect our ability to compete and achieve our strategic goals 

attracting developing and retaining talented employees is essential to the successful delivery of our products and success in the marketplace however we cannot be certain that we will be able to attract and retain such employees in the future any shortfalls in recruitment or retention could adversely affect our ability to operate successfully grow our business and effectively compete with our competitors

at each balance sheet date or more frequently as conditions warrant the company reviews the status of each pending claim as well as its insurance coverage for such claims with due consideration given to potentially applicable deductibles retentions and reservation of rights under its insurance policies and the advice of its outside legal counsel and a third party expert in modeling insurance deductible amounts with respect to all of these matters while the ultimate outcome of any litigation cannot be predicted management believes that adequate provision has been made with respect to all known claims based on information presently available and in light of the merits of its defenses and the availability of insurance the company does not expect the outcome of the above cases singly or in the aggregate to have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition results of operation or liquidity there can be no assurance that future events will not require the company to increase the amount it has accrued for any matter or accrue for a matter that has not been previously accrued see note 16 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

over the past 20 years various federal and state authorities and private parties have claimed that the company is a potentially responsible party “prp” as a generator of waste materials for alleged pollution at a number of waste sites operated by third parties located principally in new jersey and have sought to recover costs incurred and to be incurred to clean up the sites 

the company has been identified as a prp at ten facilities operated by third parties at which investigation andor remediation activities may be ongoing the company analyzes its liability on a regular basis the company accrues for environmental liabilities when they are probable and estimable the company estimates its share of the total future cost for these sites to be less than 5 million 

while joint and several liability is authorized under federal and state environmental laws the company believes the amounts it has paid and anticipates paying in the future for cleanup costs and damages at all sites are not and will not be material to the company’s financial condition results of operations or liquidity this conclusion is based upon among other things the involvement of other prps at most sites the status of proceedings including various settlement agreements and consent decrees the extended time period over which payments will likely be made and an agreement reached in july 1994 with three of the company’s liability insurers pursuant to which defense costs and indemnity amounts payable by the company in respect of the sites will be shared by the insurers up to an agreed amount

 executive overview 

we are a leading creator and manufacturer of flavor and fragrance compounds used to impart or improve the flavor or fragrance in a wide variety of consumer products the precise size of the global market for flavors and fragrances is difficult to determine because the industry is highly fragmented both geographically and along product lines there are a limited number of publicly traded companies in the industry certain customers maintain inhouse capabilities fulfilling a portion of their flavor or fragrance needs and the quality and depth of market information in developing regions of the world is limited analysts generally estimate the global market to be 15 billion of which iff represents 16 the largest competitor in the industry has approximately a 25 market share iff is one of the top four companies which together represent approximately 70 of the flavors and fragrances industry 

iff is organized into two units that reflect our flavor and fragrance businesses approximately 46 of our 2009 net sales were flavor compounds flavor compounds are sold to the food and beverage industries for use in consumer products such as prepared foods beverages dairy food and confectionery products the remaining 54 of sales representing the fragrance business unit were in three fragrance categories functional fragrances including fragrance compounds for personal care eg soaps and household products eg detergents and cleaning agents fine fragrance and beauty care including perfumes colognes and toiletries and ingredients consisting of natural and synthetic ingredients that can be combined with other materials to create unique functional and fine fragrance compounds major fragrance customers include the cosmetics industry including perfume and toiletries manufacturers and the household products industry including manufacturers of soaps detergents fabric care household cleaners and air fresheners approximately 55 of our ingredient production is consumed internally the balance is sold to third party customers 

the underpinning of structural growth for the flavor and fragrance industry are population growth an expanding middle class and technology changing social habits resulting from such factors as increases in 

  

personal income leisure time health and wellness and urbanization stimulate demand for consumer products utilizing flavors and fragrances these developments also drive the creation and development of new molecules technologies andor solutions that facilitate and improve the enduse consumption of flavors and fragrances in consumer products 

flavors and fragrances are generally 

 

  

  

  

 the flavors and fragrances industry is impacted by macroeconomic factors in all product categories and geographic regions such factors include the impact of currency on the price of raw materials and operating costs as well as on translation of reported results in addition iff is susceptible to margin pressures due to customers’ cost improvement programs and input cost increases however these pressures can often be mitigated through a combination of product reformulation sourcing strategies and material substitution plus internal cost containment efforts and the development of innovative and streamlined solutions and processes 

we produce more than 33000 unique compounds of which approximately 60 are flavors and 40 fragrances we continually create new compounds to meet the changing characteristics and needs of our customers’ end products no single compound represents more than 2 of net sales development of flavors and fragrances is a complex artistic and technical process calling upon the combined knowledge and talents of creative perfumers and flavorists and application and research chemists an important element of creation is the development of new ingredients we bear essentially all costs incurred in connection with the creation and development of new flavors and fragrances and such formulae are generally protected under trade secrecy we are not materially dependent on any patents trademarks or licenses 

iff’s success in the flavors and fragrances industry is driven by our ability to create unique sensory experiences that meet evolving consumer needs and expectations these solutions are delivered in a costefficient manner in conjunction with worldclass customer service

sales commentary 

a breakdown of sales by principal product category is depicted in the graph below 

2009 sales by category 

our five largest customers comprise 33 of consolidated sales and our top 30 customers 57 these percentages have remained fairly constant for several years although sales to larger customers are trending higher we have one customer that accounts for 11 of our sales a key factor for commercial success is inclusion on the strategic customers’ core supplier lists opening opportunities to win new business we are on the core supplier lists of a large majority of our strategic customers 

net sales by business unit for 2009 2008 and 2007 were as follows 

 

 2009 sales by destination 

we manage our operations by global business units but utilize destination sales as a supplemental performance measure and indicator of underlying market trends although reported sales and earnings are affected by the weakening or strengthening of the us dollar this has not had a longterm effect on the underlying competitiveness of our business 

  

net sales by destination for 2009 2008 and 2007 were as follows 

 

  

 2009 in comparison to 2008 

sales for 2009 totaled 2326 million decreasing 3 from the prior year period of 2389 million as flavor sales declined 1 and fragrance sales decreased 4 foreign exchange had a 3 negative impact on reported sales during 2009 as the us dollar was stronger during the first threequarters of 2009 versus the comparable yearago period market conditions improved during the second half of 2009 as global economic conditions strengthened and customer inventory levels stabilized local currency lc sales increased over 2 during both the third and fourth quarters compared to a decline of 3 during the first six months of 2009 

flavors business unit 

flavor sales decreased 1 for 2009 compared to 2008 as the effects of a stronger us dollar soft demand and inventory corrections in europe and customer specific losses in latin america more than offset new wins solid demand and price increases in north america and greater asia excluding the impact of currencies sales for the flavors business increased over 2 during 2009 compared to 2008 

fragrances business unit 

fragrance sales decreased 4 for 2009 compared to 2008 reflecting doubledigit lc sales declines for fine fragrances as consumers reduced discretionary spending and the industry significantly reduced inventories across the supply chain these headwinds were partially offset by solid growth and new wins in beauty care toiletries and substantially all functional fragrance categories excluding the impact of currencies sales for the fragrances business declined 1 during 2009 compared to 2008 

sales by region and category 

regional and product category sales performance for 2009 compared to 2008 in reported dollars and local currency was as follows

 2008 in comparison to 2007 

sales totaled 2389 million for 2008 up 5 from 2007 flavor and fragrance sales increased 9 and 2 respectively 2008 sales benefited from the generally weaker us dollar and at comparable exchange rates would have increased 2 over the prior year 

flavors business unit 

flavor sales increased 9 for 2008 based on new wins across all regions particularly in the beverage category led by a 21 increase in latin america excluding the impact of currencies sales growth for the flavors business was 6 

fragrances business unit 

fragrance sales increased 2 excluding the impact of currencies fragrance sales declined 1 as strong growth in emerging markets was offset by weakness in the us market new product introductions of fragrance compounds were offset by volume declines primarily in the us and eame ingredient sales benefited from price increases partially offset by volume declines as part of a product rationalization initiative and weaker economies in the us and eame 

sales by region and category 

regional and product category sales performance for 2008 compared to the prior year in reported dollars and local currency was as follows

 consolidated operating results 

the percentage relationship of cost of goods sold and other operating expenses to reported sales is detailed as follows 

 

 cost of goods sold includes the cost of materials and manufacturing expenses raw materials generally constitute 70 of the total research and development expenses are for the development of new and improved products technical product support compliance with governmental regulations and help in maintaining relationships with customers who are often dependent on technological advances selling and administrative expenses support our sales and operating levels 

2009 in comparison to 2008 

cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales was 598 in 2009 compared with 594 in 2008 this increase reflects higher input costs a weaker sales mix principally related to fine fragrance and slightly lower absorption that could only be partially offset by cost recovery and productivity and margin improvement efforts including pricing 

research and development rd expenses were down 155 million in 2009 compared to the prior year mainly due to increased foreign rd credits of 8 million driven by program enhancements and additional qualifying expenditures the remaining reduction was due to tight cost control on applied research and development and the effects of a stronger us dollar partially offset by higher incentive compensation during 2008 and the first nine months of 2009 these credits were previously recognized as a reduction of tax expense 

selling and administrative expenses sa as a percentage of sales increased to 162 of sales during 2009 as compared to 160 during 2008 the 2009 results include 63 million of employee separation costs and expenses related to the change in ceo whereas the 2008 amount included the benefit of a 26 million insurance recovery related to a prior period product liability claim offset by 34 million for employee separation costs excluding these items sa declined 11 million and would have been flat at 159 as a percentage of sales the reduction in sa dollars reflects a stronger us currency and cost reduction efforts which more than offset higher pension expense higher incentive compensation expense and provision for product claims 

  

interest expense 

during 2009 interest expense totaled 618 million as compared to 740 million in 2008 the 2009 decrease reflects a lower average borrowing cost the elimination of a crosscurrency interest rate swap during the second half of 2008 and debt repayments during 2009 the 2009 amount includes 4 million of interest paid on the closeout of a crosscurrency interest rate swap classified as a net investment hedge average cost of debt was 55 for 2009 compared to 61 in 2008 

other income expense net 

other expense during 2009 was 19 million compared to other income of 28 million in 2008 approximately 50 of the change was mainly due to yearoveryear changes in foreign exchange gainslosses on trade receivables and payables during the year during 2008 the company recognized foreign exchange gains primarily during the fourth quarter as a result of the rapid strengthening of the us dollar usd during the period of financial turmoil during 2009 we saw a general weakening trend for the usd that has resulted in a higher level of foreign exchange losses on trade receivables and payables the remaining change was due to less favorable marktomarket adjustments on our investments 

income taxes 

the effective tax rate for the year 2009 was 293 compared to 191 during 2008 the 2008 period included a 23 million reduction in tax expense related primarily to prior period tax settlements versus 2 million during 2009 the 2009 results include 6 million of tax expense due to the recognition of outofperiod tax adjustments arising from periods 2006 and prior the company did not adjust the prior periods as it concluded that such adjustments were not material to the prior periods’ consolidated financial statements or to the current year excluding these items from both periods as well as the previously discussed restructuring charges the tax rate for 2009 was 274 compared to 275 for 2008 the change reflects 3 million of higher repatriation costs on foreign earnings offset by a net reduction of valuation allowances on certain deferred assets and the mix of earnings between high and low tax jurisdictions 

operating results by business unit 

we evaluate the performance of business units based on operating profit before gainslosses on the disposition of assets interest expense other income expense net and income taxes see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for the reconciliation to income before taxes 

flavors business unit 

in 2009 flavors operating profit totaled 208 million or 193 of sales compared to 198 million or 181 of sales in 2008 the operating profit improvement reflects increased prices ongoing cost discipline and cost recovery and margin improvement efforts which more than offset higher input costs and negative currency impacts the 2008 amount included 35 million of restructuring expenses versus 06 million in 2009 

fragrances 

in 2009 fragrance operating profit was 171 million or 137 of sales compared to 202 million or 156 of sales in 2008 the 2008 figure has been revised to reflect rd credits that were previously reflected as a reduction of tax expense the 2009 amount includes 18 million of restructuring related expenses compared to 4 million in 2008 during 2009 as part of the rationalization of our european fragrance manufacturing footprint we decided to close our fragrance compounding facility in ireland and partially close our ingredients plant in the united kingdom uk in addition we eliminated 60 positions to improve profitability 

the decline in profit was driven by significantly lower volumes in fine fragrances and ingredients higher input costs and unfavorable mix partially offset by improved pricing margin recovery efforts lower overhead expenses and 8 million of additional rd credits versus the prior year excluding the restructuring charges operating profit margins declined 70 basis points over the comparable prior year period 

  

global expenses 

global expenses represent corporate and headquartersrelated expenses which include legal finance human resources and other administrative expenses that are not allocated to an individual business unit in 2009 global expenses were 39 million compared to 45 million during 2008 in 2009 global expenses included 6 million of employee separation costs associated with the change in ceo global expenses in 2008 included approximately 10 million of restructuring charges and 3 million of employee separation costs and 2 million of implementation costs related to our global shared service structure partially offset by a 3 million insurance recovery related to prior period product liability claim excluding these items global expenses were flat indicative of strict cost control measures that offset inflationary pressure 

2008 in comparison to 2007 

cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales was 594 compared with 582 in 2007 this increase was mainly the result of higher input costs and lower absorption of manufacturing expenses most notably in north america fragrance compounds these factors were partially offset by internal efficiencies reformulation and material substitution efforts product mix notably lower sales of fine and beauty care compounds also impacted cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales 

research and development expense as a percentage of sales was 88 this increase over the prior year period reflects increasing investments in customer applications and basic research 

selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales was 160 in the current period compared to 165 in the prior year period the 2008 results included the benefit of a 3 million insurance recovery related to a 2005 product contamination matter offset by 3 million of employee separation costs the 2007 results included 4 million of business transformation costs that enabled us to better leverage our global sap software platforms the decline in selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales is mainly attributable to lower incentive compensation this was partially offset by 2 million related to the implementation of our global shared service structure 

interest expense 

interest expense totaled 74 million compared to 42 million in 2007 due to higher borrowings incurred in connection with the 2007 share repurchase activities as well as a wider spread between the libor london interbank offer rate and euribor european interbank offer rate interest rates applicable to our interest rate swaps average cost of debt was 61 for 2008 compared to 45 in 2007 

other income expense net 

other income was 3 million in 2008 as compared to 11 million in 2007 other income in 2007 included 11 million related to gains on asset sales 

income taxes 

the effective tax rate was 191 in 2008 as compared to a rate of 253 in the prior year the lower tax rate in 2008 primarily reflects the benefit of 23 million in higher tax settlements related to prior years versus 10 million during the 2007 period the decrease in 2008 also benefits from a higher proportion of earnings in lower tax jurisdictions

in 2008 flavors operating profit totaled 198 million or 181 as a percentage of sales compared to 187 million or 186 in 2007 the 2008 amount includes 35 million of restructuring expenses excluding the restructuring charge profitability was comparable year over year as strong sales growth augmented by lower incentive compensation expense was partially offset by unfavorable product mix 

fragrance business unit 

in 2008 fragrance operating profit of 202 million or 156 as a percentage of sales declined from the 212 million or 167 reported in 2007 the 2008 amount includes 44 million of restructuring expenses the decline in profit was driven by unfavorable absorption of manufacturing expenses from the shortfall in sales in north america as well as unfavorable mix with declining fine fragrance sales partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense 

global expenses 

global expenses represent corporate and headquartersrelated expenses which include legal finance human resources and other administrative expenses that are not allocated to an individual business unit as well as gains on asset sales and a pension curtailment charge in 2008 global expenses were 45 million as compared to 27 million in 2007 in 2008 global expenses included approximately 10 million of restructuring charges 3 million of employee separation costs and 2 million of implementation costs related to our global shared service structure partially offset by a 3 million insurance recovery related to a 2005 product contamination global expenses in 2007 included a 6 million curtailment loss related to changes to the us defined benefit pension plan and 11 million related to the gains on asset sales 

goodwill and intangible assets 

at december 31 2009 and 2008 goodwill and other intangible assets net of accumulated amortization totaled 721 million and 727 million respectively additional details are contained in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements 

we perform a goodwill impairment test on at least an annual basis or more frequently in certain circumstances by assessing the fair value of our reporting units based upon both discounted cash flow and comparison of multiples of comparable companies we deem goodwill to be impaired if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value we completed our annual assessments in 2009 and 2008 concluding there was no impairment of goodwill 

other intangible assets include patents trademarks and other intellectual property valued at acquisition primarily through independent appraisals which are amortized on a straightline basis over periods ranging from 6 to 20 years we review our other intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in business conditions indicate that their full carrying value may not be recovered 

restructuring and other charges 

restructuring and other charges primarily consist of separation costs for employees including severance outplacement and other benefit costs 

the company recorded a net pretax charge of 41 million during the second quarter ended june 30 2009 this amount includes 66 million for severance and related costs associated with the elimination of approximately 70 positions globally less a 25 million reduction to previously recorded provisions the reduction in prior reserves was attributable to lower estimated benefit costs on severance paid as well as fewer position eliminations requiring severance 

  

during september 2009 as part of the rationalization of our european fragrance manufacturing footprint the company announced that it had initiated a collective consultation process with employees regarding the closure of its fragrances compounding facility in drogheda ireland as well as the partial closure of its fragrance ingredients plant in haverhill uk the company has completed both consultation processes and has communicated its intent to proceed with the closures the company has now completed the negotiations with the haverhill employee representatives and is actively engaged in the negotiation process with the employee representatives in ireland to determine actual employee separation benefits 

as a result of these plans approximately 140 employees will be terminated during the third and fourth quarters of 2009 the company recorded a provision for severance costs of 122 million to “restructuring and other charges” in our consolidated statement of income based on reasonable expectations of separation benefits we expect to conclude the negotiations in early 2010 and will record any necessary adjustment then the company also recorded 10 million of accelerated depreciation on certain related assets and other restructuring related costs other restructuring costs discussed above will be recorded as incurred as the company moves forward with implementation in addition as part of our continual focus to optimize our european operations the flavors segment recorded a provision for contract termination costs of 10 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 

we expect to incur total costs related to this restructuring plan of approximately 2229 million consisting primarily of 1115 million of employee termination costs 810 million in plant shutdown and business transition costs and 34 million in asset impairments andor accelerated depreciation of related fixed assets while some cost savings could be realized in the latter half of 2010 the estimated annual cost savings benefit of 1720 million is not expected to be fully realized until 2011 

in 2008 as part of our business transformation initiative to enable us to better leverage our global sap software platform we implemented a plan to centralize transaction processing in a global shared service structure that resulted in the elimination of 127 positions globally largely in the finance area as a result of these actions we recognized a pretax charge of approximately 7 million in 2008 related to employee separation costs and 2 million in implementation costs the implementation costs were included in selling and administrative expenses in 2008 in addition we incurred a pretax charge of approximately 12 million in the fourth quarter 2008 principally related to a performance improvement plan covering 91 positions across a variety of activities globally annual savings from these 2008 initiatives is expected to be approximately 14 million realization of which began in 2009 

positions eliminated and charges net of reversal by business segment in 2009 and 2008 are detailed in the table below there were no such actions undertaken in 2007 

 

   

movements in related accruals in each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2009 were 

 

 the remaining employeerelated liabilities are expected to be utilized by 2011 as obligations are satisfied 

income taxes 

effective utilization of the cash generated by our international operations is a critical component of our tax strategy strategic dividend repatriation from foreign subsidiaries creates us taxable income which enables us to recognize deferred tax assets 

pursuant to asc 740 “income taxes” we establish a valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets if based on the weight of the available evidence it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized historically we have provided a full valuation allowance against deferred tax assets resulting from state net operating losses and state credits as well as selective nonus affiliates’ net operating losses the changes in the valuation allowances from december 31 2008 are primarily attributable to the current period net operating losses and currency translation adjustments 

postretirement benefits 

in 2007 we recorded a curtailment loss of 59 million to recognize a portion of the unrecognized prior service costs associated with years of service no longer expected to be rendered and credited as service under the plans as a result of an amendment to the us salaried qualified and nonqualified pension plans we also introduced an enhanced defined contribution plan for those employees affected by the pension curtailment that became effective january 1 2008 

financial condition 

cash and cash equivalents totaled 80 million at december 31 2009 compared to 178 million at december 31 2008 working capital totaled 643 million at yearend 2009 compared to 751 million at december 31 2008 the 2009 decrease in working capital was primarily related to improvements associated with inventory management past due balances on receivables and standardized processing of payables gross additions to property plant and equipment were 67 million 85 million and 66 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively and are expected to approximate 4 of sales in 2010 the planned increase in 2010 is mainly attributable to investments needed to support growth in emerging markets 

our financial condition continues to be strong as evidenced by substantial cash flow from operations and substantial drawdown capacity of approximately 500 million on our multiyear revolving credit facility operating cash flow provides the primary source of funds for operating and capital needs as well as dividends paid to shareholders and share repurchase activities we anticipate that cash flows from operations and 

  

availability under our existing credit facilities are sufficient to fund our capital spending and other cash requirements for at least the next eighteen months we regularly assess our capital structure including both current and longterm debt instruments as compared to our cash generation and investment needs in order to provide ample flexibility 

operating cash flow in 2009 was 292 million compared to 221 million and 314 million in 2008 and 2007 respectively the improvement in operating cash flows during 2009 was led by the reduction of our inventories which was driven by our internal process improvement initiatives combined with better operating discipline over receivables and payables we expect to make additional operational gains in working capital management going forward operating cash flows in 2008 benefited from the receipt of 18 million on termination of an interest rate swap the decrease in other assets and liabilities was driven by longterm incentive plan payments lower deferred taxes and pension and other postretirement payments 

net investing activities in 2009 utilized 81 million compared to 90 million and 51 million in 2008 and 2007 respectively the reduction in 2009 funds used compared to 2008 reflects a 20 million decline in capital spending partially offset by a 14 million payment to terminate a net investment hedge in europe 

compliance with existing governmental requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment has not materially affected our operations earnings or competitive position in 2009 and 2008 we spent 4 million in each year on capital projects and 17 million and 19 million respectively in operating expenses and governmental charges for the purpose of complying with such regulations expenditures for these purposes will continue for the foreseeable future in addition we are party to a number of proceedings brought under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act or similar state statutes it is expected that the impact of any judgments in or voluntary settlements of such proceedings will not be material to our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

the dividend paid per share in 2009 2008 and 2007 was 100 94 and 86 respectively in january 2009 april 2009 july 2009 and october 2009 we funded a quarterly cash dividend of 025 per share to shareholders in january april and july 2008 we paid a quarterly cash dividend of 23 per share to shareholders we paid dividends totaling 79 million 75 million and 77 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 our current intention is to pay dividends approximating 30 – 35 of yearly earnings however the payment of dividends is determined by the board of directors “board” at its discretion based on various factors and no assurance can be provided as to future dividends 

we supplement shortterm liquidity with access to capital markets mainly through bank credit facilities and issuance of commercial paper in 2005 iff including certain subsidiaries entered into a revolving credit agreement the “facility” with certain banks the facility provides for a us 350 million “tranche a” and euro 400 million “tranche b” multicurrency revolving credit facility tranche a is available to iff for commercial paper backstop and general corporate purposes tranche b is available to both iff and the european subsidiaries for general corporate purposes borrowings under the facility bear interest at an annual rate of libor or in relation to any eurodenominated loans euribor plus a margin currently 25 basis points linked to our credit rating we pay a commitment fee on the aggregate unused commitments and a utilization fee based on amounts outstanding under the facility such fees are not material the facility expires on november 23 2012 during 2008 the maximum amount of outstanding commercial paper was 30 million we did not issue commercial paper during 2009 

at december 31 2009 we had 1012 million of debt outstanding compared to 1256 million outstanding at december 31 2008 we regularly assess our capital structure including both current and longterm debt instruments as compared to our cash generation and investment needs in order to provide ample flexibility in that connection in december 2009 we prepaid without penalty the remaining outstanding balance approximately 151 million of our japanese yen loan — 2008 which was scheduled to mature in 2011 total debt repayments during 2009 amounted to approximately 240 million 

  

in october 2008 we closed out a 250 million usd libor to euribor interest rate swap and a 250 million fixed to floating interest rate swap at no cost additionally in february 2009 we terminated a 300 million usd libor to euribor interest rate swap which required us to make a payment of 16 million see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk item 7a below for additional information regarding these transactions 

during the year ended december 31 2009 we repurchased 75000 shares on the open market at a cost of 2 million or an average of 2622 per share for the year ended december 31 2008 we repurchased 7 million shares of our common stock at a cost of 30 million on the open market for the year ended december 31 2007 we repurchased 26 million shares of our common stock in the open market at a cost of 127 million plus an additional 76 million shares under the asr 

in july 2007 our board authorized us to repurchase up to 15 or 750 million worth of our then outstanding common stock whichever is less in september 2007 under the july 2007 plan we entered into two agreements to purchase shares of our common stock under a 450 million accelerated share repurchase “asr” program the asr concluded in june 2008 total aggregate shares repurchased under the asr program were 97 million shares at an average purchase price of 4653 the asr was primarily funded through the issuance of 500 million of senior unsecured notes “senior notes — 2007” in four series under a note purchase agreement see note 8 borrowings to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding these notes 

the facility contains the most restrictive covenant requiring us to maintain at the end of each fiscal quarter a ratio of net debt for borrowed money to adjusted ebitda in respect of the previous 12month period of not more than 325 to 1 

at december 31 2008 we were in compliance with all financial and other covenants at december 31 2009 our net debtadjusted ebitda 1 was 208 to 1 as defined by the debt agreements well below the financial covenants of existing outstanding debt failure to comply with the financial and other covenants under these agreements would constitute default and would allow the lenders to accelerate the maturity of all indebtedness under the related agreement if such acceleration were to occur we would not have sufficient liquidity available to repay the indebtedness we would likely have to seek amendments under the agreements for relief from the financial covenants or repay the debt with proceeds from the issuance of new debt or equity andor asset sales if necessary we may be unable to amend the agreements or raise sufficient capital to repay such obligations in the event the maturities are accelerated 

 

  

   

 at december 31 2009 we had contractual payment obligations due within the time periods as specified in the following table 

 

  

    the table above does not include 65 million of the total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions and approximately 10 million of associated accrued interest due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential cash flows the company is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid 

critical accounting policies and use of estimates 

our accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements as disclosed in note 1 the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and accompanying disclosures these estimates are based on management’s best judgment of current events and actions that we may undertake in the future actual results may ultimately differ from estimates 

those areas requiring the greatest degree of management judgment or deemed most critical to our financial reporting involve 

the periodic assessment of potential impairment of intangible assets acquired in business combinations  we currently have net intangible assets including goodwill of 721 million goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually in assessing goodwill management uses the most current actual and forecasted operating data available and current market based assumptions a twostep approach is 

  

employed the first step involves estimating the value of reporting units based on the present value of estimated future cash flows the second step if necessary is to measure the value of the impairment loss if any management’s most subjective assumptions relate to the estimatedprojected sales and operating growth values employed in the forecast 

the analysis and evaluation of income taxes  we account for taxes in accordance with asc 740 under asc 740 deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities based on tax laws as currently enacted the provision for income taxes is based on statutory income tax rates and planning opportunities available in the various tax jurisdictions where we operate significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and tax positions we may be challenged upon review by the applicable taxing authority and positions taken by us may not be sustained we regularly update these accruals in light of changing facts and circumstances 

in 2007 we adopted guidance presented in asc 740 formally “fin 48” as a result of this guidance we recognized a 1 million increase in other liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and a corresponding cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings 

the evaluation of potential legal and environmental liabilities where changing circumstances rules and regulations require regular reassessment of related practices and anticipated costs we are subject to certain legal claims regarding products and other matters as well as environmentalrelated matters significant management judgment is involved in determining when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the extent to which it can be reasonably estimated 

we regularly assess potential liabilities with respect to all legal claims based on the most recent available information in consultation with outside counsel handling the defense of such matters to the extent a liability is deemed to have been incurred and can be reasonably estimated we recognize a corresponding liability if the reasonably estimated liability is a range we recognize that amount considered most likely or in the absence of such a determination the minimum reasonably expected liability to the extent such claims are covered by various insurance policies we separately evaluate the likelihood of recovery and account for any related insurance receivable management judgments involve determination as to whether a liability has been incurred the reasonably estimated amount of that liability and any potential insurance recovery 

we regularly evaluate potential environmental exposure in terms of total estimated cost and the viability of other potentially responsible parties “prp’s” associated with our exposure recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress and additional information becomes available critical management assumptions relate to expected total costs to remediate and the financial viability of prp’s to share such costs 

determination of the various assumptions employed in the valuation of pension and retiree health care expense and associated obligations amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined from actuarial valuations inherent in such valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets discount rates at which the liabilities could be settled rates of increase in future compensation levels mortality rates and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore affect expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods 

we consider a number of factors in determining and selecting assumptions for the overall expected longterm rate of return on plan assets we consider the historical longterm return experience of our assets the current and expected allocation of our plan assets and expected longterm rates of return we derive these expected longterm rates of return with the assistance of our investment advisors we base our expected allocation of plan assets on a diversified portfolio consisting of domestic and international equity securities fixed income real estate and alternative asset classes 

  

we consider a variety of factors in determining and selecting our assumptions for the discount rate at december 31 for the us plans the discount rate was based on the internal rate of return for a portfolio of moody’s aaa aa and merrill lynch aaaaa high quality bonds with maturities that are consistent with the projected future benefit payment obligations of the plan the rate of compensation increase for all plans and the medical cost trend rate for the applicable us plans are based on plan experience 

with respect to the us plans the expected return on plan assets was determined based on an asset allocation model using the current target allocation real rates of return by asset class and an anticipated inflation rate the target asset allocation consists of approximately 60 – 65 in equity securities and 35 – 40 in fixed income securities the inflation rate assumed in the model was 25 the plan has achieved a compounded annual rate of return of approximately 8 over the previous 20 years at december 31 2009 the actual asset allocation was 67 in equity securities 30 in fixed income securities and 3 in cash 

the expected annual rate of return for the nonus plans employs a similar set of criteria adapted for local investments inflation rates and in certain cases specific government requirements the target asset allocation for the nonus plans consists of approximately 55 – 60 in fixed income securities 30 – 35 in equity securities 5 – 10 in real estate and up to 5 in cash at december 31 2009 the actual asset allocation was 57 in fixed income investments 30 in equity investments 11 in real estate investments and 2 in cash 

management establishes the assumptions concerning discount rates and actuarial assumptions based on current market conditions including asset returns and other factors applicable under the circumstances changes in pension and other postemployment benefits and associated expenses may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions the impact that a 25 decrease in the discount rate or a 1 change in the medical cost trend rate would have on our pension and other postemployment benefit expense as applicable is discussed in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements 

the ongoing assessment of the valuation of inventory given the large number of natural ingredients employed the quality of which may be diminished over time  we maintain between 40 and 55 of our inventory as raw materials providing the greatest degree of flexibility in manufacture and use materials are evaluated based on shelf life known uses and anticipated demand based on forecasted customer order activity and changes in productsales mix management policy provides for an ongoing assessment of inventory with adjustments recorded when an item is deemed to be slow moving or obsolete 

determination of various assumptions employed in the calculation of equity compensation expense  amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to equity compensation are determined based on the number of awards and type of award as well as specific assumptions regarding expected life stock price volatility risk free interest rate termination rates exercise multiple and the dividend yield these assumptions are employed in the binomial model used to value certain awards management establishes the assumptions based on current market conditions and historical trends related to the equity awards 

developing the assumptions used in the binomial model requires significant judgment on our part and generally may involve analyzing available historical data considering whether historical data is relevant to predicting future behavior making appropriate adjustments to historical data for future expectations supplementing or replacing companyspecific historical data with data from other supportable sources and appropriately weighting each of the inputs these assumptions are evaluated at each grant date if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating sharebased compensation expense in future periods or if we decide to use a different valuation model the future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect operating income net income and net income per share 

we believe that we have considered relevant circumstances that we may be currently subject to and the financial statements accurately reflect our best estimate of the results of our operations financial condition and cash flows for the years presented we have discussed the decision process and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 

  

new accounting standards 

in june 2009 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued its fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles the “codification” or “asc” the codification became the single source of authoritative us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities the codification now supersedes thenexisting accounting and reporting standards such as fasb statements fasb staff positions “fsp” and emerging issues task force abstracts the codification which is effective for our financial statements beginning with our third quarter of 2009 impacts only our financial statement reference disclosures and does not change application of gaap 

in may 2009 the fasb issued authoritative guidance which sets forth general standards of accounting for and the disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued this guidance was effective beginning with our second quarter of 2009 and has not had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements in that regard we have performed an evaluation of subsequent events through february 25 2010 which is the date the financial statements were issued 

in april 2009 the fasb issued authoritative guidance requiring disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments in annual and interim reporting periods of publicly traded companies the quarterly disclosures are intended to provide financial statement users with more timely information about the effects of current market conditions on an entity’s financial instruments that are not otherwise reported at fair value this guidance is effective for interim reporting periods beginning with our second quarter of 2009 the adoption of this guidance had no impact on our financial position or results of operations 

as of december 31 2009 we adopted new authoritative guidance which expands the disclosure requirements related to the plan assets of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans with the intent to provide users of financial statements with an enhanced understanding of i how investment allocation decisions are made including the investment policies and strategies used ii the major categories of plan assets iii the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets iv the effect of fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs level 3 on changes in plan assets and v significant concentrations of risk within plan assets the additional disclosures required by this guidance are included in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements 

as of january 1 2009 we adopted new authoritative guidance issued by the fasb which requires us to classify our noncontrolling interest in consolidated subsidiaries previously referred to as minority interest as a separate component of shareholders’ equity through december 31 2008 such noncontrolling interest had been included in other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet any applicable income expense attributable to the noncontrolling interest is included in other income expense net in the accompanying consolidated statement of income due to its immateriality and as such is not included separately in comprehensive income 

as of january 1 2009 we adopted new authoritative guidance issued by the fasb which amends and expands previously required disclosure requirements about derivative instruments and hedging activities the new guidance requires enhanced disclosures regarding the objectives and strategies for using derivatives how derivative instruments are accounted for and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position financial performance and cash flows the adoption of the new guidance had no impact on our financial position or results of operations the additional disclosures required by this guidance are included in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 

as of january 1 2009 we adopted new authoritative guidance issued by the fasb related to “participating securities granted in sharebased payment transactions” this guidance considers unvested sharebased payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents whether paid or unpaid as participating securities and requires them to be included in the computation of basic earnings per share pursuant 

  

to the twoclass method described in the codification the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and is explained in detail in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

nongaap financial measures 

the company uses nongaap financial operating measures which exclude employee separation costs including costs associated with the change in the chief executive officer position in 2009 and restructuring charges including costs associated with the company’s ongoing restructuring efforts in europe in 2009 benefits of favorable tax rulings and settlements relating to prior years the benefit of an insurance recovery costs for the implementation of the global shared services structure in 2008 and the gain on the sale of land and a curtailment charge resulting from changes made to our us defined benefit pension plan in 2007 in addition in certain instances we exclude the effects of exchange rate fluctuations when discussing our historical performance the company also discloses from time to time nongaap effective tax rates which exclude the effect of the benefits of tax rulings relating to prior periods as additional information in seeking to assess and compare our tax rates without the benefit of those tax rulings such information is supplemental to information presented in accordance with gaap and is not intended to represent a presentation in accordance with gaap in discussing our historical and expected future results and financial condition we believe it is meaningful for investors to be made aware of and to be assisted in a better understanding of on a periodtoperiod comparative basis of financial amounts both including and excluding these identified items as well as the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on operating results and financial condition we believe such additional nongaap information provides investors with an overall perspective of the periodtoperiod performance of our core business in addition management internally reviews each of these nongaap measures to evaluate performance on a comparative periodtoperiod basis in terms of absolute performance trends and expected future performance with respect to our core continuing business a material limitation of these nongaap measures is that such measures do not reflect actual gaap amounts restructuring charges employee separation costs and implementation costs include actual cash outlays an insurance recovery is an actual cash recovery and benefits from favorable tax rulings and settlements reflect actual accounting and cash benefits realized and we compensate for such limitations by presenting the accompanying reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measure these nongaap measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we operate on a global basis and are exposed to currency fluctuation related to the manufacture and sale of our products in currencies other than the us dollar the major foreign currencies involve the markets in the european union great britain mexico brazil china india indonesia australia and japan although all regions are subject to foreign currency fluctuations versus the us dollar we actively monitor our foreign currency exposures in all major markets in which we operate and employ a variety of techniques to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations including foreign currency hedging activities we enter into foreign currency forward contracts with the objective of reducing exposure to cash flow volatility associated with foreign currency receivables and payables and with anticipated purchases of certain raw materials used in operations these contracts the counterparties to which are major international financial institutions generally involve the exchange of one currency for a second currency at a future date and have maturities not exceeding six months the notional amount and maturity dates of such contracts match those of the underlying transactions the gain or loss on the hedging instrument and services is recorded in earnings at the same time as the transaction being hedged is recorded in earnings in february 2003 we executed a 10year yen — us dollar currency swap related to the monthly sale and purchase of products and services between the us and japan which is designated as a cash flow hedge the annual notional value of this swap is approximately 5 million the associated asset or liability on the open hedge instrument is recorded in current assets or current liabilities as applicable gains and losses related to this swap are recorded currently and the marktomarket adjustment related to the value of the swap is reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income “aoci” 

in addition to the foreign exchange forward contracts noted above we have used nonus dollar borrowings and foreign exchange swap agreements to hedge the foreign currency exposures of our net investment in certain foreign affiliates primarily in the european union these foreign exchange swap agreements are designated as hedges of net investments in september 2007 and january 2006 we entered into a 250 million and a 300 million cross currency interest rate swap respectively to hedge a portion of our consolidated eur net investment the derivative was structured as a swap of floating usd libor to floating euribor with both floating interest rates reset and paid semiannually because the derivative is structured as a floating to floating swap the only value other than that derived from changes in the spot foreign exchange fx rate are interest rate accruals which are reset semiannually these accruals are netted and booked in current earnings marktomarket changes due to differences in the underlying fx rate are recorded in aoci and provide an offset to the cumulative translation adjustment of the underlying euro net investments being hedged in october 2008 we closed out the 250 million usd libor to euribor interest rate swap at no cost in february 2009 we terminated the 300 million usd libor to euribor interest rate swap which required us to make a payment of 16 million as this swap was designated as a net investment hedge 12 million of the loss was deferred in aoci where it will remain until the euro net investment is divested and 4 million was included as a component of interest expense during the year ended december 31 2009 

we use derivative instruments as part of our interest rate risk management strategy the derivative instruments used are comprised principally of fixed to floating rate interest rate swaps in september 2007 we entered into a 250 million interest rate swap agreement effectively converting the fixed rate on our longterm us dollar borrowings to a variable shortterm rate based on usd libor rate plus markup in march 2008 we realized an 18 million gain on termination of this swap which has been deferred and is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining term of the related debt during 2008 we entered into a similar interest rate swap and then in october 2008 we liquidated this position at no cost 

in addition in 2005 we entered into certain interest rate swap agreements effectively converting the fixed rate on our longterm japanese yen borrowings to a variable shortterm rate based on the japanese yen tibor rate plus markup these swaps are designated as qualified fair value hedges in november 2008 the portion of these swaps related to the 133 billion yen notes refinanced expired swap contracts are generally held to maturity and are intended to create an appropriate balance of fixed and floating rate debt to the extent we have not received cash or otherwise amended or settled any swap agreements any applicable marktomarket adjustment relating to that swap is included as a separate component of debt 

  

the following table summarizes our derivatives outstanding as of december 31 2009 these swaps were all effective under asc 815 

 

  

method used to test for effectiveness 

 

  we have established a centralized reporting system to evaluate the effects of changes in interest rates currency exchange rates and other relevant market risks our risk management procedures include the monitoring of interest rate and foreign exchange exposures and hedge positions utilizing statistical analyses of cash flows market value and sensitivity analysis however the use of these techniques to quantify the market risk of such instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of their accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions market exposures are evaluated using a sensitivity model that is intended to measure the potential 10 loss in interest rate and foreign exchange financial instruments assuming adverse market conditions occur historical interest rates and foreign exchange rates are used to estimate the volatility and correlation of future rates 

the estimated maximum potential oneday loss in fair value of interest rate or foreign exchange rate instruments calculated using the sensitivity model is not material to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows in 2009 2008 and 2007 the estimated maximum yearly loss in earnings due to interest rate or foreign exchange rate instruments calculated utilizing the sensitivity model is not material to our results of operations in 2009 2008 and 2007 actual results in the future may differ materially from these projected results due to actual developments in the global financial markets 

the foreign currency and interest rate swap contracts existing during 2008 and 2007 were entered into for the purpose of seeking to mitigate the risk of certain specific adverse currency and interest rate risks as a result of these financial instruments we reduced financial risk in exchange for foregoing any gain reward that might have occurred if the markets moved favorably in using these contracts management exchanged the risks of the financial markets for counterparty risk counterparty risk arises from the inability of a counterparty to meet its obligations to mitigate counterparty risk we entered into derivative contracts with major leading financial institutions that have credit ratings equal to or better than our credit rating

products 

 

our principal fragrance and flavor products consist of compounds of large numbers of ingredients blended in proprietary formulas created by our perfumers and flavorists most of these compounds contribute the total fragrance or flavor to the consumer products in which they are used this fragrance or flavor characteristic is often a major factor in the consumer selection and acceptance of the consumer end product a smaller number of compounds are sold to manufacturers who further blend them to achieve the finished fragrance or flavor in their products we produce thousands of compounds and new compounds are constantly being created in order to meet the many and changing characteristics of our customers’ end products most of the fragrance and flavor compounds are created and produced for the exclusive use of particular customers our products are sold in powder and liquid forms and in amounts ranging from a few pounds to many tons depending upon the nature of the product 

 

the ingredients that we use in our compounds are both synthetic and natural we manufacture a substantial portion of the synthetic ingredients while a majority of our synthetic ingredients production is used in our compounds a substantial portion is also sold to others natural ingredients are derived from flowers fruits and other botanical products as well as from animal products they contain varying numbers of organic chemicals which are responsible for the fragrance or flavor of the natural product the natural products are purchased in processed or semiprocessed form some are used in compounds in the state in which they are purchased and others after further processing natural products together with various chemicals are also used as raw materials for the manufacture of 

synthetic ingredients by chemical processes our flavor products also include extracts and seasonings derived from various fruits vegetables nuts herbs and spices as well as microbiologicallyderived ingredients 

 

market developments 

 

the demand for consumer products utilizing flavors and fragrances has been stimulated and broadened by changing social habits resulting from various factors such as increases in personal income dualearner households teenage population leisure time urbanization health and wellness concerns including increased demand for nature based products and by the continued growth of emerging markets in the fragrance field these developments have expanded the market for hair care candles and air care products and deodorant and personal wash products with finer fragrance quality as well as the market for colognes toilet waters men’s toiletries and other products beyond traditional luxury items such as perfumes in the flavor field similar market characteristics have stimulated the demand for products such as convenience foods soft drinks and lowfat and organic food products that must conform to expected tastes new and improved methods of packaging applying and dispensing have been developed for many consumer products that utilize some of our flavor or fragrance products these developments have called for the creation of new compounds and ingredients compatible with the newly introduced materials and methods of application 

 

product development and research 

 

the development of new flavors and fragrances is a complex technical and artistic process calling upon the combined knowledge and skill of our creative perfumers and flavorists and our scientists with extensive experience the perfumers and flavorists continuously advance their skills for creating fragrances or flavors best suited to the market requirements of the customers’ products 

 

scientists from various disciplines work in project teams with the perfumers and flavorists to develop flavor and fragrance products with consumer preferred performance characteristics scientific expertise includes natural products research plant science organic chemistry analytical chemistry biochemistry microbiology process engineering food science material science and sensory science analytical and sensory science is applied to understand the complex interactions of the many ingredients in a consumer product in order to optimize the flavor or fragrance performance at all points of use material science technology is applied to create controlled release and delivery systems to enhance flavor and fragrance performance in consumer products an important contribution to the creation of new flavors and fragrances is the discovery and development of new ingredients having improved fragrance or flavor value the ingredients research program discovers molecules found in natural substances and creates new molecules that are subsequently tested for their fragrance or flavor value the new molecules that meet rigorous requirements for commercial development are subsequently transferred to manufacturing operations for production 

 

creative and technical product development is conducted in 32 fragrance and flavor laboratories in 24 countries we maintain a research and development center at union beach new jersey we spent 213 million in 2008 199 million in 2007 and 186 million in 2006 on our research and development activities or about 9 of our revenues each year we expect these expenditures to remain at approximately 9 of our revenues in 2009 of the amount expended in 2008 on such activities 64 was for fragrances and the balance was for flavors we employed 1146 persons in 2008 and 1132 persons in 2007 in such activities

 item 1a risk factors 

 

the following are some important factors that could cause the company’s actual results to differ materially from those referred to or implied in any forwardlooking statement these are in addition to the risks and uncertainties discussed elsewhere in this annual report of form 10k and in the company’s other filings with the securities and exchange commission 

 

the current volatility in global economic conditions and the financial markets may adversely affect our industry business and results of operations 

 

the volatility and disruption to the capital and credit markets since mid2008 has rapidly impacted global economic conditions resulting in significant recessionary pressures and declines in consumer confidence and economic growth these conditions have led to economic contractions in the developed economies and reduced growth rates in the emerging markets despite fiscal and monetary intervention it is possible that further declines in consumer spending and global growth rates may occur in the foreseeable future reduced consumer spending may cause changes in customer order patterns including order cancellations and changes in the level of inventory at our customers which may adversely affect our industry business and results of operations the impact of the credit crisis and economic slowdown will vary by region and country the diversity of our geographic customer and operating footprint limits our reliance and exposure to any single economy 

 

these conditions have also resulted in a substantial tightening of the credit markets including lending by financial institutions and in the commercial paper market both of which are sources of credit for our borrowing and liquidity this tightening of the credit markets has increased the cost of capital and reduced the availability of credit based on our latest discussions we believe that the financial institutions syndicated under our revolving credit facility are able to fulfill their commitments as of our filing date it is difficult to predict how long the current economic and capital and credit market conditions will continue whether they will continue to deteriorate and which aspects of our products or business could be adversely affected however if current levels of economic and capital and credit market disruption and volatility continue or worsen there can be no assurance that we will not experience an adverse impact which may be material on our business the cost of and access to capital and credit markets and our results of operations in addition we monitor the financial condition of our customers on a regular basis based on public information or data provided directly to us if the financial condition of one of our major customers was negatively impacted by market conditions or liquidity we could be adversely impacted in terms of accounts receivable andor inventory specifically attributable to them 

 

failure to maintain the integrity of our raw materials supply chain and finished goods may adversely impact sales and our results of operations 

 

the manufacture and sale of our products are subject to various regulatory requirements in each of the countries in which our products are manufactured and sold in addition we are subject to product safety and compliance requirements established by the industry or similar oversight bodies we use a variety of strategies methodologies and tools to identify current products standards assess relative risks in our supply chain that can impact product integrity monitor internal and external performance test raw materials and finished goods to minimize the likelihood of product noncompliance if a noncompliance event went undetected we could be subject to customer claims penalties litigation costs andor settlements remediation costs or loss of sales 

 

competitive factors may negatively impact our sales and marketability 

 

the market for flavors and fragrances is fragmented and highly competitive iff competes with many companies and some of our competitors specialize in one or more of our product segments while others participate 

in many of the same segments in addition some of our competitors may have greater financial and technical resources increased competition by existing or future competitors including aggressive price competition could result in the need for us to reduce prices or increase spending and this could have an impact on sales and profitability 

 

we are subject to economic and social changes which may impact sales 

 

demand for consumer products using flavors and fragrances has been stimulated and broadened by changing social habits resulting from factors such as increases in personal income dualearner households teenage population leisure time health concerns and urbanization and by the continued growth in world population changes in any number of external economic factors or changes in social or consumer preferences could adversely impact our results of operations approximately 60 of our sales occur in the developed markets of north america western europe and australasia with the remainder in emerging markets accordingly the impact on our operations will depend upon consumer spending on products for which we supply the flavor or fragrance in these global markets 

 

results may be negatively impacted by the price quality and availability of raw materials 

 

raw materials are purchased from many sources from all over the world including essential oils extracts and concentrates derived from fruits vegetables flowers woods and other botanicals animal products raw fruits and organic chemicals disruptions in the supply or quality of ingredients or rising prices for ingredients purchased could adversely impact our results of operations and profitability historically we have experienced the greatest amount of volatility in natural products that represent approximately 50 of raw material purchases availability and pricing of these products can be impacted by crop size and quality demand balance or alternative land use to mitigate our sourcing risk we maintain strategic stock levels covering multiple periods for critical items andor time purchases to capitalize on favorable market conditions 

 

results may be negatively impacted by the inability to implement our business strategy including the achievement of anticipated cost savings profitability or growth targets 

 

we are committed to those particular business strategies and market segments that have been identified as likely to drive profitable future growth and improve operations and customer service if we are unable to successfully and timely implement these strategies it would adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 

 

results may be negatively affected by the impact of currency fluctuation or devaluation in principal foreign markets and the effectiveness of hedging and risk management strategies 

 

our operations are conducted in many countries the results of which are reported in the local currency and then translated into us dollars at applicable exchange rates the exchange rates between these currencies and the us dollar have fluctuated and may continue to do so in the future we employ a variety of techniques to reduce the impact of exchange rate fluctuations including sourcing strategies and a limited number of foreign currency hedging activities however volatility in currency exchange rates may adversely impact our reported results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

 

results may be negatively impacted by the outcome of uncertainties related to litigation 

 

we are involved in a number of legal claims while we believe that related insurance coverage is adequate with respect to such claims we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of such litigation in addition we cannot provide assurance that future events will not require an increase in the amount accrued for any such claims or require accrual for one or more claims that has not been previously accrued 

results and cash flows may be negatively impacted by future pension funding and other postretirement obligations 

 

we establish assumptions concerning discount rates and actuarial assumptions regarding pension funding and other postretirement benefit obligations based on current market conditions plan participants asset returns interest rates and other factors changes in pension and other postretirement benefits plan assets and associated expenses may occur in the future due to changes in capital markets employee demographics and actuarial assumptions these changes may adversely impact our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

 

results may be negatively impacted by the effect of legal and regulatory requirements as well as restrictions imposed on operations by foreign and domestic governmental entities 

 

the manufacture and sale of our products are subject to regulation in the united states by the food and drug administration the agriculture department the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms the environmental protection agency the occupational safety and health administration the drug enforcement administration and state authorities in addition we are subject to product safety and compliance requirements established by the industry or similar oversight bodies our foreign operations are subject to similar substantial governmental regulation and oversight standards in a number of countries including extensive requirements within the european union costs or investments necessary to maintain compliance with existing or future governmental regulations may adversely impact our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

 

we may face risks associated with events which may affect the world economy 

 

world events such as terrorist attacks or regional conflicts have and may in the future weaken world economies any resulting weaknesses in these economies may adversely affect our business or the businesses of our customers with a resultant negative impact on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity

over the past approximately 20 years various federal and state authorities and private parties have claimed that the company is a potentially responsible party “prp” as a generator of waste materials for alleged pollution at a number of waste sites operated by third parties located principally in new jersey and have sought to recover costs incurred and to be incurred to clean up the sites 

 

the company has been identified as a prp at ten facilities operated by third parties at which investigation andor remediation activities may be ongoing the company analyzes its liability on a regular basis the company accrues for environmental liabilities when they are probable and estimable the company estimates its share of the total future cost for these sites to be less than 5 million 

 

while joint and several liability is authorized under federal and state environmental laws the company believes the amounts it has paid and anticipates paying in the future for cleanup costs and damages at all sites are not and will not be material to the company’s financial condition results of operations or liquidity this conclusion is based upon among other things the involvement of other prps at most sites the status of proceedings including various settlement agreements and consent decrees the extended time period over which payments will likely be made and an agreement reached in july 1994 with three of the company’s liability insurers pursuant to which defense costs and indemnity amounts payable by the company in respect of the sites will be shared by the insurers up to an agreed amount

management’s discussion and analysis provides a narrative on our operating performance financial condition and liquidity and should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements it includes the following sections 

 

  

executive overview 

 

we are a leading creator and manufacturer of flavor and fragrance compounds used to impart or improve the flavor or fragrance in a wide variety of consumer products the precise size of the global market for flavors and fragrances is difficult to determine because the industry is highly fragmented both geographically and along product lines there are a limited number of publicly traded companies in the industry certain customers maintain inhouse capabilities fulfilling a portion of their flavor or fragrance needs and the quality and depth of market information in developing regions of the world is limited analysts generally estimate the global market to be 14 billion of which iff represents 16 the largest competitor in the industry has approximately a 25 market share iff is one of the top four companies which together represent 70 of the flavors and fragrances industry 

 

iff is organized into two units that reflect our flavor and fragrance businesses approximately 46 of our 2008 net sales were flavor compounds flavor compounds are sold to the food and beverage industries for use in consumer products such as prepared foods beverages dairy food and confectionery products the remaining 54 of sales representing the fragrance business unit were in three fragrance categories functional fragrances including fragrance compounds for personal care eg soaps and household products eg detergents and cleaning agents fine fragrance and beauty care including perfumes colognes and toiletries and ingredients consisting of natural and synthetic ingredients that can be combined with other materials to create unique functional and fine fragrance compounds major fragrance customers include the cosmetics industry including perfume and toiletries manufacturers and the household products industry including manufacturers of soaps detergents fabric care household cleaners and air fresheners approximately 55 of our ingredient production is consumed internally the balance is sold to third party customers 

 

changing social habits resulting from such factors as increases in personal income leisure time health concerns urbanization and population growth stimulate demand for consumer products utilizing flavors and fragrances these developments expand the market for products with finer fragrance quality as well as the market for colognes and toiletries such developments also stimulate demand for convenience foods soft drinks and low 

fat and organic food products that must conform to expected tastes these developments necessitate the creation and development of flavors and fragrances and ingredients that are compatible with newly introduced materials and methods of application used in consumer products 

 

flavors and fragrances are generally 

 

  

the flavors and fragrances industry is impacted by macroeconomic factors in all product categories and geographic regions such factors include the impact of currency on the price of raw materials and operating costs as well as on translation of reported results in addition iff is susceptible to margin pressures due to customers’ cost improvement programs and input cost increases however these pressures can often be mitigated through a combination of product reformulation sourcing strategies and material substitution plus internal cost containment efforts and the development of innovative and streamlined solutions and processes 

 

we produce more than 33000 unique compounds of which approximately 60 are flavors and 40 fragrances we continually create new compounds to meet the changing characteristics and needs of our customers’ end products no single compound represents more than 2 of net sales development of flavors and fragrances is a complex artistic and technical process calling upon the combined knowledge and talents of creative perfumers and flavorists and application and research chemists an important element of creation is the development of new ingredients we bear essentially all costs incurred in connection with the creation and development of new flavors and fragrances and such formulae are generally protected under trade secrecy we are not materially dependent on any patents trademarks or licenses 

 

iff’s success in the flavors and fragrances industry is driven by our ability to create unique sensory experiences that meet evolving consumer needs and expectations these solutions are delivered in a costefficient manner in conjunction with worldclass customer service

people 

 

as a leading creator of flavors and fragrances our ability to succeed is highly dependent on our greatest asset — our people we continue to invest considerable time and resources in developing our leaders to build iff for the longterm

iff continues to focus on creating innovative processes technologies and delivery systems which includes a significant financial commitment to research and development we see potential to gain market share by providing 

unique solutions to our customers that enable their brands to win in the marketplace in addition by streamlining internal processes we are better able to allocate resources to appropriate initiatives 

 

as implementation of our strategy progresses setting strategic initiatives requires regular establishment and reassessment of priorities and necessitates choices in order to provide the best opportunity for continuous improvement in shareholder value 

 

sales commentary

our five largest customers comprise 32 of consolidated sales and our top 30 customers 56 these percentages have remained fairly constant for several years although sales to larger customers are trending higher we have one customer that accounts for 11 of our sales a key factor for commercial success is inclusion on the strategic customers’ core supplier lists opening opportunities to win new business we are on the core supplier lists of a majority of our strategic customers

consolidated operating results 

 

the percentage relationship of cost of goods sold and other operating expenses to reported sales is detailed as follows 

 

 

 

cost of goods sold includes the cost of materials and manufacturing expenses raw materials generally constitute 70 of the total research and development expenses are for the development of new and improved products technical product support compliance with governmental regulations and help in maintaining relationships with customers who are often dependent on technological advances selling and administrative expenses support our sales and operating levels 

 

2008 in comparison to 2007 

 

cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales was 594 compared with 582 in 2007 this increase was mainly the result of higher input costs and lower absorption of manufacturing expenses most notably in north america fragrance compounds these factors were partially offset by internal efficiencies reformulation and material substitution efforts product mix notably lower sales of fine and beauty care compounds also impacted cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales 

 

research and development expense as a percentage of sales was 89 this increase over the prior year period reflects increasing investments in customer applications and basic research 

 

selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales was 160 in the current period compared to 165 in the prior year period the 2008 results included the benefit of a 3 million insurance recovery related to a 2005 product contamination matter offset by 3 million of employee separation costs the 2007 results included 4 million of business transformation costs that enabled us to better leverage our global sap software platforms the decline in selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales is mainly attributable to lower incentive compensation this was partially offset by 2 million related to the implementation of our global shared service center 

 

interest expense 

 

interest expense totaled 74 million compared to 42 million in 2007 due to higher borrowings incurred in connection with the 2007 share repurchase activities as well as a wider spread between the libor london interbank offer rate and euribor european interbank offer rate interest rates applicable to our interest rate swaps average cost of debt was 61 for 2008 compared to 45 in 2007 

other income expense net 

 

other income was 3 million in 2008 as compared to 11 million in 2007 other income in 2007 included 11 million related to gains on asset sales 

 

income taxes 

 

the effective tax rate was 181 in 2008 as compared to a rate of 248 in the prior year the lower tax rate in the current year primarily reflects the benefit of higher tax settlements related to prior years and a higher proportion of earnings in lower tax jurisdictions the 2008 rate includes a 23 million benefit primarily tax settlements related to prior years the 2007 rate includes 10 million of similar benefits 

 

operating results by business unit 

 

we evaluate the performance of business units based on operating profit before gainslosses on the disposition of assets interest expense other income expense net and income taxes see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for the reconciliation to income before taxes 

 

flavors business unit

fragrance business unit 

 

in 2008 fragrance operating profit of 199 million or 153 as a percentage of sales declined from the 210 million or 165 reported in 2007 the 2008 amount includes 44 million of restructuring expenses the decline in profit was driven by unfavorable absorption of manufacturing expenses from the shortfall in sales in north america as well as unfavorable mix with declining fine fragrance sales partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense 

 

global expenses 

 

global expenses represent corporate and headquartersrelated expenses which include legal finance human resources and other administrative expenses that are not allocated to an individual business unit as well as gains on asset sales and a pension curtailment charge in 2008 global expenses were 45 million as compared to 27 million in 2007 in 2008 global expenses included approximately 10 million of restructuring charges 3 million of employee separation costs and 2 million of implementation costs related to our global shared service center partially offset by a 3 million insurance recovery related to a 2005 product contamination global expenses in 2007 included a 6 million curtailment loss related to changes to the us defined benefit pension plan and 11 million related to the gains on asset sales 

 

2007 in comparison to 2006 

 

cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales was 582 compared with 578 in 2006 this increase was mainly as a result of product mix notably higher sales of fragrance ingredients and flavor compounds lower selling prices for fragrance ingredients some impact of higher material costs and under absorption of manufacturing costs at a new fragrance ingredient facility in china which scaled up production in 2007 also contributed to the increase the average cost of raw materials increased 23 over the prior year 

 

research and development expense as a percentage of sales was 87 comparable to the prior year levels 

 

selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales was 165 in the period compared to 168 in the prior year period reflecting good cost control and the benefit of headcount reductions that occurred in the first half of 2006 selling and administrative expenses in 2007 include 4 million of business transformation costs to 

enable us to better leverage our global sap software platform the 2006 results also included the benefit of a 3 million insurance recovery related to a 2005 product contamination matter excluding the insurance recovery 2006 selling and administrative expenses would have been 169 of sales for the year 

 

interest expense 

 

in 2007 interest expense totaled 42 million increasing 63 compared to 2006 due to higher borrowings incurred in connection with share repurchase activities see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the share repurchase activities average cost of debt was 45 for 2007 compared to 33 in 2006 

 

other income expense net 

 

other income expense net in 2007 increased 1 million over the prior year mainly due to favorable exchange results and higher interest income as a result of higher interest rates other income included 11 million and 15 million in 2007 and 2006 respectively primarily related to gains on asset sales 

 

income taxes 

 

the effective tax rate was 248 in 2007 as compared to a rate of 277 in the prior year both the 2007 and 2006 rates benefited from favorable tax rulings with respect to prior years excluding the benefit of these rulings from both years the 2007 effective tax rate would have been 278 compared to a rate of 288 for 2006 the lower effective tax rate for the current year was largely the result of a greater percentage of consolidated pretax earnings in lower tax jurisdictions 

 

operating results by business unit 

 

we evaluate the performance of business units based on operating profit before gainslosses on the disposition of assets interest expense other income expense net and income taxes see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for the reconciliation to income before taxes 

 

flavors business unit 

 

in 2007 flavors operating profit of 187 million or 186 as a percentage of sales increased as compared to 153 million or 171 in 2006 the amount reported in 2006 benefited from a 3 million insurance recovery related to a 2005 product contamination matter excluding the insurance recovery from the prior year comparative flavors profitability would have increased an additional 30 basis points over 2006 this profitability improvement was primarily driven by margin improvement enabled by strong sales growth favorable product mix increased absorption of manufacturing expenses and good cost control 

 

fragrance business unit 

 

in 2007 fragrance operating profit of 210 million or 165 as a percentage of sales declined from the 212 million or 177 reported in 2006 profitability was negatively impacted by lower selling prices of fragrance ingredients higher material costs and underabsorption of manufacturing costs related to scaling up the china facility in 2007 

 

global expenses 

 

global expenses represent corporate and headquartersrelated expenses which include legal finance human resources and other administrative expenses that are not allocated to an individual business unit as well as gains on asset sales and a pension curtailment charge in 2007 global expenses increased 9 million to 27 million from 18 million incurred in 2006 in 2007 global expenses included approximately 6 million of curtailment loss as a result of changes to the us defined benefit pension plan and approximately 11 million related to gains on asset sales the 2006 expenses included approximately 15 million of other income primarily related to gains on asset sales 

goodwill and intangible assets 

 

at december 31 2008 and 2007 goodwill and other intangible assets net of accumulated amortization totaled 727 million and 733 million respectively additional details are contained in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

we perform a goodwill impairment test on at least an annual basis or more frequently in certain circumstances by assessing the fair value of our reporting units based upon both discounted cash flow and comparison of multiples of comparable companies we deem goodwill to be impaired if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value we completed our annual assessments in 2008 and 2007 concluding there was no impairment of goodwill 

 

other intangible assets include patents trademarks and other intellectual property valued at acquisition primarily through independent appraisals which are amortized on a straightline basis over periods ranging from 6 to 20 years we review our other intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in business conditions indicate that their full carrying value may not be recovered 

 

restructuring and other charges 

 

restructuring and other charges primarily consist of separation costs for employees including severance outplacement and other benefit costs 

 

in 2008 as part of our business transformation initiative to enable us to better leverage our global sap software platform we implemented a plan to centralize transaction processing in a global shared service center that resulted in the elimination of 127 positions globally largely in the finance area as a result of these actions we recognized a pretax charge of approximately 7 million in 2008 related to employee separation costs and 2 million in implementation costs the implementation costs were included in selling and administrative expenses in 2008 in addition we incurred a pretax charge of approximately 12 million in the fourth quarter 2008 principally related to a performance improvement plan covering 91 positions across a variety of activities globally annual savings from these two initiatives is expected to be approximately 14 million beginning in 2009 

 

the 2006 charge primarily related to employee separation expenses in connection with the consolidation of our operations principally in europe and north america 

 

positions eliminated and charges net of reversal by business segment in 2008 and 2006 are detailed in the table below there were no such actions undertaken in 2007 

 

 

movements in related accruals in each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2008 were 

 

 

 

the remaining employeerelated liabilities are expected to be utilized by 2010 as obligations are satisfied 

 

income taxes 

 

effective utilization of the cash generated by our international operations is a critical component of our tax strategy strategic dividend repatriation from foreign subsidiaries creates us taxable income which enables us to recognize deferred tax assets 

 

pursuant to fas 109 we establish a valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets if based on the weight of the available evidence it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized historically we have provided a full valuation allowance against deferred tax assets resulting from state net operating losses and state credits as well as selective nonus affiliates’ net operating losses the changes in the valuation allowances from december 31 2007 are primarily attributable to the current period net operating losses and currency translation adjustments 

 

postretirement benefits 

 

in 2007 we recorded a curtailment loss of 59 million to recognize a portion of the unrecognized prior service costs associated with years of service no longer expected to be rendered and credited as service under the plans as a result of an amendment to the us salaried qualified and nonqualified pension plans we also introduced an enhanced defined contribution plan for those employees affected by the pension curtailment that became effective january 1 2008 these events resulted in approximately 4 million of annual savings 

 

the global credit crisis has significantly increased volatility in the financial markets the financial returns of our investment trusts during 2008 have been inline with the markets by asset class we had little exposure to financial equities and had no direct investments in subprime related assets we do not expect the recent market declines to have a significant impact on our overall funding position as well as the timing and level of contributions 

 

financial condition 

 

cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaled 179 million at december 31 2008 compared to 152 million and 115 million at december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively working capital totaled 710 million at yearend 2008 compared to 613 million at december 31 2007 the 2008 increase in working capital was primarily related to decreases in shortterm borrowings and accrued bonuses the 2007 working capital amount was reduced by 39 million from the amount previously reported to conform to the 2008 presentation of deferred taxes assets and liabilities gross additions to property plant and equipment were 85 million 66 million and 58 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively and are expected to approximate 100 million in 2009 

our financial condition continues to be strong as evidenced by substantial cash flow from operations and substantial drawdown capacity of approximately 415 million on our multiyear revolving credit facility operating cash flow provides the primary source of funds for operating and capital needs as well as dividends paid to shareholders and share repurchase activities we anticipate that cash flows from operations and availability under our existing credit facilities are sufficient to fund our capital spending and other cash requirements for at least the next eighteen months 

 

operating cash flow in 2008 was 221 million compared to 314 million and 282 million in 2007 and 2006 respectively the decline in operating cash flow in 2008 compared to the prior year was primarily attributable to increased working capital and higher interest payments principally related to 500 million of senior unsecured notes we issued to repurchase stock as discussed below 

 

net investing activities in 2008 utilized 90 million compared to 51 million and 48 million in 2007 and 2006 respectively the increase in investing activities was primarily related to higher capital spending and lower proceeds from asset dispositions 

 

in 2007 and 2006 we realized sizeable cash proceeds from the sale of assets in both years the proceeds related to the sale of land and buildings to the extent such assets had been written down in connection with previous restructuring activities any gain or loss on disposition was accounted for as part of the restructuring activities all transactions were with third party investors and we retained no ownership interest in any of the disposed assets 

 

compliance with existing governmental requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment has not materially affected our operations earnings or competitive position in 2008 and 2007 we spent 4 million and 3 million respectively on capital projects and 19 million and 18 million respectively in operating expenses and governmental charges for the purpose of complying with such regulations expenditures for these purposes will continue for the foreseeable future in addition we are party to a number of proceedings brought under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act or similar state statutes it is expected that the impact of any judgments in or voluntary settlements of such proceedings will not be material to our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

 

the dividend paid per share in 2008 2007 and 2006 was 94 86 and 74 respectively in january april and july 2008 we paid a quarterly cash dividend of 23 per share to shareholders in july 2008 we announced a 9 increase in our quarterly dividend rate to 25 per share effective with the dividend payable in october 2008 we paid dividends totaling 75 million 77 million and 67 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 our current intention is to pay dividends approximating 30 — 35 of yearly earnings however the payment of dividends is determined by the board of directors “board” at its discretion based on various factors and no assurance can be provided as to future dividends 

 

we supplement shortterm liquidity with access to capital markets mainly through bank credit facilities and issuance of commercial paper in 2005 iff including certain subsidiaries entered into a revolving credit agreement the “facility” with certain banks the facility provides for a fiveyear us 350 million “tranche a” and euro 400 million “tranche b” multicurrency revolving credit facility tranche a is available to iff for commercial paper backstop and general corporate purposes tranche b is available to both iff and the european subsidiaries for general corporate purposes borrowings under the facility bear interest at an annual rate of libor or in relation to any eurodenominated loans euribor plus a margin currently 20 basis points linked to our credit rating we pay a commitment fee on the aggregate unused commitments and a utilization fee based on amounts outstanding under the facility such fees are not material the facility expires on november 23 2012 during 2008 and 2007 the maximum amount of outstanding commercial paper was 30 million and 18 million respectively 

 

at december 31 2008 we had 1256 million of debt outstanding which is comparable to the 1213 million outstanding at december 31 2007 in november 2008 ¥ 133 billion of our japanese yen borrowings were replaced with a threeyear bank loan in connection with this refinancing the related interest rate swaps expired in october 2008 we closed out a 250 million usd libor to euribor interest rate swap and a 250 million fixed to floating interest rate swap at no cost additionally in february 2009 we terminated a 300 million usd libor to 

euribor interest rate swap which required us to make a payment of 16 million see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk item 7a below for additional information regarding these transactions 

 

in july 2007 our board authorized us to repurchase up to 15 or 750 million worth of our then outstanding common stock whichever is less in september 2007 under the july 2007 plan we entered into two agreements to purchase shares of our common stock under a 450 million accelerated share repurchase “asr” program the asr concluded in june 2008 total aggregate shares repurchased under the asr program were 97 million shares at an average purchase price of 4653 the asr was primarily funded through the issuance of 500 million of senior unsecured notes “senior notes — 2007” in four series under a note purchase agreement see note 8 borrowings to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding these notes 

 

the facility and yen loan contain the most restrictive covenants requiring us to maintain at the end of each fiscal quarter a ratio of net debt for borrowed money to adjusted ebitda in respect of the previous 12month period of not more than 325 to 1 

 

at december 31 2008 we were in compliance with all financial and other covenants at december 31 2008 our net debt adjusted ebitda1 was 234 to 1 as defined by the debt agreements 

 

failure to comply with the financial and other covenants under these agreements would constitute default and would allow the lenders to accelerate the maturity of all indebtedness under the related agreement if such acceleration were to occur we would not have sufficient liquidity available to repay the indebtedness we would likely have to seek amendments under the agreements for relief from the financial covenants or repay the debt with proceeds from the issuance of new debt or equity andor asset sales if necessary we may be unable to amend the agreements or raise sufficient capital to repay such obligations in the event the maturities are accelerated 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

for the year ended december 31 2008 we repurchased 7 million shares of our common stock at a cost of 30 million on the open market for the year ended december 31 2007 we repurchased 26 million shares of our common stock in the open market at a cost of 127 million plus an additional 76 million shares under the asr 

at december 31 2008 we had contractual payment obligations due within the time periods as specified in the following table 

 

 

 

 

  

critical accounting policies and use of estimates 

 

our accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements as disclosed in note 1 the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and accompanying disclosures these estimates are based on management’s best judgment of current events and actions that we may undertake in the future actual results may ultimately differ from estimates 

 

those areas requiring the greatest degree of management judgment or deemed most critical to our financial reporting involve 

 

the periodic assessment of potential impairment of intangible assets acquired in business combinations  we currently have net intangible assets including goodwill of 727 million goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually in assessing goodwill management uses the most current actual and forecasted operating data available and current market based assumptions a twostep approach is employed the first step involves estimating the value of reporting units based on the present value of estimated future cash flows the second step if necessary is to measure the value of the impairment loss if any management’s most subjective assumptions relate to the estimatedprojected sales and operating growth values employed in the forecast 

 

the analysis and evaluation of income taxes we account for taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 109 “accounting for income taxes” “fas 109” under fas 109 deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities based on tax laws as currently enacted the provision for income taxes is based on statutory income taxes rates and planning opportunities available in the various tax jurisdictions where we operate significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and tax positions we may be challenged upon review by the applicable taxing authority and positions taken by us may not be sustained we regularly update these accruals in light of changing facts and circumstances 

in 2007 we adopted sfas no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” an interpretation of fas 109 “fin 48” as a result of adopting fin 48 we recognized a 1 million increase in other liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and a corresponding cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings also as prescribed by fin 48 certain tax related amounts in the consolidated balance sheet are classified differently than in prior periods amounts receivable from various tax jurisdictions are now included in other current assets and tax reserves previously classified as accrued taxes on income are now included in other liabilities 

 

the evaluation of potential legal and environmental liabilities where changing circumstances rules and regulations require regular reassessment of related practices and anticipated costs we are subject to certain legal claims regarding products and other matters as well as environmentalrelated matters significant management judgment is involved in determining when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the extent to which it can be reasonably estimated 

 

we regularly assess potential liabilities with respect to all legal claims based on the most recent available information in consultation with outside counsel handling the defense of such matters to the extent a liability is deemed to have been incurred and can be reasonably estimated we recognize a corresponding liability if the reasonably estimated liability is a range we recognize that amount considered most likely or in the absence of such a determination the minimum reasonably expected liability to the extent such claims are covered by various insurance policies we separately evaluate the likelihood of recovery and account for any related insurance receivable management judgments involve determination as to whether a liability has been incurred the reasonably estimated amount of that liability and any potential insurance recovery 

 

we regularly evaluate potential environmental exposure in terms of total estimated cost and the viability of other potentially responsible parties “prp’s” associated with our exposure recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress and additional information becomes available critical management assumptions relate to expected total costs to remediate and the financial viability of prp’s to share such costs 

 

determination of the various assumptions employed in the valuation of pension and retiree health care expense and associated obligations amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined from actuarial valuations inherent in such valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets discount rates at which the liabilities could be settled rates of increase in future compensation levels mortality rates and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore affect expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods 

 

with respect to the us plans the expected return on plan assets was determined based on an asset allocation model using the current benchmark allocation real rates of return by asset class and an anticipated inflation rate the benchmark asset allocation was 10 — 20 in cash and fixed income investments expected to yield 10 10 — 20 employed in corporate and government bonds expected to yield 21 and 65 — 75 in equity investments with a longterm expected yield of 85 — 93 the inflation rate assumed in the model was 25 the plan has achieved a compounded annual rate of return of approximately 9 over the previous 20 years the expected annual rate of return for the nonus plans employs a similar set of criteria adapted for local investments inflation rates and in certain cases specific government requirements the discount rate used for determining future pension obligations for each individual plan is based on a review of longterm bonds that receive a high rating from a recognized rating agency additionally for the us plans the discount rate was based on the internal rate of return for a portfolio of moody’s aa3rated high quality bonds with maturities that are consistent with the projected future benefit payment obligations of the plan the rate of compensation increase for all plans and the medical cost trend rate for the applicable us plans are based on plan experience 

 

management establishes the assumptions concerning discount rates and actuarial assumptions based on current market conditions including asset returns and other factors applicable under the circumstances changes in pension and other postemployment benefits and associated expenses may occur in the future due 

to changes in these assumptions the impact that a 25 decrease in the discount rate or a 1 change in the medical cost trend rate would have on our pension and other postemployment benefit expense as applicable is discussed in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

the ongoing assessment of the valuation of inventory given the large number of natural ingredients employed the quality of which may be diminished over time we maintain between 40 and 55 of our inventory as raw materials providing the greatest degree of flexibility in manufacture and use materials are evaluated based on shelf life known uses and anticipated demand based on forecasted customer order activity and changes in productsales mix management policy provides for an ongoing assessment of inventory with adjustments recorded when an item is deemed to be slow moving or obsolete 

 

determination of various assumptions employed in the calculation of equity compensation expense amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to equity compensation are determined based on the number of awards and type of award as well as specific assumptions regarding expected life stock price volatility risk free interest rate termination rates exercise multiple and the dividend yield these assumptions are employed in the binomial model used to value certain awards management establishes the assumptions based on current market conditions and historical trends related to the equity awards 

 

developing the assumptions used in the binomial model requires significant judgment on our part and generally may involve analyzing available historical data considering whether historical data is relevant to predicting future behavior making appropriate adjustments to historical data for future expectations supplementing or replacing companyspecific historical data with data from other supportable sources and appropriately weighting each of the inputs these assumptions are evaluated at each grant date if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating sharebased compensation expense in future periods or if we decide to use a different valuation model the future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect operating income net income and net income per share 

 

we believe that we have considered relevant circumstances that we may be currently subject to and the financial statements accurately reflect our best estimate of the results of our operations financial condition and cash flows for the years presented we have discussed the decision process and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 

 

new accounting standards 

 

in december 2007 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 141 revised 2007 “business combinations” “fas 141r” fas 141r requires the measurement at fair value of assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree as of the acquisition date sfas 141r also requires that acquisition related costs and costs to restructure be expensed as incurred we do not expect the adoption of fas 141r which is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december 15 2008 to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements a significant impact may however result from any future business acquisitions 

 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 160 “noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 51” “fas 160”  fas 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary it also amends certain of arb no 51’s consolidation procedures for consistency with the requirements of fas 141r this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december 15 2008 and shall be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the year of adoption we do not expect the adoption of fas 160 to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 

 

in march 2008 the fasb issued sfas no 161 “disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 133” “fas 161” fas 161 amends and expands the disclosure requirements of sfas no 133 with the intent to provide users of financial statements with an enhanced understanding of i how and why an entity uses derivative instruments ii how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under sfas 133 and its related interpretations and iii how derivative 

instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position statements this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2008 with early application encouraged we are currently evaluating the impact of fas 161 on the disclosures in our consolidated financial statements 

 

in may 2008 the fasb issued sfas no 162 “the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles” “fas 162” fas 162 identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles to be used in the preparation of financial statements presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america fas 162 will be effective 60 days following the sec’s approval of the public company accounting oversight board pcaob amendments to au section 411 “the meaning of present fairly in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles” we are currently evaluating the potential impact of fas 162 but do not believe its adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

 

in june 2008 the fasb issued fasb staff position “fsp” emerging issues task force “eitf” no 0361 “determining whether instruments granted in sharebased payment transactions are participating securities” “fsp eitf 0361” which classifies unvested sharebased payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents whether paid or unpaid as participating securities and requires them to be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the twoclass method described in sfas no 128 “earnings per share” this staff position is to be applied retrospectively and is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 we have issued purchase restricted stock “prs” to certain eligible employees the unvested portion of such prs contains a nonforfeitable right to dividends paid by us and as such are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the twoclass method we are currently evaluating the potential impact of fsp eitf 0361 but do not believe its adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

 

in december 2008 the fasb issued fsp fas no 132r1 “employers’ disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets” “fsp fas 132r1” fsp fas 132r1 expands the disclosure requirements of fas no 132r with the intent to provide users of financial statements with an enhanced understanding of i how investment allocation decisions are made including the investment policies and strategies used ii the major categories of plan assets iii the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets iv the effect of fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs level 3 on changes in plan assets and v significant concentrations of risk within plan assets this statement is to be applied prospectively effective for fiscal years ending after december 15 2009 with early application permitted we are currently evaluating the impact of fsp fas 132r1 on the disclosures in our consolidated financial statements 

 

nongaap financial measures 

 

among the items in gaap earnings but excluded for purposes of determining adjusted earnings are benefits of favorable tax rulings relating to prior years employee separation and restructuring charges the benefit of an insurance recovery costs for the implementation of the global shared services plan in 2008 and the gain on the sale of land a curtailment charge resulting from changes made to our us defined benefit pension plan in 2007 in addition in certain instances we exclude the effects of exchange rate fluctuations when discussing our historical performance such information is supplemental to information presented in accordance with gaap and is not intended to represent a presentation in accordance with gaap in discussing our historical and expected future results and financial condition we believe it is meaningful for investors to be made aware of and to be assisted in a better understanding of on a periodtoperiod comparative basis of financial amounts both including and excluding these identified items as well as the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on operating results and financial condition we believe such additional nongaap information provides investors with an overall perspective of the periodtoperiod performance of our core business in addition management internally reviews each of these nongaap measures to evaluate performance on a comparative periodtoperiod basis in terms of absolute performance trends and expected future performance with respect to our core continuing business a material limitation of these nongaap measures is that such measures do not reflect actual gaap amounts restructuring charges employee separation costs and implementation costs include actual cash outlays an insurance recovery is an actual cash recovery and benefits from favorable tax rulings reflect actual accounting and cash benefits realized and we compensate for such limitations by presenting the accompanying reconciliation to the most directly comparable 

gaap measure these nongaap measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

we operate on a global basis and are exposed to currency fluctuation related to the manufacture and sale of our products in currencies other than the us dollar the major foreign currencies involve the markets in the european union great britain mexico brazil china indonesia australia and japan although all regions are subject to foreign currency fluctuations versus the us dollar we actively monitor our foreign currency exposures in all major markets in which we operate and employ a variety of techniques to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations including foreign currency hedging activities we enter into foreign currency forward contracts with the objective of reducing exposure to cash flow volatility associated with foreign currency receivables and payables and with anticipated purchases of certain raw materials used in operations these contracts the counterparties to which are major international financial institutions generally involve the exchange of one currency for a second currency at a future date and have maturities not exceeding six months the notional amount and maturity dates of such contracts match those of the underlying transactions the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recorded in earnings at the same time as the transaction being hedged is recorded in earnings in february 2003 we executed a 10year yen  us dollar currency swap related to the monthly sale and purchase of products between the us and japan which is designated as a cash flow hedge the annual notional value of this swap is approximately 5 million the associated asset or liability on the open hedge instrument is recorded in current assets or current liabilities as applicable gains and losses related to this swap are recorded currently and the marktomarket adjustment related to the value of the swap is reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income “aoci” 

in addition to the foreign exchange forward contracts noted above we use nonus dollar borrowings and foreign exchange swap agreements to hedge the foreign currency exposures of our net investment in certain foreign affiliates primarily in the european union these foreign exchange swap agreements are designated as hedges of net investments in september 2007 and january 2006 we entered into a 250 million and a 300 million cross currency interest rate swap respectively to hedge a portion of our consolidated eur net investment the derivative was structured as a swap of floating usd libor to floating euribor with both floating interest rates reset and paid semiannually because the derivative is structured as a floating to floating swap the only value other than that derived from changes in the spot foreign exchange fx rate are interest rate accruals which are reset semiannually these accruals are netted and booked in current earnings marktomarket changes due to differences in the underlying fx rate are recorded in aoci and provide an offset to the cumulative translation adjustment of the underlying euro net investments being hedged effectiveness is assessed quarterly at maturity or if the swaps are terminated early any gain or loss will not be recorded to earnings but will be recorded to aoci until the eur net investment is divested in october 2008 we closed out the 250 million usd libor to euribor interest rate swap at no cost in february 2009 we terminated the 300 million usd libor to euribor interest rate swap which required us to make a payment of 16 million 

 

we use derivative instruments as part of our interest rate risk management strategy the derivative instruments used are comprised principally of fixed to floating rate interest rate swaps in september 2007 we entered into a 250 million interest rate swap agreement effectively converting the fixed rate on our longterm us dollar borrowings to a variable shortterm rate based on usd libor rate plus markup in march 2008 we realized an 18 million gain on termination of this swap which has been deferred and is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining term of the related debt during 2008 we entered into a similar interest rate swap and then in october 2008 we liquidated this position at no cost 

 

in addition in 2005 we entered into certain interest rate swap agreements effectively converting the fixed rate on our longterm japanese yen borrowings to a variable shortterm rate based on the japanese yen tibor rate plus markup these swaps are designated as qualified fair value hedges in november 2008 the portion of these swaps related to the 133 billion yen notes refinanced expired swap contracts are generally held to maturity and are intended to create an appropriate balance of fixed and floating rate debt to the extent we have not received cash or otherwise amended or settled any swap agreements any applicable marktomarket adjustment relating to that swap is included as a separate component of debt 

 

the following table summarizes our derivatives outstanding as of december 31 2008 these swaps were all effective under fas 133 

 

 

 

 

method used to test for effectiveness 

 

 34 

 

  

we have established a centralized reporting system to evaluate the effects of changes in interest rates currency exchange rates and other relevant market risks our risk management procedures include the monitoring of interest rate and foreign exchange exposures and hedge positions utilizing statistical analyses of cash flows market value and sensitivity analysis however the use of these techniques to quantify the market risk of such instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of their accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions market exposures are evaluated using a sensitivity model that is intended to measure the potential 10 loss in interest rate and foreign exchange financial instruments assuming adverse market conditions occur historical interest rates and foreign exchange rates are used to estimate the volatility and correlation of future rates 

 

the estimated maximum potential oneday loss in fair value of interest rate or foreign exchange rate instruments calculated using the sensitivity model is not material to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows in 2008 2007 and 2006 the estimated maximum yearly loss in earnings due to interest rate or foreign exchange rate instruments calculated utilizing the sensitivity model is not material to our results of operations in 2008 2007 and 2006 actual results in the future may differ materially from these projected results due to actual developments in the global financial markets 

 

the foreign currency and interest rate swap contracts existing during 2008 and 2007 were entered into for the purpose of seeking to mitigate the risk of certain specific adverse currency and interest rate risks as a result of these financial instruments we reduced financial risk in exchange for foregoing any gain reward that might have occurred if the markets moved favorably in using these contracts management exchanged the risks of the financial markets for counterparty risk counterparty risk arises from the inability of a counterparty to meet its obligations to mitigate counterparty risk we entered into derivative contracts with major leading financial institutions that have credit ratings equal to or better than our credit rating

scientists from various disciplines work in project teams with the perfumers and flavorists to develop fragrance and flavor products with consumer preferred performance characteristics scientific expertise includes natural products research plant science organic chemistry analytical chemistry biochemistry microbiology process engineering food science material science and sensory science analytical and sensory science is applied to understand the complex interactions of the many ingredients in a consumer product in order to optimize the flavor or fragrance performance at all points of use material science technology is applied to create controlled release and delivery systems to enhance flavor and fragrance performance in consumer products an important contribution to the creation of new fragrances and flavors is the discovery and development of new ingredients having improved fragrance or flavor value the ingredients research program discovers molecules found in natural substances and creates new molecules that are subsequently tested for their fragrance or flavor value the new molecules that meet rigorous requirements for commercial development are subsequently transferred to manufacturing operations for production 

creative and technical product development is conducted in 31 fragrance and flavor laboratories in 23 countries we maintain a research and development center at union beach new jersey we spent 199 million in 2007 186 million in 2006 and 180 million in 2005 on our research and development activities or about 9 of our revenues each year we expect these expenditures to remain at approximately 9 of our revenues in 2008 of the amount expended in 2007 on such activities 65 was for fragrances and the balance was for flavors we employed 1132 persons in 2007 and 1065 persons in 2006 in such activities 

our business is not materially dependent upon any patents trademarks or licenses 

distribution 

distribution for both the flavors and fragrances business units is similar in that most of our sales are through our own sales force the flavors business operates from two sales offices in the united states and 38 sales offices in 29 foreign countries while the fragrances business operates from two sales offices in the united states and 36 sales offices in 28 foreign countries sales in additional countries are made through agents and distributors for the year ended december 31 2007 28 of our sales were to customers in north america 37 in europe africa and middle east ‘‘eame’’ 22 in greater asia and 13 in latin america 

during 2007 our 30 largest customers accounted for 57 of our sales sales to one customer accounted for 11 of our sales in 2007 these sales were largely in the fragrances business unit no single customer accounted for more than 10 of our sales in 2006 and 2005 

governmental regulation 

the manufacture and sale of our products are subject to regulation in the united states by the food and drug administration the agriculture department the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms the environmental protection agency the occupational safety and health administration the drug enforcement administration and state authorities foreign subsidiaries are subject to similar regulation in a number of countries in particular the european union in december 2006 adopted legislation requiring extensive chemical registration and testing over the next 11 years compliance with existing governmental requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment has not materially affected our operations earnings or competitive position in 2008 we expect to spend approximately 8 million in capital projects and 20 million in operating expenses and governmental charges for the purpose of complying with such requirements 

raw material purchases 

we purchase roughly 10000 different raw materials from many sources all over the world the principal natural raw materials consist of essential oils extracts and concentrates derived from fruits vegetables flowers woods and other botanicals animal products and raw fruits the principal synthetic raw material purchases consist of organic chemicals we believe that alternate materials or alternate sources of materials are available to enable us to maintain our competitive position in the event of any interruption in the supply of raw materials from present sources 

competition 

we have more than 50 competitors in the united states and world markets two leading competitors have made significant acquisitions in the last two years while no single factor is responsible our competitive position is based principally on the creative skills of our perfumers and flavorists the technological advances resulting from our research and development activities the quality of our customer service the support provided by our marketing and application groups and our understanding of consumers we believe that we are one of the largest companies producing and marketing on an international basis a wide range of fragrance and flavor products for sale to manufacturers of consumer products in particular countries and localities we face competition from numerous companies specializing in certain product lines among which are some companies larger than us and some more important in a particular product line or lines most of our customers do not buy all of their fragrance or flavor products from the same supplier and some customers make their own fragrance or flavor compounds with ingredients supplied by us or others 

employee relations 

at december 31 2007 we employed approximately 5300 persons of whom approximately 1400 were employed in the united states we have never experienced a work stoppage or strike and consider our employee relations to be satisfactory

 item 1a   risk factors tableend competitive factors may negatively impact our sales and marketability 

the market for flavor and fragrance products is fragmented and highly competitive iff competes with many companies and some of our competitors specialize in one or more of our product lines while others sell many of the same product lines in addition some of our competitors may have greater financial and technical resources increased competition by existing or future competitors including aggressive price competition could result in the need for us to reduce prices or increase spending and this could have an impact on sales and profitability 

we are subject to economic and social changes which may impact sales 

demand for consumer products using flavors and fragrances has been stimulated and broadened by changing social habits resulting from factors such as increases in personal income dualearner households teenage population leisure time health concerns and urbanization and by the continued growth in world population changes in any number of external economic factors or changes in social or consumer preferences could adversely impact our results of operations the current macroeconomic environment in the united states and western europe may adversely impact consumer spending on products for which we supply the flavor or fragrance 

results may be negatively impacted by the price quality and availability of raw materials 

raw materials are purchased from many sources from all over the world including essential oils extracts and concentrates derived from fruits vegetables flowers woods and other botanicals animal products raw fruits and organic chemicals disruptions in the supply or quality of ingredients or rising prices for ingredients purchased could adversely impact our results of operations and profitability 

results may be negatively impacted by the inability to implement our business strategy including the achievement of anticipated cost savings profitability or growth targets 

we are committed to those particular business strategies which have been identified as likely to drive profitable future growth and improve operations and customer service if we are unable to successfully and timely implement these strategies it would adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 

results may be negatively affected by the impact of currency fluctuation or devaluation in principal foreign markets and the effectiveness of hedging and risk management strategies 

our operations are conducted in many countries the results of which are reported in the local currency and then translated into us dollars at applicable exchange rates the exchange rates between these currencies and the us dollar have fluctuated and may continue to do so in the future we employ a variety of techniques to reduce the impact of exchange rate fluctuations including foreign currency hedging activities however volatility in currency exchange rates may adversely impact our reported results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

results may be negatively impacted by the outcome of uncertainties related to litigation 

we are involved in a number of legal claims while we believe that related insurance coverage is adequate with respect to such claims we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of such litigation in addition we cannot provide assurance that future events will not require an increase in the amount accrued for any such claims or require accrual for one or more claims that has not been previously accrued 

results and cash flows may be negatively impacted by future pension funding and other postretirement obligations 

we establish assumptions concerning discount rates and actuarial assumptions regarding pension funding and other postretirement benefit obligations based on current market conditions plan participants asset returns interest rates and other factors changes in pension and other postretirement benefits and associated expenses may occur in the future due to changes in demographics and assumptions these changes may adversely impact our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

results may be negatively impacted by the effect of legal and regulatory requirements as well as restrictions imposed on operations by foreign and domestic governmental entities 

the manufacture and sale of our products are subject to regulation in the united states by the food and drug administration the agriculture department the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms the environmental protection agency the occupational safety and health administration the drug enforcement administration and state authorities our foreign operations are subject to similar substantial governmental regulation in a number of countries including extensive new requirements within the european union compliance with existing governmental requirements and future governmental regulations may adversely impact financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

we may face risks associated with events which may affect the world economy 

world events such as terrorist attacks or regional conflicts have and may in the future weaken world economies any resulting weaknesses in these economies may adversely affect our business or the businesses of our customers with a resultant negative impact on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity

in september 2001 the company was named as a defendant in a purported class action brought against it in the circuit court of jasper county missouri on behalf of employees of a plant owned and operated by gilstermary lee corp in jasper missouri ‘‘ benavides case’’ the plaintiffs alleged that they sustained respiratory injuries in the workplace due to the use by gilstermary lee of a bba andor iff flavor we are subject to various claims and legal actions in the ordinary course of our business

sixteen actions based on similar claims of alleged respiratory illness due to workplace exposure to flavor ingredients are currently pending against the company and other flavor suppliers and related companies 

in may 2004 the company and another flavor supplier were named defendants and subsequently a number of third party defendants were added in a lawsuit by 4 former workers and their spouses at a ridgeway illinois factory in an action brought in the circuit court for the second judicial circuit gallatin county illinois  barker case and another concerning 8 other workers and 5 spouses at this same plant was filed in july 2004 and is pending in this same court against the same defendants  batteese case in june 2004 the company and 2 other flavor suppliers were named defendants in a lawsuit by 1 former worker and spouse at a northlake illinois facility in an action brought in the circuit court of cook county illinois nine third party defendants have been added  lopez case in march 2005 the company and 8 other companies were named defendants in a lawsuit by 1 former employee and spouse of bell flavors and fragrances inc in an action brought in the circuit court of cook county illinois  robinson case the company was dismissed from this lawsuit in november 2007 in july 2005 the company and 11 other flavor and chemical suppliers were named defendants in a lawsuit by 1 former worker and spouse of brach’s confections inc in an action brought in the circuit court of cook county illinois brach’s has been added as a third party defendant  campbell case in august 2005 the company and 16 other companies were named defendants in a lawsuit by 3 former employees of the gilstermary lee facility in mcbride missouri in the missouri circuit court 32nd judicial circuit  fults case in august 2006 the company and 3 other flavor and chemical suppliers were named defendants in a lawsuit by 34 current and former employees andor a neighbor of the gilstermary lee facility in jasper missouri in the missouri circuit court of jasper county  arles case and 5 other current and former employees in the same court  bowan case a similar case involving 5 former employees originally plaintiffs in the arles case was filed in the same court in august 2006 and then removed to the us district court western district of missouri southwest division  parker case in november 2006 the company 15 other flavor and chemical suppliers a trade association and a third party defendant company were named defendants in a lawsuit filed in the circuit court of cook county illinois by 1 plaintiff allegedly injured by exposure to butter flavor and other substances at various facilities in which he worked  solis case in january 2007 the company and another flavor supplier were named defendants in a lawsuit filed in hamilton county ohio court of common pleas by approximately 245 current and former employees of two separate marion ohio factories and 92 spouses of such employees  aldrich case in may 2007 the company and 13 other companies were named defendants in a lawsuit filed in circuit court of cook county illinois by 5 former employees of brach’s confections inc in chicago illinois  williams case in june 2007 the company and another flavor supplier were named defendants in a lawsuit filed in hamilton county ohio court of common pleas by 58 current and former employees of a marion ohio facility and 18 spouses of such employees  arnold case in june 2007 the company and 22 other companies were named defendants in a lawsuit in the missouri circuit court 32 nd judicial circuit by 7 former employees of a mcbride missouri facility  geile case in july 2007 the company and another flavor manufacturer were named defendants in a lawsuit filed in hamilton county ohio court of common pleas by 128 current and former workers of two ohio facilities and 52 spouses of such employees  adamson case in july 2007 the company was joined as a defendant in a case filed in june 2005 against 7 companies and a trade association in the 8 th judicial district court of montana by the widow of the former owneroperator of a popcorn business in montana  yatsko case 

in october 2007 the company and 23 other companies were named defendants in a lawsuit in the missouri circuit court 32 nd judicial circuit by the widow and daughter of a former worker at a mcbride missouri facility  wibbenmeyer case 

the company believes that all iff and bba flavors at issue in these matters meet the requirements of the us food and drug administration and are safe for handling and use by workers in food manufacturing plants when used according to specified safety procedures these procedures are detailed in instructions that iff and bba provided to all their customers for the safe handling and use of their flavors it is the responsibility of iff’s customers to ensure that these instructions which include the use of appropriate engineering controls such as adequate ventilation prior handling procedures and respiratory protection for workers are followed in the workplace 

at each balance sheet date or more frequently as conditions warrant we review the status of each pending claim as well as our insurance coverage for such claims with due consideration given to potentially applicable deductibles retentions and reservation of rights under its insurance policies with respect to all these matters while the ultimate outcome of any litigation cannot be predicted management believes that adequate provision has been made with respect to all known claims based on information presently available and in light of the merits of its defenses and the availability of insurance we do not expect the outcome of the above cases singly or in the aggregate to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operation or liquidity there can be no assurance that future events will not require us to increase the amount we have accrued for any matter or accrue for a matter that has not been previously accrued see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

over the past 20 years various federal and state authorities and private parties have claimed that we are a potentially responsible party ‘‘prp’’ as a generator of waste materials for alleged pollution at a number of waste sites operated by third parties located principally in new jersey and have sought to recover costs incurred and to be incurred to clean up the sites 

we have been identified as a prp at nine facilities operated by third parties at which investigation andor remediation activities may be ongoing we analyze our liability on a regular basis we accrue for environmental liabilities when they are probable and estimable at december 31 2007 we estimated our share of the total future cost for these sites to be less than 5 million 

while joint and several liability is authorized under federal and state environmental laws we believe the amounts we have paid and anticipate paying in the future for cleanup costs and damages at all sites are not and will not be material to our financial condition results of operations or liquidity this conclusion is based upon among other things the involvement of other prps at most sites the status of proceedings including various settlement agreements and consent decrees the extended time period over which payments will likely be made and an agreement reached in july 1994 with three of our liability insurers pursuant to which defense costs and indemnity amounts payable by us in respect of the sites will be shared by the insurers up to an agreed amount

organization of information 

management’s discussion and analysis provides a narrative on our operating performance financial condition and liquidity and should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements it includes the following sections 

            executive overview 

we are a leading creator and manufacturer of flavor and fragrance compounds used to impart or improve the flavor or fragrance in a wide variety of consumer products the precise size of the global market for flavors and fragrances is difficult to determine because the industry is highly fragmented both geographically and along product lines there are a limited number of publicly traded companies in the industry certain customers maintain inhouse capabilities fulfilling a portion of their flavor or fragrance needs and the quality and depth of market information in developing regions of the world is limited analysts generally estimate the global market to be 11  12 billion of which iff represents 1719 the largest competitor in the industry has approximately a 25 market share currently the largest companies in the industry combined represent approximately 65 of the global market 

effective january 1 2007 iff reorganized into two units that reflect our flavor and fragrance businesses approximately 44 of our 2007 net sales were flavor compounds flavor compounds are sold to the food and beverage industries for use in consumer products such as prepared foods beverages dairy food and confectionery products the remaining 56 of sales representing the fragrances business unit were in three fragrance categories functional fragrances including fragrance compounds for personal care eg soaps and household products eg detergents and cleaning agents fine fragrance and beauty care including perfumes colognes and toiletries and ingredients consisting of synthetic ingredients that can be combined with other materials to create unique functional and fine fragrance compounds major fragrance customers include the cosmetics industry including perfume and toiletries manufacturers and the household products industry including manufacturers of soaps detergents fabric care household cleaners and air fresheners approximately 55 of our ingredient production is consumed internally the balance is sold to third party customers 

changing social habits resulting from such factors as changes in disposable income leisure time health concerns urbanization and population growth stimulate demand for consumer products utilizing flavors and fragrances these developments expand the market for products with finer fragrance quality as well as the 

market for colognes and toiletries such developments also stimulate demand for convenience foods soft drinks and lowfat and organic food products that must conform to expected tastes these developments necessitate the creation and development of flavors and fragrances and ingredients that are compatible with newly introduced materials and methods of application used in consumer products 

flavors and fragrances are generally 

    the flavor and fragrance industry is impacted by macroeconomic factors in all product categories and geographic regions such factors include the impact of currency on the price of raw materials and operating costs as well as on translation of reported results in addition pricing pressure placed on our customers by large and powerful retailers and distributors is inevitably passed along to us and our competitors leadership in innovation and creativity mitigates the impact of pricing pressure success and growth in the industry is dependent upon creativity and innovation in meeting the many and varied needs of the customers’ products in a costefficient and effective manner and with a consistently high level of timely service and delivery 

we produce more than 33000 unique compounds of which approximately 60 are flavors and 40 fragrances we continually create new compounds to meet the changing characteristics and needs of our customers’ end products no single compound represents more than 15 of net sales development of fragrances and flavors is a complex artistic and technical process calling upon the combined knowledge and talents of creative perfumers and flavorists and application and research chemists an important element of creation is the development of new ingredients we bear essentially all costs incurred in connection with the creation and development of new flavors and fragrances and such formulae are generally protected under trade secrecy we are not materially dependent on any patents trademarks or licenses 

our strategic direction is defined by the following 

  our plan to achieve this strategy is to 

     as implementation of the strategy progresses setting strategic initiatives requires regular establishment and reassessment of priorities and necessitates choices in order to provide the best opportunity for continuous improvement in shareholder value 

sales commentary 

a breakdown of sales by principal product category is depicted in the graph below 

2007 sales by category 

our five largest customers comprise 32 of consolidated sales and our top 30 customers 57 these percentages have remained fairly constant for several years although sales to larger customers are trending higher we have one customer that accounts for 11 of our sales a key factor for commercial success is inclusion on the strategic customers’ core supplier lists opening opportunities to win new business we are on the core supplier lists of a majority of our strategic customers 

net sales by business unit for 2007 2006 and 2005 were as follows 

 

2007 sales by destination 

we currently manage our operations by business unit but consider destination sales a supplemental performance measure although reported sales and earnings are affected by the weakening or strengthening of the us dollar this has not had a longterm effect on the underlying strength of our business

  2007 in comparison to 2006 

sales totaled 2277 million up 9 from 2006 flavor and fragrance sales increased 12 and 6 respectively 2007 sales benefited from the generally weaker us dollar and at comparable exchange rates would have increased 5 over the prior year 

flavors business unit 

flavors delivered strong sales performance across all regions – most notably in latin america greater asia and europe – and in virtually all categories particularly beverages and savory

consolidated operating results 

the percentage relationship of cost of goods sold and other operating expenses to reported sales is detailed as follows 

 

cost of goods sold includes the cost of materials and manufacturing expenses raw materials generally constitute 70 of the total research and development expenses are for the development of new and improved products technical product support compliance with governmental regulations and help in maintaining relationships with customers who are often dependent on technological advances selling and administrative expenses support our sales and operating levels 

2007 in comparison to 2006 

cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales was 582 compared with 578 in 2006 this increase was mainly as a result of product mix notably higher sales of fragrance ingredients and flavor compounds lower selling prices for fragrance ingredients some impact of higher material costs and under absorption of manufacturing costs at a new fragrance ingredient facility in china which scaled up production in 2007 also contributed to the increase the average cost of raw materials increased 23 over the prior year 

research and development expense as a percentage of sales was 87 comparable to the prior year levels 

selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 165 in the current period compared to 168 in the prior year period reflecting good cost control and the benefit of headcount reductions that occurred in the first half of 2006 selling and administrative expenses in 2007 include 4 million of business transformation costs to enable us to better leverage our global sap software platform such costs are not expected to recur in 2008 the 2006 results also included the benefit of a 3 million insurance recovery related to a 2005 product contamination matter excluding the insurance recovery 2006 selling and administrative expenses would have been 169 of sales for the year 

interest expense 

in 2007 interest expense totaled 42 million increasing 63 compared to 2006 due to higher borrowings incurred in connection with share repurchase activities see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the share repurchase activities average cost of debt was 45 for 2007 compared to 33 in 2006 

other income expense net 

other income expense net in 2007 increased 1 million over the prior year mainly due to favorable exchange results and higher interest income as a result of higher interest rates other income included 11 million and 15 million in 2007 and 2006 respectively primarily related to gains on asset sales 

income taxes 

the effective tax rate was 248 in 2007 as compared to a rate of 277 in the prior year both the 2007 and 2006 rates benefited from favorable tax rulings with respect to prior years excluding the benefit of these rulings from both years the 2007 effective tax rate would have been 278 compared to a rate of 288 for 2006 the lower effective tax rate for the current year was largely the result of a greater percentage of consolidated pretax earnings in lower tax jurisdictions 

operating results by business unit 

we evaluate the performance of business units based on operating profit before gainslosses on the disposition of assets interest expense other income expense net and income taxes see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for the reconciliation to income before taxes 

flavors business unit 

in 2007 flavors operating profit of 187 million or 186 as a percentage of sales increased as compared to 153 million or 171 in 2006 the amount reported in 2006 benefited from a 3 million insurance recovery related to a 2005 product contamination matter excluding the insurance recovery from the prior year comparative flavors profitability would have increased an additional 30 basis points over 2006 this profitability improvement was primarily driven by margin improvement enabled by strong sales growth favorable product mix increased absorption of manufacturing expenses and good cost control 

fragrances business unit 

in 2007 fragrance operating profit of 210 million or 165 as a percentage of sales declined from the 212 million or 177 reported in 2006 profitability was negatively impacted by lower selling prices of fragrance ingredients higher material costs and underabsorption of manufacturing costs related to scaling up the china facility in 2007 

global expenses 

global expenses represent corporate and headquartersrelated expenses which include legal finance human resources and other administrative expenses that are not allocated to an individual business unit as well as gains on asset sales and a pension curtailment charge in 2007 global expenses increased 9 million to 27 million from 18 million incurred in 2006 in 2007 global expenses included approximately 6 million of curtailment loss as a result of changes to the us defined benefit pension plan and approximately 11 million related to gains on asset sales the 2006 expenses included approximately 15 million of other income primarily related to gains on asset sales 

2006 in comparison to 2005 

cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales decreased 80 basis points compared with 2005 mainly as a result of the improved sales performance leading to better absorption of manufacturing expenses and favorable product mix we also benefited from the elimination of 69 manufacturing positions in 2005 mainly in north america and europe which resulted in savings of 4 million the average cost of raw materials increased 23 over the prior year 

research and development expenses were 89 of sales inline with our objective of spending approximately 9 of revenues on research and development annually 

selling and administrative expenses were 168 of sales compared to 170 in 2005 the 2005 results included 8 million relating to a product contamination matter 2006 results reflect the benefit of a 3 million insurance recovery related to this contamination matter we benefited from the elimination of 129 positions mainly in north america and europe which resulted in savings of 8 million the 2006 period also included 31 million in incentive compensation expense driven by improved sales and operating performance the 2005 results included 5 million of such expense 

interest expense 

interest expense totaled 26 million and 24 million in 2006 and 2005 respectively the average interest rate remained at 33 for both years the interest rate for each period reflects our debt and interest rate management plans additional details are contained in note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

other income expense net 

other income expense net was 10 million of income in 2006 and 3 million of expense in 2005 in 2006 income resulted from gains on asset sales of 18 million partially offset by higher exchange losses and other nonoperating expenses in 2005 income resulted primarily from exchange gains and higher levels of interest income earned on higher cash balances exchange losses or gains were 7 million and 3 million in 2006 and 2005 respectively the exchange losses in 2006 were mainly the result of having us dollar positions in europe and latin america which resulted in exchange losses upon the weakening of the us dollar in comparison to the euro and other currencies 

income taxes 

the effective tax rate for 2006 was 277 and 216 for 2005 our effective tax rate fluctuates as a result of earnings in the countries in which we operate the 2005 rate was significantly reduced as a result of a tax benefit associated with the american jobs creation act ‘‘ajca’’ which provided for a special onetime tax deduction of 85 of dividends received on eligible repatriated foreign earnings tax expense in 2005 reflects a benefit of 25 million relating to our repatriation of 242 million of dividends under the provisions of ajca excluding the benefit of ajca the effective tax rate for 2005 would have been 316

flavors operating profit of 153 million or 171 as a percentage of sales increased as compared to 108 million or 126 in 2005 the 2005 results included 8 million relating to a product contamination matter 2006 results reflect the benefit of a 3 million insurance recovery related to this contamination matter the 2005 results also included approximately 6 million of restructuring charges this profitability improvement was partially the result of increased sales volume leading to better absorption of manufacturing expenses and favorable product mix selling and administrative expenses declined substantially from 2005 largely as a result of a reduction in headcount related to the restructuring more fully described below while research and development expenses remained constant with 2005 offsetting the benefit of the headcount reduction was approximately a 6 million increase in incentive compensation as a result of improved operating results 

fragrances business unit 

fragrance operating profit of 212 million increased from the 187 million reported in 2005 with a corresponding increase in operating profit as a percentage of sales to 177 in 2006 from 164 in 2005 the 2005 results included approximately 10 million in restructuring charges compared to 3 million in 2006 higher sales volume led to increased absorption of manufacturing expenses which was partially offset by higher raw material costs resulting in improved profitability spending on research and development remained fairly constant between the two years while selling and administrative expenses declined as a result of the headcount reduction related to the restructuring discussed below offsetting the benefit of the headcount reduction was approximately a 10 million increase in incentive compensation as a result of improved operating results 

global expenses 

the global expense caption represents corporate and headquartersrelated expenses which include legal finance human resources and other administrative expenses that are not allocated to individual business unit as well as gains on asset sales global expenses increased by 9 million in 2006 over 2005 primarily due to approximately 11 million of additional incentive compensation in 2006 2005 global expenses included 7 million in restructuring charges 

goodwill and intangible assets 

at december 31 2007 and 2006 goodwill and other intangible assets net of accumulated amortization totaled 733 million and 746 million respectively we completed our annual assessments in 2007 and 2006 concluding there was no impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets additional details are contained in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements 

we perform a goodwill impairment test on at least an annual basis or more frequently in certain circumstances by assessing the fair value of our reporting units based upon both discounted cash flow and comparison of multiples of comparable companies we deem goodwill to be impaired if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value we completed our annual assessments in 2007 and 2006 concluding there was no impairment of goodwill 

other intangible assets include patents trademarks and other intellectual property valued at acquisition primarily through independent appraisals which are amortized on a straightline basis over periods ranging from 7 to 20 years we review our other intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in business conditions indicate that their full carrying value may not be recovered 

restructuring and other charges 

with respect to the restructuring and other charges 

   in 2005 we undertook to eliminate 300 positions in manufacturing selling research and administration functions principally in our european and north american operating regions the majority of affected positions involve employee separation while the balance related to open positions that are not expected to be filled we recorded pretax restructuring charges relating primarily to employee separation expenses of 23 million in 2005 and 3 million in 2006 this plan is essentially complete annual savings from these actions approximated 1618 million 

positions eliminated including those not replaced by the 2005 program and charges by business segment in 2006 and 2005 are detailed in the table below there were no such actions undertaken in 2007 nor charges incurred 

restructuring charges 

 

movements in related accruals in each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2007 were 

 

the remaining employeerelated liabilities are expected to be utilized in 2008 as obligations are satisfied 

income taxes 

in september 2006 the fasb issued interpretation no 48 ‘‘fin 48’’ accounting for uncertainty in income taxes which clarifies the application of fas 109 by prescribing the minimum threshold a tax position must meet before being recognized in the financial statements the adoption of fin 48 did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

retirement benefits 

in 2007 we amended our us salaried qualified and nonqualified pension plans under which accrual of future benefits was suspended for all participants that did not meet the rule of 70 age plus years of service equal at least 70 at december 31 2007 as a result of this suspension we recorded a curtailment loss of 59 million to recognize a portion of the unrecognized prior service costs associated with years of service no longer expected to be rendered and credited as service under the plans we also introduced an enhanced defined contribution plan for those employees affected by the pension curtailment that will become effective january 1 2008 as a result of these events we expect to realize a net annual cost savings of approximately 4 million beginning in 2008 

financial condition 

cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaled 152 million at december 31 2007 compared to 115 million and 273 million at december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively working capital totaled 652 million at yearend 2007 compared to 633 million and 11 million at december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively the increase in working capital was primarily related to increases in accounts receivable and inventories partially offset by an increase of 137 million in current debt largely as a result of borrowings that mature in november 2008 the 2005 working capital balance resulted from the classification of certain debt as current due to its maturity in may 2006 such debt was refinanced during 2006 gross additions to property plant and equipment were 66 million 58 million and 93 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively and are expected to approximate 90 million in 2008 

our financial condition continues to be of high quality as evidenced by substantial cash flow from operations and ready access to capital markets at competitive rates operating cash flow provides the primary source of funds for operating and capital needs as well as dividends paid to shareholders and share repurchase activities we anticipate that cash flows from operations and availability under our existing credit facilities are expected to be sufficient to fund our currently anticipated capital spending and other currently expected cash requirements for at least the next eighteen months 

operating cash flow in 2007 was 314 million compared to 282 million and 177 million in 2006 and 2005 respectively operating cash flows in 2006 were revised from the 263 million previously reported amounts 

previously reported had been reduced by the purchase of investments of 18 million and deferred financing costs totaling 1 million that were determined to be more appropriately classified as investing and financing activities respectively 2005 operating cash flows were unaffected by the revision the increase in operating cash flow in 2007 compared to the prior year was primarily the result of higher net income net earnings adjusted for noncash items primarily depreciation amortization and equitybased compensation was the primary source of operating cash flows 

operating cash flow increased in 2006 as compared to 2005 as a result of improved sales and operating results net earnings adjusted for noncash items primarily depreciation amortization and equitybased compensation was the primary source of operating cash flows improvements in inventory and current payables were sufficient to offset an increase in receivables the increases in receivables and payables supported the business growth achieved in 2006 

net investing activities in 2007 utilized 51 million compared to 48 million and 91 million in 2006 and 2005 respectively the 2006 cash used in investing activities increased 18 million as a result of revising the cash flow for certain investing and financing activities as discussed above investing cash outflows increased primarily due to purchase of investments of 13 million partially offset by proceeds from investment sales of 10 million 

in 2007 and 2006 we realized cash proceeds from the sale of assets in both years the proceeds related to the sale of land and buildings to the extent such assets had been written down in connection with previous restructuring activities any gain or loss on disposition was accounted for as part of the restructuring activities all transactions were with third party investors and we retained no ownership interest in any of the disposed assets 

compliance with existing governmental requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment has not materially affected our operations earnings or competitive position in 2007 we spent 3 million on capital projects and 18 million in operating expenses and governmental charges for the purpose of complying with such regulations expenditures for these purposes will continue for the foreseeable future in addition we are party to a number of proceedings brought under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act or similar state statutes it is expected that the impact of any judgments in or voluntary settlements of such proceedings will not be material to our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

the dividend paid per share in 2007 2006 and 2005 was 86 74 and 72 respectively in january april and july 2007 we paid a quarterly cash dividend of 21 per share to shareholders in july 2007 we announced a 10 increase in our quarterly dividend rate to 23 per share effective with the dividend payable in october 2007 we paid dividends totaling 77 million 67 million and 68 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 our current intention is to pay dividends approximating 30 − 35 of yearly earnings however the payment of dividends is determined by the board at its discretion based on various factors and no assurance can be provided as to future dividends 

we supplement shortterm liquidity with access to capital markets mainly through the issuance of commercial paper and with bank credit facilities in 2005 we including certain subsidiaries entered into a revolving credit agreement the ‘‘facility’’ with certain banks the facility provides for a fiveyear us 350 million ‘‘tranche a’’ and euro 400 million ‘‘tranche b’’ multicurrency revolving credit facility tranche a is available to iff for commercial paper backstop and general corporate purposes tranche b is available to both iff and the european subsidiaries for general corporate purposes borrowings under the facility bear interest at an annual rate of libor london inter bank offer rate or in relation to any eurodenominated loans euribor european inter bank offer rate plus a margin currently 20 basis points linked to our credit rating we pay a commitment fee on the aggregate unused commitments and a utilization fee based on amounts outstanding under the facility such fees are not material as permitted by the facility in 2007 the termination dates were extended by one year until november 23 2012 the facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants customary in a facility of this type including a covenant requiring us to maintain at the end of each fiscal quarter a ratio of net debt for borrowed money to ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization in respect of the previous 12month period of not more than 325 to 1 we have complied with this covenant at all times 

in addition including our subsidiaries we had unused lines of credit totaling 846 million at december 31 2007 compared to 701 million at december 31 2006 

at december 31 2007 we had 1213 million of debt outstanding on september 27 2007 we issued 500 million of senior unsecured notes ‘‘senior notes − 2007’’ in four series under the note purchase agreement ‘‘npa’’ i 250 million in aggregate principal amount of 625 series a senior notes due september 27 2017 ii 100 million in aggregate principal amount of 635 series b notes due september 27 2019 iii 50 million in aggregate principal amount of 650 series c notes due september 27 2022 and iv 100 million in aggregate principal amount of 679 series d notes due september 27 2027 proceeds were used primarily to fund repurchases of iff stock discussed below under the npa we may at any time with notice prepay all or a portion equal to or greater than 10 of the notes for an amount equal to the principal accrued interest and a ‘‘makewhole’’ prepayment premium as calculated under the npa we may also prepay the senior notes − 2007 solely for the principal and accrued interest thereon in connection with certain asset sales we will be required to make an offer to prepay the senior notes − 2007 following a change in control as defined in the npa for an amount equal to the principal and accrued interest but without a ‘‘makewhole’’ or other premium 

in contemplation of this debt issuance we entered into interest rate hedge contracts with a notional amount of 400 million to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates the contracts were designated as hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in the longterm benchmark interest rates and the credit spread we recorded a 16 million gain on the settlement of these interest rate hedge contracts which coincided with the issuance of the longterm fixedrate debt for additional information regarding this transaction see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

pursuant to the npa we are required to maintain a consolidated net debt to consolidated ebitda ratio of 351 as calculated under the npa provided that such ratio may exceed 351 but not 41 upon the payment of certain additional interest and provided further that such ratio does not exceed 351 for more than eight consecutive quarters in addition we are required not to permit the aggregate amount of our subsidiaries’ debt to exceed 20 of our consolidated total assets as calculated under the npa with certain exceptions we including our subsidiaries will not incur any liens subject to certain permitted categories of liens and a general lien allowance of 120 million we also made certain affirmative and negative covenants relating to the operation of our business material events such as asset sales and mergers and the pari passu ranking of the senior notes2007 

as a result of the additional debt moody’s and standard  poor’s ‘‘sp’’ affirmed their shortterm credit rating for iff at p2 and a2 respectively and moody’s and sp adjusted their longterm rating to baa1 and bbb respectively with a stable outlook 

during the first six months of 2007 under a share repurchase program of 300 million authorized in october 2006 the ‘‘october 2006 plan’’ we repurchased approximately 16 million shares at a cost of 81 million at june 30 2007 we had approximately 125 million remaining under the october 2006 plan in july 2007 the october 2006 plan was terminated and superseded by a new program authorized by our board to repurchase up to 15 or 750 million worth of our outstanding common stock whichever is less the ‘‘july 2007 plan’’ 

in september 2007 under the july 2007 plan we entered into two agreements to purchase shares of our common stock under a 450 million accelerated share repurchase ‘‘asr’’ program on september 28 2007 we paid 450 million in exchange for an initial delivery of 76 million shares under the asr representing 90 of the shares that could have been purchased based on the prior closing price of our stock the remaining 10 or 45 million not used in the initial settlement will be included in the determination of the cost of the shares purchased on completion of the asr and was reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as a reduction to capital in excess of par value 

on completion of the asr which is expected to be by the end of the second quarter of 2008 we may receive additional shares or may be required to pay cash or additional shares at our option based on the volumeweighted average price ‘‘vwap’’ of the common stock during the agreement term for additional information regarding these transactions see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements proceeds from the 500 million senior notes — 2007 described above funded the payment 

in the year ended december 31 2007 we purchased 102 million shares at a cost of 532 million in the year ended december 31 2006 we purchased 69 million shares at a cost of 271 million 

at december 31 2007 we have contractual payment obligations due within the time periods as specified in the following table 

 

     critical accounting policies and use of estimates 

our accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements as disclosed in note 1 the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles ‘‘gaap’’ requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and accompanying disclosures these estimates are based on management’s best judgment of current events and actions that we may undertake in the future actual results may ultimately differ from estimates 

those areas requiring the greatest degree of management judgment or deemed most critical to our financial reporting involve 

the periodic assessment of potential impairment of intangible assets acquired in business combinations we currently have net intangible assets including goodwill of 733 million goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually in assessing goodwill management uses the most current actual and forecasted operating data available and current market based assumptions a twostep approach is employed the first step involves estimating the value of reporting units based on the present value of estimated future cash flows the second step if necessary is to measure the value of the impairment loss if any management’s most subjective assumptions relate to the estimatedprojected sales and operating growth values employed in the forecast 

the analysis and evaluation of income taxes we account for taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 109 ‘‘accounting for income taxes’’ ‘‘fas 109’’ under fas 109 deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities based on tax laws as currently enacted the provision for income taxes is based on statutory income taxes rates and planning opportunities available in the various tax jurisdictions where we operate significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and tax positions we may be challenged upon review by the applicable taxing authority and positions taken by us may not be sustained we regularly update these accruals in light of changing facts and circumstances 

in 2007 we adopted sfas no 48 ‘‘accounting for uncertainty in income taxes’’ an interpretation of fas 109 ‘‘fin 48’’ as a result of adopting fin 48 we recognized a 1 million increase in other liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and a corresponding cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings also as prescribed by fin 48 certain tax related amounts in the consolidated balance sheet are classified differently than in prior periods amounts receivable from various tax jurisdictions are now included in other current assets and tax reserves previously classified as accrued taxes on income are now included in other liabilities 

the evaluation of potential legal and environmental liabilities where changing circumstances rules and regulations require regular reassessment of related practices and anticipated costs we are subject to certain legal claims regarding products and other matters as well as environmentalrelated matters significant management judgment is involved in determining when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the extent to which it can be reasonably estimated 

we regularly assesses potential liabilities with respect to all legal claims based on the most recent available information in consultation with outside counsel handling the defense of such matters to the extent a liability is deemed to have been incurred and can be reasonably estimated we recognize a corresponding liability if the reasonably estimated liability is a range we recognize that amount considered most likely or in the absence of such a determination the minimum reasonably expected liability to the extent such claims are covered by various insurance policies we separately evaluate the likelihood of recovery and account for any related insurance receivable management judgments involve determination as to whether a liability has been incurred the reasonably estimated amount of that liability and any potential insurance recovery 

we regularly evaluate potential environmental exposure in terms of total estimated cost and the viability of other potentially responsible parties ‘‘prp’s’’ associated with our exposure recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress and additional information becomes available critical management assumptions relate to expected total costs to remediate and the financial viability of prp’s to share such costs 

determination of the various assumptions employed in the valuation of pension and retiree health care expense and associated obligations amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined from actuarial valuations inherent in such valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets discount rates at which the liabilities could be settled rates of increase in future compensation levels mortality rates and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore affect expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods 

with respect to the us plans the expected return on plan assets was determined based on an asset allocation model using the current benchmark allocation real rates of return by asset class and an anticipated inflation rate the benchmark asset allocation was 10 − 20 in cash and fixed income investments expected to yield 10 10 − 20 employed in corporate and government bonds expected to yield 21 and 65 − 75 in equity investments with a longterm expected yield of 85 − 93 the inflation rate assumed in the model was 25 the plan has achieved a compounded annual rate of return of 96 over the previous 20 years the expected annual rate of return for the nonus plans employs a similar set of criteria adapted for local investments inflation rates and in certain cases specific government requirements the discount rate used for determining future pension obligations for each individual plan is based on a review of longterm bonds that receive a high rating from a recognized rating agency additionally for the us plans the discount rate was based on the internal rate of return for a portfolio of moody’s aa3rated high quality bonds with maturities that are consistent with the projected future benefit payment obligations of the plan the rate of compensation increase for all plans and the medical cost trend rate for the applicable us plans are based on plan experience 

management establishes the assumptions concerning discount rates and actuarial assumptions based on current market conditions including asset returns and other factors applicable under the circumstances changes in pension and other postemployment benefits and associated expenses may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions the impact that a 25 decrease in the discount rate or a 1 change in the medical cost trend rate would have on our pension and other postemployment benefit expense as applicable is discussed in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements 

the ongoing assessment of the valuation of inventory given the large number of natural ingredients employed the quality of which may be diminished over time we maintain between 40 and 55 of our inventory as raw materials providing the greatest degree of flexibility in manufacture and use materials are evaluated based on shelf life known uses and anticipated demand based on forecasted customer order activity and changes in productsales mix management policy provides for an ongoing assessment of inventory with adjustments recorded when an item is deemed to be slow moving or obsolete 

determination of various assumptions employed in the calculation of equity compensation expense amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to equity compensation are determined based on the number of awards and type of award as well as specific assumptions regarding expected life stock price volatility risk free interest rate termination rates exercise multiple and the dividend yield these assumptions are employed in the binomial model used to value certain awards management establishes the assumptions based on current market conditions and historical trends related to the equity awards 

we changed our valuation model used for estimating the fair value of options granted after january 1 2006 from a blackscholes optionpricing model to a binomial latticepricing model this change was made in order to provide a better estimate of fair value since the binomial model is a more flexible method for valuing employee stock options than the blackscholes model the flexibility of the simulated binomial model stems from the ability incorporate inputs that change over time such as volatility and interest rates and to allow for actual exercise behavior of option holders we are using an average of implied and historical volatility while the expected term assumption was determined based on historical patterns 

developing the assumptions used in the binomial model requires significant judgment on our part and generally may involve analyzing available historical data considering whether historical data is relevant to predicting future behavior making appropriate adjustments to historical data for future expectations supplementing or replacing companyspecific historical data with data from other supportable sources and appropriately weighting each of the inputs these assumptions are evaluated at each grant date if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating sharebased compensation expense in future periods or if we decide to use a different valuation model the future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect operating income net income and net income per share 

we believe that we have considered relevant circumstances that we may be currently subject to and the financial statements accurately reflect our best estimate of the results of our operations financial condition and cash flows for the years presented we have discussed the decision process and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 

new accounting standards 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 ‘‘fas 157’’ ‘‘fair value measurements’’ this statement defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements fas 157 is effective for years beginning after december 15 2007 we are currently assessing the impact of this interpretation but we do not believe its adoption will have a material impact on our results or financial condition 

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159 ‘‘the fair value option for financial assets and liabilities — including an amendment of fasb no 115’’ ‘‘fas 159’’ this standard allows companies to elect at specific election dates to measure eligible financial assets and liabilities at fair value that are not otherwise required to be measured at fair value if a company elects the fair value option subsequent changes in that item’s fair value must be recognized in current earnings fas 159 is effective for years beginning after november 15 2007 we are currently evaluating the impact of this standard 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141 revised 2007 ‘‘business combinations’’ ‘‘fas 141r’’ in fas 141r the fasb retained the fundamental requirements of statement no 141 to account for all business combinations using the acquisition method formerly the purchase method and for an acquiring entity to be identified in all business combinations however the new standard requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction establishes the acquisitiondate fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed and requires the acquirer to disclose to investors and other users all of the information they need to evaluate and understand the nature and financial effect of the business combination fas 141r is effective for annual periods beginning on or after december 15 2008 we have not yet determined the impact if any that fas 141r will have on our results of operations or financial position 

nongaap financial measures 

the discussion of our historical results include and where indicated exclude the benefit of a 2006 insurance recovery relating to a product contamination issue certain favorable tax rulings with respect to prior years and the 

impact of repatriation of certain dividends from foreign subsidiaries under the ajca as well as the effects of exchange rate fluctuations such information is supplemental to information presented in accordance with gaap and is not intended to represent a presentation in accordance with gaap in discussing our historical and expected future results and financial condition we believe it is meaningful for investors to be made aware of and to be assisted in a better understanding of on a periodtoperiod comparative basis such matters as the 2006 insurance recovery relating to a product contamination issue repatriation of certain dividends from foreign subsidiaries under ajca certain favorable tax rulings with respect to prior years as well as the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on operating results and financial condition we believe such additional nongaap information provides investors with an overall perspective of the periodtoperiod performance of our core business in addition management internally reviews each of these nongaap measures to evaluate performance on a comparative periodtoperiod basis in terms of absolute performance trends and expected future performance with respect to its core continuing business a material limitation of these nongaap measures is that such measures do not reflect actual gaap amounts an insurance recovery includes actual cash inflows and the benefit from favorable tax rulings and ajca reflect actual accounting and cash benefits realized and we compensate for such limitations by presenting the accompanying reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measure these nongaap measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend we operate on a global basis and are exposed to currency fluctuation related to the manufacture and sale of our products in currencies other than the us dollar the major foreign currencies involve the markets in the european union great britain mexico brazil china indonesia australia and japan although all regions are subject to foreign currency fluctuations versus the us dollar we actively monitor our foreign currency exposures in all major markets in which we operate and employ a variety of techniques to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations including foreign currency hedging activities we enter into foreign currency forward contracts with the objective of reducing exposure to cash flow volatility associated with foreign currency receivables and payables and with anticipated purchases of certain raw materials used in operations these contracts the counterparties to which are major international financial institutions generally involve the exchange of one 

currency for a second currency at a future date and have maturities not exceeding six months the notional amount and maturity dates of such contracts match those of the underlying transactions the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recorded in earnings at the same time as the transaction being hedged is recorded in earnings in february 2003 we executed a 10year yen − us dollar currency swap related to the monthly sale and purchase of products between the us and japan which is designated as a cash flow hedge the annual notional value of this swap is approximately 5 million the associated asset or liability on the open hedge instrument is recorded in current assets or current liabilities as applicable gains and losses related to this swap are recorded currently and the marktomarket adjustment related to the value of the swap is reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income ‘‘aoci’’ 

in addition to the foreign exchange forward contracts noted above we use nonus dollar borrowings and foreign exchange swap agreements to hedge the foreign currency exposures of our net investment in certain foreign affiliates primarily in the european union these foreign exchange swap agreements are designated as hedges of net investments in september 2007 and january 2006 we entered into a 250 million and a 300 million cross currency interest rate swap respectively to hedge a portion of our consolidated eur net investment the derivative was structured as a swap of floating usd libor to floating euribor with both floating interest rates reset and paid semiannually because the derivative is structured as a floating to floating swap the only value other than that derived from changes in the spot foreign exchange fx rate are interest rate accruals which are reset semiannually these accruals are netted and booked in current earnings marktomarket changes due to differences in the underlying fx rate are recorded in aoci and provide an offset to the cumulative translation adjustment of the underlying euro net investments being hedged effectiveness is assessed quarterly at maturity or if the swaps are terminated early any gain or loss will not be recorded to earnings but will be recorded to aoci until the eur net investment is divested 

we use derivative instruments as part of our interest rate risk management strategy the derivative instruments used are comprised principally of fixed to floating rate interest rate swaps in september 2007 we entered into a 250 million interest rate swap agreement effectively converting the fixed rate on our longterm us dollar borrowings to a variable shortterm rate based on usd libor rate plus markup in addition in 2005 we entered into certain interest rate swap agreements effectively converting the fixed rate on our longterm japanese yen borrowings to a variable shortterm rate based on the japanese yen libor rate plus markup these swaps are designated as qualified fair value hedges swap contracts are generally held to maturity and are intended to create an appropriate balance of fixed and floating rate debt to the extent we have not received cash or otherwise amended or settled any swap agreements any applicable marktomarket adjustment relating to that swap is included as a separate component of debt 

the following table summarizes our derivatives outstanding as of december 31 2007 these swaps were all effective under fas 133 

 

method used to test for effectiveness 

   32

  we have established a centralized reporting system to evaluate the effects of changes in interest rates currency exchange rates and other relevant market risks our risk management procedures include the monitoring of interest rate and foreign exchange exposures and hedge positions utilizing statistical analyses of cash flows market value and sensitivity analysis however the use of these techniques to quantify the market risk of such instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of their accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions market exposures are evaluated using a sensitivity model that is intended to measure the potential 10 loss in interest rate and foreign exchange financial instruments assuming adverse market conditions occur historical interest rates and foreign exchange rates are used to estimate the volatility and correlation of future rates 

the estimated maximum potential oneday loss in fair value of interest rate or foreign exchange rate instruments calculated using the sensitivity model is not material to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows in 2007 2006 and 2005 the estimated maximum yearly loss in earnings due to interest rate or foreign exchange rate instruments calculated utilizing the sensitivity model is not material to our results of operations in 2007 2006 and 2005 actual results in the future may differ materially from these projected results due to actual developments in the global financial markets 

the foreign currency and interest rate swap contracts existing during 2007 and 2006 were entered into for the purpose of seeking to mitigate the risk of certain specific adverse currency and interest rate risks as a result of these financial instruments we reduced financial risk in exchange for foregoing any gain reward that might have occurred if the markets moved favorably in using these contracts management exchanged the risks of the financial markets for counterparty risk counterparty risk arises from the inability of a counterparty to meet its obligations to mitigate counterparty risk we entered into derivative contracts with major leading financial institutions that have credit ratings equal to or better than our credit rating

over the past 20 years various federal and state authorities and private parties have claimed that the company is a potentially responsible party as a generator of waste materials for alleged pollution at a number of waste sites operated by third parties located principally in new jersey and seek to recover costs incurred and to be incurred to clean up the sites

the waste site claims and suits usually involve million dollar amounts and most of them are asserted against many potentially responsible parties remedial activities typically consist of several phases carried out over a period of years most site remedies begin with investigation and feasibility studies followed by physical removal destruction treatment or containment of contaminated soil and debris and sometimes by groundwater monitoring and treatment to date the company’s financial responsibility for some sites has been settled through agreements granting the company in exchange for one or more cash payments made or to be made either complete release of liability or for certain sites release from further liability for early andor later remediation phases subject to certain ‘‘reopener’’ clauses for laterdiscovered conditions settlements in respect of some sites involve in part payment by the company and other parties of a percentage of the site’s future remediation costs over a period of years

the company believes that the amounts it has paid and anticipates paying in the future for cleanup costs and damages at all sites are not and will not be material to the company’s financial condition results of operations or liquidity because of the involvement of other large potentially responsible parties at most sites because payment will be made over an extended time period and because pursuant to an agreement reached in july 1994 with three of the company’s liability insurers defense costs and indemnity amounts payable by the company in respect of the sites will be shared by the insurers up to an agreed amount

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend organization of information

management’s discussion and analysis provides a narrative on the company’s operating performance financial condition and liquidity and should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements it includes the following sections

            executive overview

the company is a leading creator and manufacturer of flavor and fragrance compounds used to impart or improve the flavor or fragrance in a wide variety of consumer products the precise size of the global market for flavors and fragrances is difficult to determine because the industry is highly fragmented both geographically and along product lines there are few publicly traded companies in the industry certain customers maintain inhouse capabilities fulfilling a portion of their flavor or fragrance needs and the quality and depth of market information in developing regions of the world is limited analysts generally estimate the global market to be 11 – 12 billion of which iff represents approximately 17 – 18 the company’s nearest sized competitor is of similar size although it is in the process of acquiring another flavor and fragrance supplier which will result in it being substantially larger than iff currently the five largest companies in the industry combined represent approximately 65 – 70 of the global market

fragrance compounds are used in perfumes cosmetics toiletries hair care products deodorants soaps detergents and softeners as well as air care products major fragrance customers include the cosmetics industry including perfume and toiletries manufacturers and the household products industry including manufacturers of soaps detergents household cleaners and air fresheners flavor products are sold to the food and beverage industries for use in consumer products such as prepared foods beverages dairy food and confectionery products the company is also a leading manufacturer of synthetic ingredients used in making fragrances approximately 55 of the company’s ingredient production is consumed internally the balance is sold to third party customers

changing social habits resulting from such factors as changes in disposable income leisure time health concerns urbanization and population growth stimulate demand for consumer products utilizing flavors and fragrances these developments expand the market for products with finer fragrance quality as well as the market for colognes and toiletries such developments also stimulate demand for convenience foods soft drinks and lowfat food products that must conform to expected tastes these developments necessitate the creation and development of flavors and fragrances and ingredients that are compatible with newly introduced materials and methods of application used in consumer products

flavors and fragrances are generally

    flavors and fragrances have similar economic and operational characteristics including research and development the nature of the creative and production processes the manner in which products are distributed and the type of customer many of the company’s customers purchase both flavors and fragrances

the flavor and fragrance industry is impacted by macroeconomic factors in all product categories and geographic regions such factors include the impact of currency on the price of raw materials and operating costs as well as on translation of reported results in addition pricing pressure placed on the company’s customers by large and powerful retailers and distributors is inevitably passed along to the company and its competitors leadership in innovation and creativity mitigates the impact of pricing pressure success and growth in the industry is dependent upon creativity and innovation in meeting the many and varied needs of the customers’ products in a costefficient and effective manner and with a consistently high level of timely service and delivery

the company produces more than 31000 unique compounds of which approximately 60 are flavors and 40 fragrances the company continually creates new compounds to meet the changing characteristics and needs of its customers’ end products no single compound represents more than 1 of net sales development of fragrances and flavors is a complex technical and artistic process calling upon the combined knowledge and talents of creative perfumers and flavorists and application and research chemists an important element of creation is the development of new ingredients the company bears essentially all costs incurred in connection with the creation and development of new flavors and fragrances and such formulae are generally protected under trade secrecy the company is not materially dependent on any patents trademarks or licenses

the company’s strategic direction is defined by the following

  the company’s plan to achieve this strategy is to

     as implementation of our strategy progresses setting strategic initiatives requires regular establishment and reassessment of priorities and necessitates choices in order to provide the best opportunity for continuous improvement in shareholder value

research and development ‘‘rd’’ expenses were 89 of sales spending in 2007 is expected to remain at approximately 90 of sales

selling general and administrative ‘‘sga’’ expenses were 168 of sales compared to 170 in 2005 the 2005 results included 8 million relating to a product contamination matter 2006 results reflect a benefit of 3 million insurance recovery related to this contamination matter the company benefited from the elimination of 129 positions mainly in north america and europe which resulted in savings in sga expense of 8 million the 2006 results also include 31 million in incentive compensation expense driven by improved sales and operating performance 2005 results included 5 million of such expense

2005 in comparison to 2004

cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales increased 150 basis points compared with 2004 mainly due to higher raw material costs which the company was unable to fully recover through increased selling prices overall the average cost of raw materials purchased increased 5 – 6 in 

comparison to the prior year cost of sales include 3 million attributable to a vendorsupplied raw material contamination issue primarily testing costs and the writeoff of affected materials cost of goods sold was also impacted by lower expense absorption attributable to the facility closure in dijon and the cost of transfer of related production to other manufacturing locations production at dijon ceased in march 2005

research and development ‘‘rd’’ expenses increased to 90 of sales consistent with the company’s stated intention to expand its research initiatives

income taxes

the effective tax rate for 2006 2005 and 2004 was 277 216 and 302 respectively the effective tax rate fluctuates as a result of earnings in the countries in which the company operates the 2005 rate was significantly reduced due to a tax benefit associated with the american jobs creation act ‘‘ajca’’ which provided for a onetime tax deduction of 85 of dividends received on eligible repatriated foreign earnings tax expense in 2005 reflects a benefit of 25 million relating to the repatriation of 242 million of dividends under ajca excluding this benefit the effective tax rate for 2005 would have been 316

operating cash flow in 2005 declined compared to 2004 primarily as a result of the decline in both sales and operating results the impact of the lower operating results was increased by unfavorable changes in both receivables and payables and a noncash adjustment to deferred income taxes related to the ajca tax benefit

net investing activities in 2006 utilized 31 million compared to 91 million and 31 million in 2005 and 2004 respectively investing cash outflows fluctuated in part due to the level of capital expenditures which totaled 58 million in 2006 compared to 93 million in 2005 and 71 million in 2004 fluctuations in spending between years is subject to the timing and stage of completion of

the company operates on a global basis and is exposed to currency fluctuation related to the manufacture and sale of products in currencies other than the us dollar the major foreign currencies involve the markets in the european union mexico brazil china indonesia australia and japan although all regions are subject to foreign currency fluctuations the company actively monitors its foreign currency exposures in all major markets in which it operates and employs a variety of techniques to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations including foreign currency hedging activities the company enters into foreign currency forward contracts with the objective of reducing exposure to cash flow volatility associated with foreign currency receivables and payables and with anticipated purchases of certain raw materials used in operations these contracts the counterparties to which are major international financial institutions generally involve the exchange of one currency for a second currency at a future date and have maturities not exceeding six months the notional amount and maturity dates of such contracts match those of the underlying transactions the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recorded in earnings at the same time as the transaction being hedged is recorded in earnings the associated asset or liability on the open hedge instrument is recorded in current assets or current liabilities as applicable

the company has executed a 10year yen – us dollar currency swap related to the monthly sale and purchase of products between the us and japan the annual notional value of this swap is 5 million gains and losses related to this swap are recorded currently and the marktomarket adjustment related to the value of the swap is reflected as a component of aoci

critical accounting policies and use of estimates

preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states ‘‘gaap’’ requires estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and accompanying disclosures these estimates are based on management’s best judgment of current events and actions that the company may undertake in the future actual results may ultimately differ materially from estimates although management does not believe such changes will materially affect the financial statements in any individual year

those material areas requiring the greatest degree of management judgment or deemed most critical to the company’s financial reporting involve

the periodic assessment of potential impairment of intangible assets acquired in business combinations intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually in assessing its intangible assets management uses the most current actual and forecasted operating data available current market based assumptions and independent valuation experts a two step approach is employed 

the first step involves estimating the value of reporting units based on the present value of estimated future cash flows the second step if necessary is to measure the value of the impairment loss if any management’s most subjective assumptions relate to the estimatedprojected sales and operating growth values employed in the forecast

the analysis and evaluation of income taxes the company accounts for taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 109 accounting for income taxes ‘‘fas 109’’ under fas 109 deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities based on tax laws as currently enacted the provision for income taxes is based on statutory income tax rates and planning opportunities available in the various tax jurisdictions where the company operates significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and tax positions the company may be challenged upon review by the applicable taxing authority and positions taken by the company may not be sustained the company regularly updates these accruals in light of changing facts and circumstances

in june 2006 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fas 109 ‘‘fin 48’’ the interpretation contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with fas 109 the first step is to evaluate the tax positions for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate resolution in implementing fin 48 the company will need to evaluate individual tax benefits using these evaluation methods and will need to make judgments on how to disaggregate its various tax positions and then to analyze the tax positions the company is required to adopt fin 48 at the beginning of 2007 the company is currently assessing the potential impact of this interpretation but does not believe its adoption will have a material impact on the company’s results or financial condition

the evaluation of potential legal and environmental liabilities where changing circumstances rules and regulations require regular reassessment of related practices and anticipated costs the company is subject to certain legal claims regarding products and other matters as well as environmentalrelated matters significant management judgment is involved in determining when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the extent to which it can be reasonably estimated

the company regularly assesses potential liabilities with respect to all legal claims based on the most recent available information in consultation with outside counsel handling the defense of such matters and other relevant independent experts to the extent a liability is deemed to have been incurred and can be reasonably estimated the company recognizes a corresponding accrual if the reasonably estimated liability is a range the company recognizes that amount considered most likely or in the absence of such a determination the minimum reasonably expected liability to the extent such claims are covered by insurance the company separately evaluates the likelihood of recovery and accounts for any related insurance receivable management judgments involve a determination as to whether a liability has been incurred the reasonably estimated amount of that liability and any potential insurance recovery

the company regularly evaluates its potential environmental exposure in terms of total estimated cost and with respect to the viability of other potentially responsible parties ‘‘prp’s’’ associated with its exposure recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress and additional information becomes available critical management assumptions relate to expected total costs to remediate and the financial viability of prp’s to share such costs

determination of the various assumptions employed in the valuation of pension and retiree health care expense and associated obligations amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined from actuarial valuations inherent in such valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets 

discount rates at which the liabilities could be settled rates of increase in future compensation levels mortality rates and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are updated annually in accordance with gaap actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore affect expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods

with respect to the us plans the expected return on plan assets was determined based on an asset allocation model using the current benchmark allocation real rates of return by asset class and an anticipated inflation rate the benchmark asset allocation was 10 – 20 in cash and fixed income investments expected to yield 10 10 – 20 employed in corporate and government bonds expected to yield 21 and 65 – 75 in equity investments with a longterm expected yield of 85 – 93 the inflation rate assumed in the model was 25 the plan has achieved a compound annual rate of return of 96 over the previous 20 years the discount rate used for determining future pension obligations for each individual plan is based on a review of longterm bonds that receive a high rating from a recognized rating agency the discount rate was based on the internal rate of return for a portfolio of moody’s aa3rated high quality bonds with maturities that are consistent with the projected future benefit payment obligations of the plan the rate of compensation increase for all plans and the medical cost trend rate for the applicable us plans are based on plan experience

with respect to the nonus plans the expected return on plan assets was determined based on an asset allocation model for each plan using an allocation designed to meet the needs of the plan or in certain cases specific government requirements rates of return by asset class and an anticipated inflation rate the discount rate used for determining future pension obligations for each plan is based on a review of longterm bonds that receive a high rating from a recognized rating agency with durations comparable to that of the plan liabilities and other criteria appropriate for the local market the rate of compensation increase is based on plan experience and expected increases

management establishes the assumptions concerning discount rates and actuarial assumptions based on current market conditions including asset returns and other factors applicable under the circumstances changes in pension and other postemployment benefits and associated expenses may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions the impact a 25 decrease in the discount rate or a 1 change in the medical cost trend rate would have on the company’s pension and other postemployment benefit expense as applicable is discussed in note 14

the ongoing assessment of the valuation of inventory given the large number of natural ingredients employed the quality of which may be diminished over time the company maintains between 40 and 55 of its inventory as raw materials providing the greatest degree of flexibility in manufacture and use materials are evaluated based on shelf life known uses and anticipated demand based on forecasted customer order activity and changes in productsales mix company policy provides for an ongoing assessment of inventory with adjustments recorded when an item is deemed to be slow moving or obsolete

determination of various assumptions employed in the calculation of equity compensation expense amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to equity compensation are determined based on the number of awards and type of award as well as specific assumptions regarding expected life stock price volatility risk free interest rate and the dividend yield these assumptions are employed in the binomial latticepricing model used to value certain awards

the company changed its valuation model used for estimating the fair value of optionsssar’s granted on january 1 2006 from a blackscholes optionpricing model to a binomial latticepricing model the binomial model can accommodate a broader array of inputs such as stock price volatility and interest rates the blackscholes model does not allow for incorporation of changes in such variables the company utilizes historical information to estimate expected term and forfeitures within the valuation model the expected term of an option is based on historical exercise behavior vesting terms and a contractual life of primarily ten years for options 

and seven years for ssar’s the riskfree interest rate for periods within the expected term of the award is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant expected volatility is based on an average of implied and historical volatility of the price of the company’s common stock over the calculated expected term the company anticipates paying cash dividends in the future and therefore uses an expected dividend yield in the valuation model the cash dividend in effect at the time of grant was employed in this calculation these assumptions are evaluated at each grant date if factors change and the company employs different assumptions for estimating sharebased compensation expense in future periods or if the company decides to use a different valuation model the future periods may differ significantly from what the company has recorded in the current period and could materially affect operating income net income and net income per share

management believes that it has considered relevant circumstances that the company may be currently subject to and the financial statements accurately reflect management’s best estimate of the results of operations financial condition and cash flows of the company for the years presented management has discussed the decision process and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors

new accounting standards

in december 2004 the fasb issued fas 123r which is effective for the first reporting period beginning after december 15 2005 fas 123r supersedes apb 25 and establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services under fas 123r the company must determine the fair value model to be used for valuing sharebased payments the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption the company is employing the binomial latticepricing model and recognizes the cost of all employee stock options on a straightline basis over their respective vesting periods net of estimated forfeitures the company adopted the new standard in 2006 adoption reduced 2006 annual earnings by 2 million based on unvested options outstanding this impact does not contemplate awards issued cancelled or forfeited in 2006 or the tax impact related to the initial adoption of this standard further details are included in note 12

in june 2006 the fasb issued fin 48 which clarifies the application of fas 109 by prescribing the minimum threshold a tax position must meet before being recognized in the financial statements under fin 48 the financial statement effect of a tax position is initially recognized when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination a tax position that meets the ‘‘more likely than not’’ recognition threshold is initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of benefit determined on a cumulative probability basis that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority fin 48 is effective for years beginning after december 15 2006 the company is currently assessing the potential impact of this interpretation but does not believe its adoption will have a material impact on the company’s results or financial condition

nongaap financial measures

to supplement the company’s financial results presented in accordance with gaap the company uses and has included in this report certain nongaap financial measures these nongaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap these nongaap financial measures as disclosed by the company may also be calculated differently from similar measures disclosed by other companies to ease the use and understanding of such supplemental nongaap financial measures the company includes the most directly comparable gaap financial measure and the reconciliation amount

the company uses a nongaap financial measure which excludes the results of its european fruit business disposed of in 2005 for preparing financial targets internal budgets and operating plans evaluating actual performance against targets and budget assessing historical performance over reporting periods and assessing operating performance against other companies a material limitation is that 2005 results under gaap in fact reflect the fruit business results management compensates for such limitation by clarifying that this measure is only one operating metric used for internal financial analysis and planning purposes and should not be considered in isolation and by providing the corresponding gaap financial measure

the company uses the nongaap financial measure which excludes the effect of the ajca in evaluating actual performance management believes that given the unique nature of this item including this information without the impact of repatriation in the prior year period is more representative of the company’s performance and may assist investors in evaluating the company’s period to period financial results and tax rate in a manner consistent with how management evaluates this

the company also discloses and management internally monitors the sales performance of international operations on a basis that eliminates the positive or negative effects that result from translating foreign currency sales into us dollars management uses this constant dollar measure because it believes that it enhances the assessment of the sales performance of its international operations and the comparability between reporting periods

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

the company enters into foreign currency forward contracts with the objective of reducing exposure to cash flow volatility associated with foreign currency receivables and payables and with anticipated purchases of certain raw materials used in operations these contracts the counterparties to which are major international financial institutions generally involve the exchange of one currency for a second currency at a future date and have maturities not exceeding six months

the company also uses derivative financial instruments to hedge foreign currency exposures resulting from forecasted purchase commitments the company enters into these hedge contracts generally for periods ranging from one to three months the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recorded in earnings at the same time as the transaction being hedged is recorded in earnings the associated asset or liability related to the open hedge instrument is recorded in current assets or current liabilities as applicable the company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes

the company has executed a 10year yen – us dollar currency swap related to the monthly sale and purchase of products between the us and japan the annual notional value of this swap is 5 million gains and losses related to this swap are recorded currently and the marktomarket adjustment related to the value of the swap is reflected as a component of aoci

in 2002 the company entered into certain interest rate swap agreements effectively converting the fixed rate on its longterm japanese yen borrowings to a variable shortterm rate based on the japanese yen libor rate plus an interest markup these swaps are designated as qualified fair value hedges the net gains have been deferred are classified as a separate component of debt and are being amortized over the remaining term of the debt to the extent the company has not received cash or otherwise amended or settled any swap agreements any applicable marktomarket adjustment relating to that swap is included as a separate component of debt the company had no ineffective interest rate swaps at december 31 2006

in january 2006 the company entered into a 300 million cross currency interest rate swap transaction to hedge a portion of its consolidated euro net investment the derivative was structured as a swap of floating usd libor to floating euribor with both floating interest rates reset and paid semiannually ensuring that the terms of the swap match identically because the derivative is structured as a floating to floating swap the only value other than that derived from changes in the foreign exchange fx spot rate are interest rate accruals which are reset semiannually these accruals are netted and booked in current earnings marktomarket changes due to differences in the underlying fx rate are recorded in aoci and provide an offset to the cumulative translation adjustment of the underlying euro assets being hedged which are also being valued based on changes in the fx spot rate effectiveness is assessed quarterly at maturity or if the swap is terminated early any gain or loss will not be recorded to earnings but will be recorded to aoci until the euro net investment is divested

the company uses foreign currencyrate and interest ratesensitive instruments to hedge a certain portion of its existing and forecasted transactions the company expects that any change in value for the hedging instrument would be offset by a change in value related to the underlying transaction

the company’s hedges of its foreign currency exposure are not designed to and therefore cannot entirely eliminate the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on the company’s consolidated 

financial position results of operations and cash flows the company’s foreign currency swaps were analyzed at yearend to determine their sensitivity to exchange rate changes based on the outstanding balance of the company’s net investment hedge at december 31 2006 a hypothetical 10 change either an increase or a decrease in rates denominating this hedge would not represent a material potential change in earnings based on the outstanding balance of the other financial instruments at december 31 2006 a hypothetical 10 change either an increase or a decrease in fx rates prevailing at that date sustained for up to a year would not represent a material potential change in fair value earnings or cash flows

at december 31 2006 the company had 807 million of debt outstanding including 375 million of senior notes 304 million in bank and other borrowings and 128 million in longterm japanese yen denominated debt borrowings and interest rate swaps were analyzed at yearend to determine their sensitivity to interest rate changes based on the outstanding balance of all these financial instruments at december 31 2006 a hypothetical 10 change either an increase or a decrease in interest rates prevailing at that date sustained for one year would not represent a material potential change in fair value earnings or cash flows

over the past 20 years various federal and state authorities and private parties have claimed that the company is a potentially responsible party as a generator of waste materials for alleged pollution at a number of waste sites operated by third parties located principally in new jersey and seek to recover costs incurred and to be incurred to clean up the sites

the waste site claims and suits usually involve million dollar amounts and most of them are asserted against many potentially responsible parties remedial activities typically consist of several phases carried out over a period of years most site remedies begin with investigation and feasibility studies followed by physical removal destruction treatment or containment of contaminated soil and debris and sometimes by groundwater monitoring and treatment to date the company’s financial responsibility for some sites has been settled through agreements granting the company in exchange for one or more cash payments made or to be made either complete release of liability or for certain sites release from further liability for early andor later remediation phases subject to certain 

‘‘reopener’’ clauses for laterdiscovered conditions settlements in respect of some sites involve in part payment by the company and other parties of a percentage of the site’s future remediation costs over a period of years

the company believes that the amounts it has paid and anticipates paying in the future for cleanup costs and damages at all sites are not and will not be material to the company’s financial condition results of operations or liquidity because of the involvement of other large potentially responsible parties at most sites because payment will be made over an extended time period and because pursuant to an agreement reached in july 1994 with three of the company’s liability insurers defense costs and indemnity amounts payable by the company in respect of the sites will be shared by the insurers up to an agreed amount

organization of information

managements discussion and analysis provides a narrative on the companys operating performance financial condition and liquidity and should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements it includes the following sections

           executive overview

the company is a leading creator and manufacturer of flavor and fragrance compounds used to impart or improve the flavor or fragrance in a wide variety of consumer products the precise size of the global market for flavors and fragrances is difficult to determine because the industry is highly fragmented both geographically and along product lines there are few publicly traded companies in the industry certain customers maintain inhouse capabilities fulfilling a portion of their flavor or fragrance needs and the quality and depth of market information in developing regions of the world is limited analysts generally estimate the global market to be 11  12 billion of which iff represents 16  18 the companys nearest sized competitor is of similar size the five largest companies in the industry combined represent approximately 65  70 of the global market

fragrance compounds are used in perfumes cosmetics toiletries hair care products deodorants soaps detergents and softeners as well as air care products major fragrance customers include the cosmetics industry including perfume and toiletries manufacturers and the household products industry including manufacturers of soaps detergents household cleaners and air fresheners flavor products are sold to the food and beverage industries for use in consumer products such as prepared foods beverages dairy food and confectionery products the company is also a leading manufacturer of synthetic ingredients used in making fragrances approximately 60 of the companys ingredient production is consumed internally the balance is sold to third party customers

changing social habits resulting from such factors as increases in personal income and dualearner households leisure time health concerns urbanization and population growth stimulate demand for consumer products utilizing flavors and fragrances these developments expand the market for products with finer fragrance quality as well as the market for colognes and toiletries such developments also stimulate demand for convenience foods soft drinks and lowfat food products that must conform to expected tastes these developments necessitate the creation and development of flavors and fragrances and ingredients that are compatible with newly introduced materials and methods of application used in consumer products

flavors and fragrances are generally

    flavors and fragrances have similar economic and operational characteristics including research and development the nature of the creative and production processes the manner in which products are distributed and the type of customer many of the company’s customers purchase both flavors and fragrances

a breakdown of sales by principal product category is depicted in the graph below

2005 sales by category

the companys five largest customers comprise 32 of consolidated sales and its top thirty customers 56 these percentages have remained fairly constant for several years no customer accounts for 10 or more of sales a key factor for success is inclusion on major customers core supplier lists opening opportunities to win new business the company is currently on the majority of core supplier lists of its major customers participation in such lists is key to the company’s strategy for growth

the flavor and fragrance industry is impacted by macroeconomic factors in all product categories and geographic regions in addition pricing pressure placed on the companys customers by large and powerful retailers and distributors is inevitably passed along to the company and its competitors leadership in innovation and creativity mitigates to an extent the impact of pricing pressure success and growth in the industry is dependent upon creativity and innovation in meeting the many and varied needs of the customers products in a costefficient and effective manner and with a consistently high level of timely service and delivery

the company produces more than 33000 unique compounds of which approximately 60 are flavors and 40 fragrances the company continually creates new compounds to meet the changing characteristics and needs of its customers end products no single compound represents more than 15 of net sales development of fragrances and flavors is a complex artistic and technical process calling upon the combined knowledge and talents of creative perfumers and flavorists and application and research chemists an important contribution to the creation of new fragrances and flavors is the development of new ingredients the company bears essentially all costs incurred in connection with the creation and development of new flavors and fragrances and such formulae are generally protected under trade secrecy the company is not materially dependent on any patents trademarks or licenses

the companys recent strategic focus has been

    in the company’s view considerable progress against these strategic initiatives has been achieved the bba integration was completed quickly and associated savings exceeded those anticipated at the time the acquisition was announced customer service levels have improved to the point where on time deliveries exceed the 95 level with further improvement targeted the company has exited certain noncore businesses the last of which was sold in 2004 the quality and depth of the companys research and development efforts have improved significantly in the period 2003  2005 the company patented numerous new commerciallyviable ingredients for use in flavors and fragrances fifteen were patented in 2003 nine in 2004 and fifteen in 2005 a number of these newly developed ingredients have been used in flavor and fragrance compounds and in 2006 new ingredients and technologies are expected to play an important role in meeting the company’s growth objectives

moving forward the company is committed to

   as implementation of the strategy progresses setting strategic initiatives requires regular establishment and reassessment of identified priorities and necessitates choices in order to provide the best opportunity for continuous improvement in shareholder value

sales commentary

net sales for 2005 2004 and 2003 were as follows

 

the company manages its operations by major geographical region and considers destination sales a key performance measure although reported sales and earnings are affected by the weakening or strengthening of the us dollar this has not had a longterm effect on the underlying strength of the companys business

2005 sales by destination

the company acquired bba effective november 3 2000 in conjunction with the integration of bba and as part of restructuring the company certain noncore businesses hereinafter referred to as the ‘‘noncore businesses’’ were disposed of including the fruit preparations businesses in europe north and latin america the north american concentrates business and a portion of the aroma chemicals business acquired in the bba transaction the noncore businesses were disposed of in a series of transactions with third parties disposal of these businesses did not materially impact the companys operating results the north american concentrates business was disposed of in 2002 and the european fruit preparation business in 2004 the other noncore businesses were disposed of in 2001

operating results

the percentage relationship of cost of goods sold and other operating expenses to reported sales is detailed in the following table

 

cost of goods sold includes the cost of materials and manufacturing expenses raw materials generally constitute 70 of the total research expenses are for the development of new and improved products technical product support compliance with governmental regulations and help in maintaining relationships with customers who are often dependent on technological advances selling general and administrative expenses support the companys sales and operating levels

2005 in comparison to 2004

cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales increased 150 basis points compared with 2004 mainly due to higher raw material costs which the company was not able to fully recover through increased selling prices overall the average cost of raw materials purchased by the company increased 5 – 6 in comparison to the prior year gross margin was also negatively impacted by costs attributable to a vendorsupplied raw material contamination issue cost of sales include 30 in related costs comprised mainly of associated testing costs and the writeoff of affected materials cost of goods sold was also impacted by lower expense absorption attributable to the facility closure in dijon and the cost of transfer of related production to other manufacturing locations production at the dijon facility ceased in march 2005

research and development ‘‘rd’’ expenses increased to 90 of sales consistent with the company’s stated intention to expand its research initiatives spending in 2006 is expected to remain at approximately 90 of sales

selling general and administrative ‘‘sga’’ expenses as a percentage of sales increased to 170 from 168 sga expenses include 85 million related to the cost of customer damages attributable to the raw material contamination issue the company is seeking full indemnification from its supplier the supplier’s insurers and to the extent necessary its own insurers but no related insurance receivable has been recorded sga expenses also include 51 in equity compensation expense compared to 50 million in the prior year these costs were partially offset by lower accruals under the company’s various incentive plans

in 2005 cost of goods sold and sga include 22 and 45 respectively incurred in connection with the implementation of sap these costs relate to training and data conversion and are charged to operating expenses as incurred implementation of sap is essentially complete at december 31 2005

2004 in comparison to 2003

cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales declined 40 basis points compared with 2003 the improvement resulted from a combination of improved sales performance and better product mix from improved fine fragrance sales and the disposition of the lower margin european fruit business the company benefited from the elimination of 48 manufacturing positions in north america and europe which resulted in savings of approximately 21 the above benefits were partially offset by poor operating performance by the european fruit business for the period of time owned by the company and by weak absorption of expenses resulting from the transfer of production from the company’s facility in dijon france to other manufacturing plants

rd expenses increased to 86 of sales as the company continued to expand its research initiatives this increase is mainly as a result of the elimination of the fruit preparations business relative to other parts of the company’s business fruit preparations required less rd as a percentage of sales

sga expenses as a percentage of sales increased to 168 from 162 mainly from inclusion of 50 in equity compensation expense for which there was no comparable amount in the 2003 results and higher expense accruals under the company’s incentive compensation plans based on sales and operating performance the increase in global expenses as reported in note 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements mainly related to these expenses in may 2004 the company began using restricted stock units ‘‘rsu’s’’ rather than stock options as an element of the company’s incentive compensation plans for all eligible us  based employees and a majority of eligible overseas employees previously options had not been expensed as permitted under applicable accounting guidance vesting of the rsu’s for senior management is performance and time based for the remainder of eligible employees vesting is time based generally over a threeyear period

other income expense net

other income expense net was 33 income in 2005 53 expense in 2004 and 54 expense in 2003 in 2005 income resulted primarily from exchange gains and higher levels of interest income earned on higher cash balances exchange gains or losses were 28 29 and 16 in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively the exchange losses in 2004 were mainly the result of the company having us dollar positions in europe and latin america which resulted in exchange losses upon the weakening of the us dollar in comparison to the euro and other currencies in 2003 the company repurchased 2007 of longterm notes otherwise scheduled to mature in may 2006 purchases were made through a series of open market transactions funded with commercial paper as a result the company incurred a net loss of 42 which is included in other income expense net

income taxes

the effective tax rate for 2005 was 216 compared to 302 for 2004 and 315 for 2003 the 2005 rate was significantly reduced as a result of a tax benefit associated with the ajca the ajca enacted on october 22 2004 provided for a special onetime tax deduction of 85 of dividends received on eligible repatriated foreign earnings the deduction resulted in an approximate 525 federal tax rate on these earnings full year 2005 results include a net tax benefit of 247 relating to the companys repatriation of 2420 million of dividends from foreign subsidiaries under the provisions of ajca excluding the benefit of ajca the effective tax rate for 2005 would have been 316

the fluctuating rate over the threeyear period is primarily the result of tax planning initiatives and the benefit of combining various iff and bba legal entities into a single tax structure in the period 2003  2005 the tax rate also benefited from restructuring and other charges most of which were incurred in higher tax jurisdictions

critical accounting policies and use of estimates

preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states ‘‘gaap’’ requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and accompanying disclosures these estimates are based on management’s best judgment of current events and actions that the company may undertake in the future actual results may ultimately differ from estimates although management does not believe such changes will materially affect the financial statements in any individual year

those areas requiring the greatest degree of management judgment or deemed most critical to the company’s financial reporting involve

the periodic assessment of potential impairment of intangible assets acquired in business combinations the company currently has net intangible assets including goodwill of 7727 goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually in assessing its intangible assets management uses the most current actual and forecasted operating data available current market based assumptions and independent valuation experts a two step approach is employed the first step involves estimating the value of reporting units based on the present value of estimated future cash flows the second step if necessary is to measure the value of the impairment loss if any management’s most subjective assumptions relate to the estimatedprojected sales and operating growth values employed in the forecast

the analysis and evaluation of collectibility of accounts receivable the company sells to large global and regional firms the majority of sales are either madetoorder or products that the company also employs in its own manufacturing process as a raw material judgment is required in assessing the realization of receivable balances including assessment of the creditworthiness of the customers and in evaluating varying circumstances that may impact the financial stability of a customer allowances for loss on collection are established based on currently available relevant facts and are reevaluated and adjusted as additional information becomes available the company’s historical experience indicates the allowance recorded has been sufficient to cover any reasonably expected potential loss

the analysis and evaluation of income taxes the company accounts for taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 109 ‘‘fas 109’’ accounting for income taxes under fas 109 deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities based on tax laws as currently enacted the provision for income taxes is based on domestic and international statutory income taxes rates and planning opportunities available in the various tax jurisdictions where the company operates significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and tax positions the company may be challenged upon review by the applicable taxing authority and positions taken by the company may not be sustained the company regularly updates these accruals in light of changing facts and circumstances

the evaluation of potential legal and environmental liabilities where changing circumstances rules and regulations require regular reassessment of related practices and anticipated costs the company is subject to certain legal claims regarding products and other matters as well as environmentalrelated matters significant management judgment is involved in determining when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the extent to which it can be reasonably estimated

the company regularly assesses potential liabilities with respect to all legal claims based on the most recent available information in consultation with outside counsel handling the defense of such matters and other relevant independent experts to the extent a liability is deemed to have been incurred and can be reasonably estimated the company recognizes a corresponding liability if the reasonably estimated liability is a range the company recognizes that amount considered most likely or in the absence of such a determination the minimum reasonably expected liability to the extent such claims are covered by various insurance policies the company separately evaluates the likelihood of recovery and accounts for any related insurance receivable management judgments involve determination as to whether a liability has been incurred the reasonably estimated amount of that liability and any potential insurance recovery

the company regularly evaluates its potential environmental exposure in terms of total estimated cost and with respect to the viability of other potentially responsible parties ‘‘prp’s’’ associated with its exposure recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress and additional information becomes available critical management assumptions relate to expected total costs to remediate and the financial viability of prp’s to share such costs

determination of the various assumptions employed in the valuation of pension and retiree health care expense and associated obligations amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined from actuarial valuations inherent in such valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets discount rates at which the liabilities could be settled rates of increase in future compensation levels mortality rates and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in note 14 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore affect expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods

with respect to the us plans the expected return on plan assets was determined based on an asset allocation model using the current benchmark allocation real rates of return by asset class and an anticipated inflation rate the benchmark asset allocation was 10  20 in cash and fixed income investments expected to yield 11 10  20 employed in corporate and government bonds expected to yield 17  28 and 65  75 in equity investments with a longterm expected yield of 85  91 the inflation rate assumed in the model was 25 the plan has achieved a compound annual rate of return of 92 over the previous 15 years the expected annual rate of return for the nonus plans employs a similar set of criteria adapted for local investments inflation rates and in certain cases specific government requirements the discount rate used for determining future pension obligations for each individual plan is based on a review of longterm bonds that receive a high rating from a recognized rating agency additionally for the us plan 

the discount rate was based on the internal rate of return for a portfolio of moody’s aa3rated high quality bonds with maturities that are consistent with the projected future benefit payment obligations of the plan the rate of compensation increase for all plans and the medical cost trend rate for the applicable us plans are based on plan experience

management establishes the assumptions concerning discount rates and actuarial assumptions based on current market conditions including asset returns and other factors applicable under the circumstances changes in pension and other postemployment benefits and associated expenses may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions the impact that a 25 decrease in the discount rate or a 1 change in the medical cost trend rate would have on the company’s pension and other postemployment benefit expense as applicable is discussed in note 14 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements

the ongoing assessment of the valuation of inventory given the large number of natural ingredients employed the quality of which may be diminished over time the company maintains between 40 and 55 of its inventory as raw materials providing the greatest degree of flexibility in manufacture and use materials are evaluated based on shelf life known uses and anticipated demand based on forecasted customer order activity and changes in productsales mix management policy provides for an ongoing assessment of inventory with adjustments recorded when an item is deemed to be slow moving or obsolete

management believes that it has considered relevant circumstances that the company may be currently subject to and the financial statements accurately reflect management’s best estimate of the results of operations financial condition and cash flows of the company for the years presented management has discussed the decision process and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

the company enters into foreign currency forward contracts with the objective of reducing exposure to cash flow volatility associated with foreign currency receivables and payables and with anticipated purchases of certain raw materials used in operations these contracts the counterparties to which are major international financial institutions generally involve the exchange of one currency for a second currency at a future date and have maturities not exceeding six months

the company also uses derivative financial instruments to hedge foreign currency exposures resulting from forecasted purchase commitments the company enters into these hedge contracts generally for periods ranging from one to three months the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is 

recorded in earnings at the same time as the transaction being hedged is recorded in earnings the associated asset or liability related to the open hedge instrument is recorded in current assets or current liabilities as applicable

the company has executed a 10year yen  us dollar currency swap related to the monthly sale and purchase of products between the us and japan the annual notional value of this swap is approximately 50 million gains and losses related to this swap are recorded currently and the marktomarket adjustment related to the value of the swap is reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income

the company uses foreign currencyrate and interest ratesensitive instruments to hedge a certain portion of its existing and forecasted transactions the company expects that any change in value for the hedging instrument would be offset by a change in value related to the underlying transaction

the company’s hedges of its foreign currency exposure are not designed to and therefore cannot entirely eliminate the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on the company’s consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows the company’s foreign currency swaps were analyzed at yearend to determine their sensitivity to exchange rate changes based on the outstanding balance of these financial instruments at december 31 2005 a hypothetical 10 change either an increase or a decrease in rates prevailing at that date sustained for up to a year would not represent a material potential change in fair value earnings or cash flows

57th street new york city item 3 legal proceedings in september 2001 the company was named as a defendant in a purported class action brought against it in the circuit court of jasper county missouri on behalf of employees of a plant owned and operated by gilstermary lee corp in jasper missouri the plaintiffs allege that they sustained respiratory injuries in the workplace due to the use by gilstermary lee of a bba and iff flavor in january 2004 the court ruled that class action status was not warranted as a result of this decision each of 30 plaintiff cases is to be tried separately the company appealed a march 2004 judgment following a jury verdict in favor of one plaintiff and his spouse awarding 20 million in compensatory damages the company believes that the verdict is not supported by the evidence or the law in april 2004 another case was resolved by confidential settlement in june 2004 the trial court found in favor of the company in four additional plaintiffs cases although in november 2004 a new trial was ordered on the grounds that a juror failed to disclose sufficient background information this order is being appealed by the company in july 2004 another case was resolved and in december 2004 two additional cases were also resolved by confidential settlement in january 2005 12 additional parties filed in this matter as plaintiffs 10 eight other actions based on similar claims of respiratory illness are currently pending against the company and other flavor suppliers the parties are in the discovery phase in the action brought against the company and another flavor supplier by 22 former and current workers at a popcorn factory in marion ohio this case was filed in the court of common pleas cuyahoga county ohio and subsequently transferred to the court of common pleas of hamilton county ohio in may 2004 the company and another flavor supplier were named defendants in a lawsuit by 4 former workers at a ridgeway illinois factory in an action brought in the circuit court for the second judicial circuit gallatin county illinois and another concerning 11 other workers at this same plant was filed in july 2004 in cook county illinois against the company and another flavor supplier in june 2004 the company and 3 other flavor suppliers were named defendants in a lawsuit by 1 current worker at a sioux city iowa facility in an action brought in the iowa district court for woodbury county this case was subsequently removed to us district court for the northern district of iowa at sioux city and in september 2004 a flavor industry trade association and a consulting agency were added as defendants in june 2004 the company and 3 other flavor suppliers were named defendants in a lawsuit by one plaintiff in an action brought in the court of common pleas hamilton county ohio in june 2004 the company and 3 other flavor suppliers were named defendants in a lawsuit by 1 former worker at a northlake illinois facility in an action brought in the circuit court of cook county illinois in june 2004 the company 4 other flavor suppliers and other unnamed parties were named defendants in a lawsuit by 1 former worker at an iowa city iowa facility in an action filed in us district court for the northern district of iowa in august 2004 the company and another flavor supplier were named defendants in a lawsuit by 19 former workers at a marion ohio factory in an action brought in the court of common pleas marion county ohio the company believes that all iff and bba flavors at issue in these matters meet the requirements of the us food and drug administration and are safe for handling and use by workers in food manufacturing plants when used according to specified safety procedures these procedures are detailed in instructions that iff and bba provided to all their customers for the safe handling and use of their flavors it is the responsibility of iffs customers to ensure that these instructions which include the use of appropriate engineering controls such as adequate ventilation prior handling procedures and respiratory protection for workers are followed in the workplace as regards to the missouri cases based on an interim report issued by the national institute for occupational safety and health niosh it appears any injuries the plaintiffs may have suffered are related to inadequate workplace conditions an article in the august 1 2002 new england journal of medicine confirmed nioshs preliminary findings that any injuries sustained by the plaintiffs could have been prevented if safety precautions consistent with those recommended by the company had been followed at each balance sheet date or more frequently as conditions warrant the company reviews the status of each pending claim as well as its insurance coverage for such claims with due consideration given to potentially applicable deductibles retentions and reservation of rights under its insurance policies and the advice of its outside legal counsel and a third party expert in modeling insurance deductible amounts with respect to all these matters while the ultimate outcome of any litigation cannot be predicted with certainty management believes that adequate provision has been made with respect to all known claims based on information presently available and in light of the merits of its defenses and the availability of insurance the company does not expect the outcome of the above cases singly or in the aggregate to have an adverse effect on the companys financial condition results of operation or liquidity there can be no assurance that future events will not require the company to increase the amount it has accrued for any matter or accrue for a matter that has not been previously accrued see note 17 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements over the past 20 years various federal and state authorities and private parties have claimed that the company is a potentially responsible party as a generator of waste materials for alleged pollution at a number of waste sites operated by third parties located principally in new jersey and seek to recover costs incurred and to be incurred to clean up the sites the waste site claims and suits usually involve million dollar amounts and most of them are asserted against many potentially responsible parties remedial activities typically consist of several phases carried out over a period of years most site remedies begin with investigation and feasibility studies followed by physical removal destruction treatment or containment of 11 contaminated soil and debris and sometimes by groundwater monitoring and treatment to date the companys financial responsibility for some sites has been settled through agreements granting the company in exchange for one or more cash payments made or to be made either complete release of liability or for certain sites release from further liability for early andor later remediation phases subject to certain reopener clauses for laterdiscovered conditions settlements in respect of some sites involve in part payment by the company and other parties of a percentage of the sites future remediation costs over a period of years the company believes that the amounts it has paid and anticipates paying in the future for cleanup costs and damages at all sites are not and will not be material to the companys financial condition results of operations or liquidity because of the involvement of other large potentially responsible parties at most sites because payment will be made over an extended time period and because pursuan

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in millions except per share amounts organization of information managements discussion and analysis provides a narrative on the companys operating performance financial condition and liquidity and should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements it includes the following sections o executive overview o sales commentary o operating results o acquisitions and divestitures o restructuring and other charges o financial condition o market risk o critical accounting policies and use of estimates o new accounting standards o nongaap financial measures o cautionary statement under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 executive overview the company is a leading creator and manufacturer of flavor and fragrance compounds used to impart or improve the flavor or fragrance in a wide variety of consumer products the precise size of the global market for flavors and fragrances is difficult to determine because the industry is highly fragmented both geographically and along product lines there are few publicly traded companies in the industry certain customers maintain inhouse capabilities fulfilling a portion of their flavor or fragrance needs and the quality and depth of market information in developing regions of the world is limited analysts generally estimate the global market to be 11  12 billion of which iff represents 16  17 the companys nearest sized competitor is of similar size the five largest companies in the industry combined represent approximately 60  65 of the global market fragrance compounds are used in perfumes cosmetics toiletries hair care products deodorants soaps detergents and softeners as well as air care products major fragrance customers include the cosmetics industry including perfume and toiletries manufacturers and the household products industry including manufacturers of soaps detergents household cleaners and air fresheners flavor products are sold to the food and beverage industries for use in consumer products such as prepared foods beverages dairy food and confectionery products the company is also a leading manufacturer of synthetic ingredients used in making fragrances approximately 55 of the companys ingredient production is consumed internally the balance is sold to third party customers changing social habits resulting from such factors as increases in personal income and dualearner households leisure time health concerns urbanization and population growth stimulate demand for consumer products utilizing flavors and fragrances these developments expand the market for products with finer fragrance quality as well as the market for colognes and toiletries such developments also stimulate demand for convenience foods soft drinks and lowfat food products that must conform to expected tastes these developments necessitate the creation and development of flavors and fragrances and ingredients that are compatible with newly introduced materials and methods of application used in consumer products 16 flavors and fragrances are generally o created for the exclusive use of a specific customer o sold in solid or liquid form in amounts ranging from a few kilograms to many tons depending on the nature of the end product in which they are used o a small percentage of the volume and cost of the end product sold to the consumer and o a major factor in consumer selection and acceptance of the product flavors and fragrances have similar economic and operational characteristics including research and development the nature of the creative and production processes the manner in which products are distributed and the type of customer many of the companys customers purchase both flavors and fragrances a breakdown of sales by principal product category is depicted in the following graph the fruit business was disposed of in 2004 sales depicted below are for the period the fruit business was owned by the company 2004 sales by category graphic omitted   12 ingredients   3 fruit   42 flavor compounds   17 fine fragrance and toiletries   26 functional fragrances the companys five largest customers comprise 30 of consolidated sales and its top thirty customers 53 these percentages have been fairly constant for several years no one customer accounts for more than 10 of sales a key factor for success is inclusion on major customers core supplier lists opening opportunities to win new business the company is currently on the majority of core supplier lists of its major customers participation in such lists is key to the companys strategy for future growth the flavor and fragrance industry is impacted by macroeconomic factors in all product categories and geographic regions in addition pricing pressure placed on the companys customers by large and powerful retailers and distributors is inevitably passed along to the company and its competitors leadership in innovation and creativity mitigates the impact of pricing pressure success and growth in the industry is dependent upon creativity and innovation in meeting the many and varied needs of the customers products in a costefficient and effective manner and with a consistently high level of timely service and delivery the company produces more than 35000 unique compounds of which 60 are flavors and 40 fragrances the company continually creates new compounds to meet the changing characteristics and needs of its customers end products no individual compound represents more than 15 of net sales development of fragrances and flavors is a complex artistic and technical process calling upon the combined knowledge and talents of creative perfumers and flavorists and application and research chemists an important contribution to the creation of new fragrances and flavors is the development of new ingredients the company bears essentially all costs incurred in connection with the creation and development of new flavors and fragrances and such formulae are protected under trade secrecy the company is not materially dependent on any patents trademarks or licenses 17 the companys strategic focus in the three year period 2002  2004 has been o to integrate bush boake allen inc bba acquired in november 2000 and to reorganize the integrated organization under two global umbrellas of business development and operations business development encompasses consumer and market research product category strategy product development global sales and marketing and technical application operations are responsible for the customer supply chain o to improve customer service in terms of both ontime deliveries and responsiveness to new product development initiatives and to improve the win rate for new business with the companys customers o to critically evaluate the profitability and growth potential of the companys product portfolio and to focus on those categories and customers considered to be the best opportunities for longterm profitable growth o to focus research and development initiatives on those areas considered to be most likely in the longterm to yield the greatest value to the companys customers and shareholders in the threeyear period ended december 31 2004 considerable progress against these strategic initiatives was made the bba integration was completed quickly and associated savings exceeded those anticipated at the time the acquisition was announced customer service levels have improved to the point where on time deliveries exceed the 95 level with further improvement targeted the company has exited certain noncore businesses contributing to improved returns on sales and invested capital the last of these businesses was sold in 2004 the quality and depth of the companys research and development efforts have improved significantly in 2003 and 2004 the company patented numerous new commerciallyviable ingredients for use in flavors and fragrances fifteen were patented in 2003 and nine in 2004 a number of these ingredients were used in flavor and fragrance compounds in 2004 and in 2005  2006 new product introductions will play an important role in meeting our growth objectives moving forward the company is committed to o continuous improvement in operations and customer service supported by the global implementation of the enterprise requirements planning software package sap and related initiatives o research and development efforts in those aspects of flavors and fragrances and associated delivery mechanisms which the company has identified as most likely to drive profitable future growth the company anticipates that much of this research will be conducted internally but such efforts may be augmented by joint research undertakings and through acquisition of technology an essential aspect of the overall research efforts is the companys continued leadership in sensory science and consumer insight enabling the creation of consumerpreferred flavors and fragrances as implementation of the strategy progresses setting strategic initiatives requires regular establishment and reassessment of identified priorities and necessitates choices in order to provide the best opportunity for continuous improvement in shareholder value

of improved sales performance and better product mix from improved fine fragrance sales and the disposition of the lower margin european fruit business the company benefited from the elimination of 48 manufacturing positions in north america and europe which resulted in savings of approximately 21 the benefits of the improved sales performance and product mix were partially offset by poor operating performance by the european fruit business for the period of time owned by the company and by weak absorption of expenses resulting from the transfer of production from the companys facility in dijon

research initiatives in 2005 rd expenses are expected to be 90  92 of sales this increase is mainly as a result of the elimination of the fruit preparations business relative to other parts of the companys business fruit preparations required less rd as a percentage of sales selling general and administrative sga expenses as a percentage of sales increased to 168 from 162 the increase resulted

weakness in sales of higher margin fine fragrances had a negative impact on margins however the impact of unfavorable sales mix was substantially offset by reduced manufacturing expenses of approximately 35 the reduction in these expenses resulted from realizing the full year benefit from the closure of various plants in the preceding year such closures were directly related to the

and use of estimates preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and accompanying disclosures these estimates are based on managements best judgment of current events and actions that the company may undertake in the future actual results may ultimately differ from estimates although management does not believe such changes will materially affect the financial statements in any individual year those areas requiring the greatest degree of management judgment or deemed most critical to the companys financial reporting involve the periodic assessment of potential impairment of intangible assets acquired in business combination the company currently has net intangible assets including goodwill of 7897 goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred in assessing its intangible assets management uses the most current actual and forecasted operating data available current market based assumptions and independent valuation experts a two step approach is employed the first step involves estimating the value of reporting units based on the present value of estimated future cash flows the second step if necessary is to measure the value of the impairment loss if one is determined to exist managements most subjective assumptions relate to the estimatedprojected sales and operating growth values employed in the forecast 30 the analysis and evaluation of collectibility of accounts receivable the company sells to large global and regional firms the majority of sales are either madetoorder or products that the company also employs in its own manufacturing process as a raw material judgment is required in assessing the realization of receivable balances including assessment of the creditworthiness of the customers and in evaluating varying circumstances that may impact the financial stability of a customer allowances for loss on collection are established based on currently available relevant facts and are reevaluated and adjusted as additional information becomes available the companys historical experience indicates the allowance recorded has been sufficient to cover any reasonably expected potential loss with respect to its accounts receivable the analysis and evaluation of income taxes the company accounts for taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 109 fas 109 accounting for income taxes under fas 109 deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse the provision for income taxes is based on domestic and international statutory income taxes rates and planning opportunities available in the various tax jurisdictions where the company operates significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and tax positions the company may be challenged upon review by the applicable taxing authority and positions taken by the company may not be sustained the company and its affiliates update these accruals in light of changing facts and circumstances the evaluation of potential legal and environmental liabilities where changing circumstances rules and regulations require regular reassessment of related practices and anticipated costs the company is subject to certain legal claims regarding products and other matters as well as environmentalrelated matters significant management judgment is involved in determining when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the extent to which the liability can be reasonably estimated the company regularly assesses potential liabilities with respect to all legal claims based on the most recent available information in consultation with outside counsel handling the defense of such matters and other relevant independent experts to the extent a liability is deemed to have been incurred and can be reasonably estimated the company recognizes a corresponding liability if the estimated liability is a range the company recognizes that amount considered most likely or in the absence of such a determination the minimum expected liability to the extent such claims are covered by various insurance policies the company separately evaluates the likelihood of recovery and accounts for any related insurance receivable critical management judgments involve determination as to whether a liability has been incurred the extent of that liability and any potential recovery under the companys insurance coverage the company regularly evaluates its potential environmental exposure in terms of total estimated cost and also with respect to the viability of the other potentially responsible parties prps associated with its exposure the recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress and additional information becomes available critical management assumptions relate to expected total costs to remediate and the financial viability of prps to share such costs determination of the various assumptions employed in the valuation of pension and retiree health care expense and associated obligations amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined from actuarial valuations inherent in such valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets discount rates at which the liabilities could be settled rates of increase in future compensation levels mortality rates and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in note 14 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore affect expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods 31 with respect to the us plans the expected return on plan assets was determined based on an asset allocation model using the current benchmark allocation real rates of return by asset class and an anticipated inflation rate the benchmark asset allocation was 5  15 in cash and fixed income investments expected to yield 16 15  25 employed in corporate and government bonds expected to yield 17  28 and 65  75 in equity investments with a longterm expected yield of 80  90 the inflation rate assumed in the model was 25 the plan has achieved a compound rate of return of 102 over the previous 15 years the expected rate of return for the nonus plans employs a similar set of criteria adapted for local investments inflation rates and in certain cases specific government requirements discount rates used to determine future pension obligations of all plans are based on a review of longterm bonds that receive a high rating by a recognized rating agency where the maturity of the bonds reasonably match the demographics of plan participants the rate of compensation expense for all plans and the medical cost trend rate for the applicable us plans are based on plan experience management establishes the assumptions concerning discount rates and actuarial assumptions based on current market conditions including asset returns and other factors applicable under the

animal products they contain varying numbers of organic chemicals which are
responsible for the fragrance or flavor of the natural product the natural
products are purchased for the larger part in processed or semiprocessed form

item 3 legal proceedings

     on september 7 2001 the company was named as a defendant in a purported
class action brought against it in the circuit court of jasper county missouri
on behalf of employees of a plant owned and operated by gilstermary lee corp
in jasper missouri the plaintiffs are alleging that they sustained respiratory
injuries in the workplace due to the use by gilstermary lee of a bba and iff
flavor all bba and iff flavors meet the requirements of the u s food and drug
administration and are safe for handling and use by workers in food
manufacturing plants when used according to specified safety procedures based
on the preliminary report issued by the national institute for occupational
safety and health niosh it appears any injuries the plaintiffs may have
suffered are related to inadequate workplace conditions

     on january 15 2004 the court denied class action status through an order
requiring each plaintiff case to be heard separately trial proceedings in the
initial case commenced in march 2004 while the outcome of any litigation cannot
be predicted with certainty in light of the merits of its defense and


                                       10

the availability of insurance the company does not expect this litigation to
have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition results of
operations or liquidity

     on march 31 2003 the company and another flavor supplier were named
defendants in a lawsuit by a number of workers at a popcorn factory in marion
ohio alleging respiratory illness due to the use of butter flavors supplied by
the company and the other flavor manufacturer the action was brought in the
court of common pleas cuyahoga county ohio and subsequently transferred to
the court of common pleas of hamilton county ohio

     this case is currently in the preliminary stages of discovery while the
outcome of any litigation cannot be predicted with certainty in light of the
merits of its defenses and the availability of insurance the company does not
expect this litigation to have a material adverse effect on the companys
financial condition results of operation or liquidity

     over the past 20 years various federal and state authorities and private
parties have claimed that the company is a potentially responsible party as a
generator of waste materials for alleged pollution at a number of waste sites
operated by third parties located principally in new jersey and seek to recover
costs incurred and to be incurred to clean up the sites

     the waste site claims and suits usually involve million dollar amounts and
most of them are asserted against many potentially responsible parties remedial
activities typically consist of several phases carried out over a period of
years most site remedies begin with investigation and feasibility studies
followed by physical removal destruction treatment or containment of
contaminated soil and debris and sometimes by groundwater monitoring and
treatment to date the companys financial responsibility for some sites has
been settled through agreements granting the company in exchange for one or
more cash payments made or to be made either complete release of liability or
for certain sites release from further liability for early andor later
remediation phases subject to certain reopener clauses for laterdiscovered
conditions settlements in respect of some sites involve in part payment by
the company and other parties of a percentage of the sites future remediation
costs over a period of years

     the company believes that the amounts it has paid and anticipates paying in
the future for cleanup costs and damages at all sites are not and will not be
material to the companys financial condition results of operations or
liquidity because of the involvement of other large potentially responsible
parties at most sites because payment will be made over an extended time period
and because pursuant to an agreement reached in july 1994 with three of the
companys liability insurers defense costs and indemnity amounts payable by the
company in respect of the sites will be shared by the insurers up to an agreed
amount

executive overview

     the company is a leading creator and manufacturer of flavor and fragrance
compounds used to impart or improve the flavor or fragrance in a wide variety of
consumer products the precise size of the global market for flavors and
fragrances is difficult to determine because the industry is highly fragmented
both geographically and along product lines there are few publicly traded
companies in the industry limiting publicly available data certain customers
maintain inhouse capabilities fulfilling at least a portion of their flavor or
fragrance needs and the quality and depth of market information in developing
regions of the world is limited however analysts generally estimate the flavor
and fragrance market to be 1112 billion of which iff represents 16 the
companys nearest sized competitor is of similar size the five largest
companies in the industry represent 60  65 of the global market

     fragrance compounds are used in perfumes cosmetics toiletries hair care
products deodorants soaps detergents and softeners as well as air care
products major fragrance customers include the cosmetics industry including
perfume and toiletries manufacturers and the household products industry
including manufacturers of soaps detergents household cleaners and air
fresheners flavor products are sold to the food and beverage industries for use
in consumer products such as prepared foods beverages dairy food and
confectionery products the company is also a leading manufacturer of synthetic
ingredients used in making fragrances approximately 50 of the companys
ingredient production is consumed internally the balance of production is sold
to third party customers

     changing social habits resulting from such factors as increases in personal
income and dualearner households leisure time health concerns urbanization
and population growth stimulate demand for consumer products utilizing flavors
and fragrances these developments expand the market for products with finer
fragrance quality as well as the market for colognes and toiletries such
developments also stimulate demand for convenience foods soft drinks and
lowcholesterol and lowfat food products that must conform to expected tastes
these developments necessitate the creation and development of flavors and
fragrances and ingredients that are compatible with newly introduced materials
and methods of application used in consumer products

     flavors and fragrances are generally

     o   created for the exclusive use of a specific customer

     o   sold in solid or liquid form in amounts ranging from a few kilograms
         to many tons depending on the nature of the end product in which they
         are used

     o   a small percentage of the volume and cost of the end product sold to
         the consumer and

     o   a major factor in consumer selection and acceptance of the product

     flavors and fragrances have similar economic and operational
characteristics including research and development the nature of the creative
and production processes the manner in which products are distributed and the
type of customer many customers purchase both flavors and fragrances from the
company

     a breakdown of sales by principal product category is depicted in the

     the companys five largest customers comprise 29 of consolidated sales and
its top thirty customers 53 of sales these sales percentages have been fairly
constant for several years a key factor for success is inclusion on major
customers core supplier lists opening opportunities to win new business the
company is currently on the majority of core supplier lists of its major
customers

     the flavor and fragrance industry is impacted by macroeconomic factors in
all product categories and geographic regions in addition pricing pressure
placed on the companys customers by large and powerful retailers and
distributors is inevitably passed along to the company and its competitors
success and growth in the industry is dependent upon creativity and innovation
in meeting the many and varied needs of the customers products in a
costefficient and effective manner and a consistently high level of timely
service and delivery leadership in innovation and creativity serves to mitigate
the impact of pricing pressure

     the company produces more than 35000 unique compounds annually of which
60 are flavors and 40 fragrances in addition the company continually creates
new compounds to meet the many and varied characteristics and needs of its
customers end products no individual compound represents more than 15 of net
sales the development of fragrances and flavors is a complex artistic and
technical process calling upon the combined knowledge and talents of creative
perfumers and flavorists and application and research chemists an important
contribution to the creation of new fragrances and flavors is the development of
new ingredients the company bears essentially all costs incurred in connection
with the creation and development of new flavors and fragrances and such
formulae are protected under trade secrecy the company is not materially
dependent on any patents trademarks or licenses

     the companys strategic focus in the three year period 2001  2003 has
been

     o   to integrate bush boake allen inc bba acquired in november 2000
         and the company and to reorganize the integrated organization under
         two global umbrellas of business development and operations business
         development encompasses consumer and market research product category
         strategy product development global sales and marketing and technical
         application operations are responsible for the customer supply chain
         reorganization was necessary to streamline the companys operations
         eliminating costs and improving asset utilization in view of
         persistent price pressure from many of the companys customers

     o   to improve customer service in terms of both ontime deliveries and
         responsiveness to new product development initiatives and to improve
         the win rate for new business with the companys customers

     o   to critically evaluate the profitability and growth potential of the
         companys product portfolio

     o   to revitalize and redirect research and development initiatives to
         those areas considered to be most likely in the longterm to yield
         the greatest value to the companys customers and shareholders

     in the three year period ended december 2003 considerable progress against
these strategic initiatives has been made the bba integration was completed
quickly and associated savings exceeded the 70 million anticipated at the time
the acquisition was announced customer service levels have improved to the
point where on time deliveries exceed the 95 level with further improvement
targeted as a result the company has been placed back on a number of core
supplier lists it had not been on the company exited certain noncore
businesses contributing to improved returns on sales and invested capital the
quality and depth of the companys research and development efforts has improved
significantly in 2003 the company patented fifteen new commerciallyviable
ingredients for use in flavors and fragrances these ingredients will begin to
be commercialized in flavor and fragrance compounds in 2004

     moving forward the company remains committed to

     o   continuous improvement in operations and customer service supported by
         the global implementation of an enterprise requirements planning
         software package sap and related initiatives

     o   research and development efforts in those aspects of flavors and
         fragrances and associated delivery mechanisms which the company has
         identified as most likely to drive profitable future growth the
         company anticipates that much of this research will be conducted
         internally but such efforts may be augmented by joint research
         undertakings and through acquisition of technology

     the next stage in setting strategic initiatives will require establishing
priorities and making choices in order to provide the best opportunity for
continuous improvement in shareholder value

         from several new product introductions

         benefited from the stronger euro and pound sterling on translation of
         local currency results into the us dollar the local currency sales
         performance reflected persistent economic weakness throughout the
         european region local currency fragrance sales in europe declined 5

         increasing 4 in dollars fragrance sales increased 7 in local
         currency and 12 in dollars the fragrance growth was driven by a
         number of new product introductions throughout the region most notably
         in thailand greater china and indonesia sales were strongest in
         thailand vietnam indonesia and greater china with local currency
         increases of 25 14 9 and 6 respectively these strong
         performances were partially offset by persistent weakness in japan and
         the philippines where local currency sales declined 7 and 18
         respectively

     o   latin america flavor sales increased 9 the flavor sales performance
         was driven by increases of 80 31 and 19 in central america

         environment

sales would have increased 1 regional sales performance in 2002 was as
follows

     o   north america flavor and fragrance sales declined 7 and 1
         respectively the flavor sales decline resulted primarily from the sale
         of noncore businesses in both 2002 and 2001 excluding sales of 94
         and 422 attributable to these businesses in 2002 and 2001

         currency results into the us dollar local currency sales were

         south korea and greater china with respective local currency increases
         of 49 14 10 and 6 these strong performances were substantially
         offset by persistent weakness in japan and indonesia where local
         currency sales declined 6 and 7 respectively

     o   latin america sales performance was affected by the loss of sales
         attributable to noncore businesses disposed of in 2001 although the
         primary cause of the decline was the economic weakness that persisted

     in 2003 cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales remained comparable
with 2002 levels product mix mainly due to weakness in sales of higher margin
fine fragrances had a negative impact on margins however the impact of
unfavorable sales mix was substantially offset by reduced manufacturing
expenses the reduction in these expenses resulted from realizing the full year
benefit derived from the closure of various plants in the prior year such
closures were directly related to the integration of bba into iff in addition
the company undertook certain restructuring activities in 2003 eliminating 171
manufacturing positions these actions saved approximately 35 in 2003
contributing 10 basis points to margin improvement

in 2005 as the project nears completion

  2002 in comparison to 2001

     cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales declined slightly from 2001
levels the decline resulted from improvement in product mix mainly due to the
disposal of the noncore businesses and the closure of certain manufacturing
facilities in connection with the integration of bba in addition the company
undertook certain restructuring activities eliminating 127 manufacturing
positions these actions saved approximately 37 in 2002 contributing 20
basis points to margin improvement in 2002 these savings were partially offset
by increased manufacturing expenses related to the companys implementation of
sap and related initiatives and the impact of the economic and currency
disruption in latin america which reduced the absorption of fixed manufacturing
expenses and thus impacted profitability in that region total saprelated
costs in manufacturing expenses approximated 17 in 2002 there were no
similar expenses in 2001

  income taxes

     the effective tax rate for 2003 was 315 compared to 340 for 2002 and
382 for 2001 the lower rate in 2003 is the result of tax planning
initiatives and the benefits of combining various iff and bba legal entities
into a single tax structure in 2003 the tax rate also benefited from
restructuring and other charges most of which were incurred in higher tax
jurisdictions the lower rate in 2002 resulted from the discontinuance of
goodwill amortization such goodwill was not deductible for purposes of
determination of the companys taxable income the company anticipates that its
effective tax rate in 2004 will approximate 315

restructuring and other charges

     since 1999 the company has undertaken a series of actions associated with
the closure of company facilities and elimination of various employee
positions

     the actions undertaken in 1999 were initiated under a costcutting program
intended to streamline the companys operations worldwide the principal
locations affected were the united states the united kingdom the netherlands
and france with lesser impact in various locations in asia pacific and latin
america as a result the company recorded pretax charges of 409 elements of

were recorded in cost of goods sold 12 selling and administrative expenses
23 and other income and expense 45 the remaining actions related to
employee separation and assetrelated costs associated with both writedown and
disposal actions resulted in restructuring and other charges of 329 under
these actions 222 employees left the company

     as an element of the costcutting program the company offered a voluntary
early retirement incentive to certain usbased employees in the fourth
quarter of 1999 with notification of acceptance

in the first quarter of 2000 71 employees accepted resulting in a pretax
charge of 93 in 2000 the early retirement program completed the costcutting
program undertaken in 1999 at an overall cost of 502

a comprehensive analysis of its business development research and development
and operating activities and associated staffing levels in october 2000 the
company announced a significant reorganization entailing the elimination of
multiple layers of management closure of certain manufacturing facilities to
improve capacity utilization and the intended disposal of certain noncore
businesses on completion the reorganization was expected to yield annual
savings approximating 250 to 300 a portion of which was to be reinvested
in the business

     at the time the plan was announced it was anticipated that such actions
would take place over the ensuing 24 months and incur expected costs of 900 
1000 the integration of bba into iff and the reorganization proceeded
concurrently

     an element of the reorganization was a second voluntary early retirement
program extended to usbased employees which 85 employees accepted
resulting in pretax charges of 145 an additional 41 employees were
terminated by eliminating duplicate management positions at corporate regional
and affiliate locations resulting in the company recording pretax charges of
175 in total 197 employees were severed and the company recorded pretax
charges totaling 413 comprised of

     o   the first early retirement plan  93

south africa chile venezuela kenya texas and oregon as a result 465
employees were severed and the company recorded pretax charges totaling 301
101 related to employee terminations and 200 related to location closures
and asset writedowns

     during 2002 the company closed iff operations in australia discontinued
fragrance compounding in japan and sold its fruit concentrate business to a
third party as a result 148 employees were severed and the company recorded
pretax charges of 117 43 related to employee severance and 74 related
to location closures and asset writedowns

could only be undertaken upon completion of the integration of iff and bba
which was completed in the fourth quarter of 2002 the actions eliminated
duplicate employment functions and processes including several senior
corporate positions as well as regional and local levels the company
eliminated 321 positions and recorded pretax charges of 424 380 related
to employee terminations and 44 related to location closures and asset
writedowns the 2003 assetrelated charges relate principally to final
quantification of costs for previous actions taken

     with respect to all restructuring and other charges

     o   separation costs for the employees relate primarily to severance
         outplacement and other benefit costs

     o   asset writedown charges relate to establishment of the new carrying
         value for assets held for sale or disposal and

     o   other costs include lease termination costs and other reorganization
         expenses incurred to effect either the employee separation or location
         closure

     since october 2000 the company recorded pretax charges of 1161 in
comparison to the 9001000 forecast at the time the plan was announced
the increase was due to additional actions taken in the final stages of the
reorganization and the impact the weaker us dollar had on the translation of
the cost of actions undertaken outside the united states

currency exposures in all major markets in which it operates and employs a

currency forward contracts with the objective of reducing exposure to cash flow
volatility associated with foreign currency receivables and payables and with
anticipated purchases of certain raw materials used in operations these
contracts the counterparties to which are major international financial
institutions generally involve the exchange of one currency for a second

critical accounting policies and use of estimates

     the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to use judgment and to make
estimates and assumptions that affect reported assets liabilities revenues
and expenses actual results may differ from such estimates the diversity of
the companys products customers geographic operations sources of supply and
markets reduces the risk that any one event would have a severe impact on the
companys operating results the company recognizes revenue when products are
shipped and title and risk of loss transfer to the customer the greatest
complexity of the companys business is in the area of research and development
and creation of new products for which all costs are expensed as incurred

     those areas requiring the greatest degree of management judgment or deemed
most critical to the companys financial reporting involve

     o   the periodic assessment of potential impairment of intangible assets
         acquired in business combinations


                                       28
page

     o   the evaluation of potential environmental and legal liabilities where
         frequently changing rules regulations and circumstances require
         constant reassessment of related practices and anticipated costs

     o   determination of the various assumptions employed in the valuation of
         pension and retiree health care expense and associated obligations

     o   recoverability and realization of assets most notably in lesser
         developed areas of the world where fluctuating currencies and
         frequently unsettled economic conditions can create uncertainty

     o   the ongoing assessment of the valuation of inventory given the large
         number of natural ingredients employed the quality of which may be
         diminished over time and

     o   the determination of financial instruments employed as effective hedges
         of cash flows or market risk exposures

     management believes that full consideration has been given to all relevant
circumstances that the company may be currently subject to and the financial
statements accurately reflect managements best estimate of the results of
operations financial condition and cash flows of the company for the years
presented

numbers of organic chemicals which are responsible for the fragrance or flavor
of the natural product the natural products are purchased for the larger part
in processed or semiprocessed form some are used in compounds in the state in

item 3 legal proceedings

     on september 7 2001 the company was named as a defendant in a purported
class action brought against it in the circuit court of jasper county
missouri on behalf of employees of a plant owned and operated by gilstermary
lee corp in jasper missouri the plaintiffs are alleging that they sustained
respiratory injuries in the workplace due to the use by gilstermary lee of a
bba flavor all bba and iff flavors meet the requirements of the u s food and
drug administration and are safe for handling and use by workers in food
manufacturing plants when used according to specified safety procedures based
on the preliminary report issued by the national institute for occupational
safety and health niosh it appears any injuries the plaintiffs may have
suffered are related to inadequate workplace conditions

     this case is currently in discovery the company does not expect this
litigation to have a material adverse effect on the companys financial
condition results of operations or liquidity

     over the past 20 years various federal and state authorities and private
parties have claimed that the company is a potentially responsible party as a
generator of waste materials for alleged pollution at a number of waste sites
operated by third parties located principally in new jersey and seek to recover
costs incurred and to be incurred to clean up the sites

     the waste site claims and suits usually involve million dollar amounts
and most of them are asserted against many potentially responsible parties
remedial activities typically consist of several phases carried out over a
period of years most site remedies begin with investigation and feasibility
studies followed by physical removal destruction treatment or containment of
contaminated soil and debris and sometimes by groundwater monitoring and
treatment to date the companys financial


                                       7

responsibility for some sites has been settled through agreements granting the
company in exchange for one or more cash payments made or to be made either
complete release of liability or for certain sites release from further
liability for early andor later remediation phases subject to certain
reopener clauses for laterdiscovered conditions settlements in respect of
some sites involve in part payment by the company and other parties of a
percentage of the sites future remediation costs over a period of years at
present only three sites remain the subject of significant unsettled claims

     the company believes that the amounts it has paid and anticipates paying
in the future for cleanup costs and damages at all sites are not and will not
be material to the companys financial condition results of operations or
liquidity because of the involvement of other large potentially responsible
parties at most sites because payment will be made over an extended time
period and because pursuant to an agreement reached in july 1994 with three of
the companys liability insurers defense costs and indemnity amounts payable
by the company in respect of the sites will be shared by the insurers up to an
agreed amount

finished fragrance or flavor in their consumer products thousands of compounds
are produced by the company and new compounds are constantly being created in

flowers fruits and other botanical products as well as from animal products
they contain varying numbers of organic chemicals which are responsible for
the fragrance or flavor of the natural product the natural products are
purchased for the larger part in processed or semiprocessed form some are
used in compounds in the state in which they are purchased and others after
further processing natural products together with various chemicals are also
used as raw materials for the manufacture of synthetic ingredients by chemical
processes

market developments

stimulated and broadened by changing social habits resulting from various
factors such as increases in personal income employment of women teenage
population leisure time health concerns and urbanization and by the continued
growth in world population in the fragrance field these developments have
expanded the market for hair care candles and air care products and deodorant
and personal wash products with finer fragrance quality as well as the market
for colognes toilet waters mens toiletries and other products beyond
traditional luxury items such as perfumes in the flavor field similar market
characteristics have stimulated the demand for products such as convenience

found in natural substances and through chemical synthesis in order to develop
new materials and better techniques for utilization of such materials the

item 3  legal proceedings

   on september 7 2001 the company was named as a defendant in a purported
class action brought against it in the circuit court of jasper county
missouri on behalf of employees of a plant owned and operated by gilstermary
lee corp in jasper missouri the plaintiffs are alleging that they sustained
respiratory injuries in the workplace due to the use by gilstermary lee of a
bba flavor all bba and iff flavors meet the requirements of the u s food and
drug administration and are safe for handling and use by workers in food
manufacturing plants when used according to specified safety procedures based
on the preliminary report issued by the national institute for occupational
safety and health niosh it appears any injuries the plaintiffs may have
suffered are related to inadequate workplace conditions

   this case is in its preliminary stages the company does not expect this
litigation to have a material adverse effect on the companys financial
condition results of operations or liquidity

   over the past twenty years various federal and state authorities and
private parties have claimed that the company is a potentially responsible
party as a generator of waste materials for alleged pollution at a number of
waste sites operated by third parties located principally in new jersey and
seek to recover costs incurred and to be incurred to clean up the sites

   the waste site claims and suits usually involve million dollar amounts and
most of them are asserted against many potentially responsible parties
remedial activities typically consist of several phases carried out over a
period of years most site remedies begin with investigation and feasibility
studies followed by physical removal destruction treatment or containment of
contaminated soil and debris and sometimes by groundwater monitoring and
treatment to date the companys financial responsibility for some sites has
been settled through agreements granting the company in exchange for one or
more cash payments made or to be made either complete release of liability or
for certain sites release from further liability for early andor later
remediation phases subject to certain reopener clauses for laterdiscovered
conditions settlements in respect of some sites

                                      6

page

involve in part payment by the company and other parties of a percentage of
the sites future remediation costs over a period of years at present only
three sites remain the subject of significant unsettled claims

   the company believes that the amounts it has paid and anticipates paying in
the future for cleanup costs and damages at all sites are not and will not be
material to the companys financial condition results of operations or
liquidity because of the involvement of other large potentially responsible
parties at most sites because payment will be made over an extended time
period and because pursuant to an agreement reached in july 1994 with three of
the companys liability insurers defense costs and indemnity amounts payable
by the company in respect of the sites will be shared by the insurers up to an
agreed amount

   the present worldwide scope of the companys business is in part the
result of the combination in december 1958 of i the business conducted prior
to the combination primarily in the united states by the company under the
name van ameringenhaebler inc vah with ii the business conducted
prior to the combination primarily in europe by n v polak  schwarzs
essencefabrieken a dutch corporation p  s the p  s enterprise founded
in holland in 1889 was also engaged in the manufacture and sale of flavor and
fragrance products with operations in a number of countries where vah was not
an important factor

   in april 2000 the company acquired laboratoire monique remy lmr a
leader in the creation and commercialization of natural raw materials for
fragrances and flavors lmr operates stateoftheart laboratory and
manufacturing facilities in grasse france and an extraction plant in lozere
france

   on november 3 2000 pursuant to a cash tender offer by a whollyowned
subsidiary of the company for all of the outstanding shares of common stock of
bush boake allen inc bba the subsidiary acquired approximately 97 of
the outstanding shares of common stock of bba at 4850 per share bba was a
competitor of iff in the flavor and fragrance business with 1999 worldwide
sales of 499 million on november 9 2000 the subsidiary merged with and
into bba and bba became a whollyowned subsidiary of the company with each
remaining outstanding share of bba common stock converted into the right to
receive 4850 per share the company acquired all of the outstanding shares
of bba for approximately 970 million in cash including transaction costs

debt and bank borrowings

leadership in the flavors market where bba was an important factor to
strengthen the companys already leading global fragrance market position to
enhance the companys product line and customer base particularly in certain
emerging markets where bba previously had a significant presence and to
broaden and enhance the companys management pool in addition the company
concluded that the integration of the company and bba would achieve cost
savings and would allow the company to operate more efficiently and

market developments

   the demand for consumer products utilizing flavors and fragrances has been
stimulated and broadened by changing social habits resulting from various
factors such as increases in personal income employment of women teenage
population leisure time health concerns and urbanization and by the
continued growth in world population in the fragrance field these
developments have expanded the market for hair care candles and air care
products and deodorant and personal wash products with finer fragrance
quality as well as the market for colognes toilet waters mens toiletries
and other products beyond traditional luxury items such as perfumes in the
flavor field similar market characteristics have stimulated the demand for
products such as convenience foods soft drinks and lowcholesterol and low
fat food products that must conform to expected tastes new and improved
methods of packaging application and dispensing have been developed for many
consumer products which utilize some of the companys flavor or fragrance
products these developments have called for the creation by the company of
many new compounds and ingredients compatible with the newly introduced
materials and methods of application used in consumer end products

product development and research

   the development of new fragrance and flavor compounds is a complex artistic
and technical process calling upon the combined knowledge and talents of the
companys creative perfumers and flavorists and its application chemists and
research chemists through long experience the perfumers and flavorists
develop and refine their skill for creating fragrances or flavors best suited
to the market requirements of the customers products

   an important contribution to the creation of new fragrance and flavor
products is the development in the companys research laboratories of new
ingredients having fragrance or flavor value the principal functions of the
fragrance research program are to isolate and synthesize fragrance components
found in natural substances and through chemical synthesis in order to develop
new materials and better techniques for utilization of such materials the
principal functions of the flavor research program are to isolate and produce
natural flavor ingredients utilizing improved processes

   the principal executive offices of the company and its new york laboratory
facilities are located at 521 west 57th street new york city as a result of
the acquisition of bba the company is currently in the process of
consolidating or eliminating duplicate facilities the company believes that
the facilities that will remain following this consolidation process will meet

item 3 legal proceedings

   over the past twenty years various federal and state authorities and
private parties have claimed that the company is a potentially responsible
party as a generator of waste materials for alleged pollution at a number of
waste sites operated by third parties located principally in new jersey the
governmental authorities seek to recover costs incurred and to be incurred to
clean up the sites in one current private suit a waste sites former
owneroperator seeks contribution and indemnification from generators and
others for remedial action costs incurred and to be incurred at the site

   the waste site claims and suits usually involve million dollar amounts and
most of them are asserted against many potentially responsible parties
remedial activities typically consist of several phases carried out over a
period of years most site remedies begin with investigation and feasibility
studies followed by physical removal destruction treatment or containment
of contaminated soil and debris and sometimes by groundwater monitoring and
treatment to date the companys financial responsibility for some sites has
been settled through agreements granting the company in exchange for one or
more cash payments made or to be made either complete release of liability
or for certain sites release from further liability for early andor later
remediation phases subject to certain reopener clauses for later
discovered conditions settlements in respect of some

                                       6
page

sites involve in part payment by the company and other parties of a
percentage of the sites future remediation costs over a period of years at
present only four sites remain the subject of significant unsettled claims

   the company believes that the amounts it has paid and probably will have to
pay for cleanup costs and damages at all sites are and will not be material
to the companys financial condition results of operations or liquidity
because of the involvement of other large potentially responsible parties at
most sites because payment will be made over an extended time period and
because pursuant to an agreement reached in july 1994 with three of the
companys liability insurers defense costs and indemnity amounts payable by
the company in respect of the sites will be shared by the insurers up to an
agreed amount
