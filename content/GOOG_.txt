 item 1 business 

overview 

as our founders larry and sergey wrote in the original founders letter google is not a conventional company we do not intend to become one that unconventional spirit has been a driving force throughout our history inspiring us to tackle big problems and invest in moonshots like artificial intelligence ai research and quantum computing we continue this work under the leadership of sundar pichai who has served as ceo of google since 2015 and as ceo of alphabet since 2019 

alphabet is a collection of businesses — the largest of which is google we report google in two segments google services and google cloud we also report all nongoogle businesses collectively as other bets other bets include earlier stage technologies that are further afield from our core google business we take a longterm view and manage the portfolio of other bets with the discipline and rigor needed to deliver longterm returns alphabets structure is about helping each of our businesses prosper through strong leaders and independence 

access and technology for everyone 

the internet is one of the world’s most powerful equalizers it propels ideas people and businesses large and small our mission to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful is as relevant today as it was when we were founded in 1998 since then we have evolved from a company that helps people find answers to a company that also helps people get things done 

we are focused on building an even more helpful google for everyone and we aspire to give everyone the tools they need to increase their knowledge health happiness and success every year there are trillions of searches on google and 15 of the searches we see every day are new we continue to invest deeply in ai and other technologies to ensure the most helpful search experience possible youtube provides people with entertainment information and opportunities to learn something new and google assistant offers the best way to get things done seamlessly across different devices providing intelligent help throughout a persons day no matter where they are 

we are continually innovating and building new product features that will help our users partners customers and communities we have invested more than 100 billion in rd over the last five years in addition with the onset of 



the pandemic we have focused in particular on features that help people in their daily lives and that support businesses working to serve their customers for example we have added live busyness trends in google maps that help users instantly spot when a neighborhood or part of town is near or at its busiest we have also helped businesses navigate uncertainty during an uneven economic recovery and we have worked to address the complex challenge of distributing critical information about covid19 vaccines to billions of people around the world importantly we have made authoritative content a key focus area across both google search and youtube to help users find trusted public health information 

other bets also remain focused on innovation through technology that can positively affect peoples lives for instance waymo is working toward our goal of making transportation safer and easier for everyone and verily is developing tools and platforms to improve health outcomes 

moonshots 

many companies get comfortable doing what they have always done making only incremental changes this incrementalism leads to irrelevance over time especially in technology where change tends to be revolutionary not evolutionary people thought we were crazy when we acquired youtube and android and when we launched chrome but those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices and a safer popular browser we continue to look toward the future and to invest for the long term within each of our segments as we said in the original founders letter we will not shy away from highrisk highreward projects that we believe in as they are the key to our longterm success 

the power of ai 

across the company investments in ai and machine learning are increasingly driving many of our latest innovations and have enabled us to build products that are smarter and more helpful for example in may of 2021 we introduced multitask unified model — or mum — which has the potential to transform how google helps with complex tasks mum is trained across 75 different languages which means that it can learn from sources written in one language and help bring that information to people in another it is also multimodal so it understands information across text and images and in the future can expand to more modalities like video and audio we are currently experimenting with mum’s capabilities to make searching more natural and intuitive and even enable entirely new ways to search 

deepmind also made a significant aipowered breakthrough solving a 50yearold protein folding challenge which will help the world better understand one of life’s fundamental building blocks and will enable researchers to tackle new and difficult problems from fighting diseases to environmental sustainability deepmind has since shared its new alphafold protein structure database which doubled the number of highaccuracy human protein structures available to researchers 

google 

for reporting purposes google comprises two segments google services and google cloud 

google services 

serving our users 

we have always been a company committed to building helpful products that can improve the lives of millions of people our product innovations have made our services widely used and our brand one of the most recognized in the world google services core products and platforms include ads android chrome hardware gmail google drive google maps google photos google play search and youtube each with broad and growing adoption by users around the world 

our products and services have come a long way since the company was founded more than two decades ago rather than the ten blue links in our early search results users can now get direct answers to their questions using their computer mobile device or their own voice making it quicker easier and more natural to find what they are looking for 

this drive to make information more accessible and helpful has led us over the years to improve the discovery and creation of digital content both on the web and through platforms like google play and youtube with the continued adoption of mobile people are consuming more digital content by watching more videos playing more games listening to more music reading more books and using more apps than ever before working with content creators and partners we continue to build new ways for people around the world to find great digital content 

fueling all of these great digital experiences are extraordinary platforms and hardware that is why we continue to invest in platforms like our android mobile operating system chrome browser and chrome operating system as 



well as growing our family of hardware devices we see tremendous potential for devices to be helpful and make peoples lives easier by combining the best of our ai software and hardware this potential is reflected in our latest generation of hardware products such as pixel 5a 5g and pixel 6 phones the fitbit charge 5 chromecast with google tv and the new google nest cams and nest doorbell creating products that people rely on every day is a journey that we are investing in for the long run 

the key to building helpful products for users is our commitment to privacy security and user choice we protect user privacy and security with products that are secure by default and private by design and that keep users in control of their data our privacypreserving technologies safeguard individual privacy and enhance data protection as the internet evolves so does our approach to privacy and security we continue to enhance our antimalware features in chrome and drive improvements such as autodelete controls that automatically delete web and app searches after 18 months and we continue to keep users and their passwords safe through advances like our builtin password manager 

how we make money 

we have built worldclass advertising technologies for advertisers agencies and publishers to power their digital marketing businesses our advertising solutions help millions of companies grow their businesses through our wide range of products across devices and formats and we aim to ensure positive user experiences by serving the right ads at the right time and by building deep partnerships with brands and agencies 

google services generates revenues primarily by delivering both performance and brand advertising that appears on google search  other properties youtube and google network partners properties google network properties we continue to invest in both performance and brand advertising and seek to improve the measurability of advertising so advertisers understand the effectiveness of their campaigns 

• performance advertising creates and delivers relevant ads that users will click on leading to direct engagement with advertisers performance advertising lets our advertisers connect with users while driving measurable results our ads tools allow performance advertisers to create simple textbased ads 

• brand advertising helps enhance users awareness of and affinity for advertisers products and services through videos text images and other interactive ads that run across various devices we help brand advertisers deliver digital videos and other types of ads to specific audiences for their brandbuilding marketing campaigns 

we have allocated substantial resources to stopping bad advertising practices and protecting users on the web we focus on creating the best advertising experiences for our users and advertisers in many ways including filtering out invalid traffic removing billions of bad ads from our systems every year and closely monitoring the sites apps and videos where ads appear and blocklisting them when necessary to ensure that ads do not fund bad content 

we continue to look to the future and are making longterm investments that we expect to grow revenues beyond advertising including revenues from google play hardware and youtube nonadvertising 

• google play generates revenues from sales of apps and inapp purchases and digital content sold in the google play store 

• hardware generates revenues from sales of fitbit wearable devices google nest home products pixel phones and other devices 

• youtube nonadvertising generates revenues from youtube premium and youtube tv subscriptions and other services 

google cloud 

google was a company built in the cloud we continue to invest in infrastructure security data management analytics and ai we see significant opportunity in helping businesses utilize these strengths with features like data migration modern development environments and machine learning tools to provide enterpriseready cloud services including google cloud platform and google workspace google cloud platform enables developers to build test and deploy applications on its highly scalable and reliable infrastructure google workspace collaboration tools — which include apps like gmail docs drive calendar meet and more — are designed with realtime collaboration and machine intelligence to help people work smarter because more and more of today’s digital experiences are being built in the cloud google cloud products help businesses of all sizes take advantage of the latest technology advances to operate more efficiently 

• google cloud platform generates revenues from infrastructure platform and other services 



• google workspace generates revenues from cloudbased collaboration tools for enterprises such as gmail docs drive calendar and meet 

our cloud services are generally provided on either a consumption or subscription basis and may have contract terms longer than a year 

other bets 

across alphabet we are also using technology to try to solve big problems that affect a wide variety of industries alphabet’s investment in the portfolio of other bets includes emerging businesses at various stages of development ranging from those in the rd phase to those that are in the beginning stages of commercialization and our goal is for them to become thriving successful businesses in the medium to long term while these earlystage businesses naturally come with considerable uncertainty some of them are already generating revenue and making important strides in their industries revenues from other bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services 

other bets operate as independent companies and some of them have their own boards with independent members and outside investors we are investing in the portfolio of other bets and being very deliberate about the focus scale and pace of investments 

competition 

our business is characterized by rapid change as well as new and disruptive technologies we face formidable competition in every aspect of our business including from 

• general purpose search engines and information services such as baidu microsofts bing naver seznam yahoo and yandex 

• vertical search engines and ecommerce providers such as amazon and ebay ecommerce bookings kayak travel queries microsofts linkedin job queries and webmd health queries some users will navigate directly to such content websites and apps rather than go through google 

• social networks offered by bytedance meta snap and twitter some users increasingly rely on social networks for product or service referrals rather than seeking information through traditional search engines 

• other online advertising platforms and networks such as amazon appnexus criteo and meta that compete for advertisers that use google ads our primary auctionbased advertising platform 

• other forms of advertising such as billboards magazines newspapers radio and television our advertisers typically advertise in multiple media both online and offline 

• companies that design manufacture and market consumer hardware products including businesses that have developed proprietary platforms such as amazon apple and microsoft 

• digital assistant providers such as amazon and apple 

• providers of enterprise cloud services such as alibaba amazon microsoft and salesforce 

• providers of digital video services such as amazon apple att bytedance disney hulu meta and netflix 

• other digital content and application platform providers such as amazon and apple 

• providers of workspace connectivity and productivity products such as meta microsoft salesforce and zoom 

competing successfully depends heavily on our ability to develop and distribute innovative products and technologies to the marketplace across our businesses specifically for advertising competing successfully depends on attracting and retaining 

• users for whom other products and services are literally one click away largely on the basis of the relevance of our advertising as well as the general usefulness security and availability of our products and services 

• advertisers primarily based on our ability to generate sales leads and ultimately customers and to deliver their advertisements in an efficient and effective manner across a variety of distribution channels and 

• content providers primarily based on the quality of our advertiser base our ability to help these partners generate revenues from advertising and the terms of our agreements with them

ongoing commitment to sustainability 

we believe that every business has the opportunity and obligation to protect our planet sustainability is one of our core values at google and we strive to build sustainability into everything we do we have been a leader on sustainability and climate change since google’s founding over 20 years ago these are some of our key achievements over the past two decades 

• in 2007 we became the first major company to be carbon neutral for our operations 

• in 2017 we became the first major company to match 100 of our annual electricity use with renewable energy which we have achieved for four consecutive years 

• in 2020 we issued 575 billion in sustainability bonds—the largest sustainability or green bond issuance by any company in history at the time the net proceeds from the issuance are used to fund environmentally and socially responsible projects in the following eight areas energy efficiency clean energy green buildings clean transportation circular economy and design affordable housing commitment to racial equity and support for small businesses and covid19 crisis response as of december 31 2020 we have allocated 347 billion of the net proceeds as outlined in our sustainability bond impact report published in 2021 

• also in 2020 we compensated for our legacy carbon footprint making google the first major company to be carbon neutral for its entire operating history 

our sustainability strategy is focused on three key pillars accelerating the transition to carbonfree energy and a circular economy empowering everyone with technology and benefiting the people and places where we operate 

to accelerate the transition to a carbonfree economy in 2020 we launched our third decade of climate action and we are now working toward a new set of ambitious goals by 2030 we aim to 

• achieve netzero emissions across all of our operations and value chain 

• become the first major company to run on carbonfree energy 24 hours a day seven days a week 365 days a year 

• enable 5 gigawatts of new carbonfree energy through investments in our key manufacturing regions and 

• help more than 500 cities and local governments reduce an aggregate of 1 gigaton of carbon emissions annually 

to accelerate the transition to a circular economy we are working to maximize the reuse of finite resources across our operations products and supply chains and to enable others to do the same we are also working to empower everyone with technology by committing to help 1 billion people make more sustainable choices by the end of 2022 through our core products 

to benefit the people and places where we operate we have set goals to replenish more water than we consume by 2030 and to support water security in communities where we operate we will focus on three areas enhancing our stewardship of water resources across google office campuses and data centers replenishing our water use and improving watershed health and ecosystems in waterstressed communities and sharing technology and tools that help everyone predict prevent and recover from water stress 

we remain steadfast in our commitment to sustainability and we will continue to lead and encourage others to join us in improving the health of our planet we are proud of what we have achieved so far and we are energized to help move the world closer to a more sustainable and carbonfree future for all

government regulation 

we are subject to numerous united states us federal state and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subject matters like other companies in the technology industry we face heightened scrutiny from both us and foreign governments with respect to our compliance with laws and regulations many of these laws and regulations are evolving and their applicability and scope as interpreted by the courts remain uncertain 

our compliance with these laws and regulations may be onerous and could individually or in the aggregate increase our cost of doing business make our products and services less useful limit our ability to pursue certain business models cause us to change our business practices affect our competitive position relative to our peers andor otherwise have an adverse effect on our business reputation financial condition and operating results

 item 1a risk factors 

our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties including but not limited to those described below which could harm our business reputation financial condition and operating results and affect the trading price of our class a and class c stock 

risks specific to our company 

we generate a significant portion of our revenues from advertising and reduced spending by advertisers a loss of partners or new and existing technologies that block ads online andor affect our ability to customize ads could harm our business 

we generated more than 80 of total revenues from the display of ads online in 2021 many of our advertisers companies that distribute our products and services digital publishers and content providers can terminate their contracts with us at any time these partners may not continue to do business with us if we do not create more value such as increased numbers of users or customers new sales leads increased brand awareness or more effective monetization than their available alternatives changes to our advertising policies and data privacy practices as well as changes to other companies’ advertising andor data privacy practices have in the past and may in the future affect the advertising that we are able to provide which could harm our business in addition technologies have been developed that make customized ads more difficult or that block the display of ads altogether and some providers of online services have integrated technologies that could potentially impair the availability and functionality of thirdparty digital advertising failing to provide superior value or deliver advertisements effectively and competitively could harm our reputation financial condition and operating results 

in addition expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical reflecting overall economic conditions and budgeting and buying patterns adverse macroeconomic conditions have affected and may in the future affect the demand for advertising resulting in fluctuations in the amounts our advertisers spend on advertising which could harm our financial condition and operating results 

we face intense competition if we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that are useful to users customers and other partners we may not remain competitive which could harm our business and operating results 

our business environment is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive our businesses face changing technologies shifting user needs and frequent introductions of rival products and services to compete successfully we must accurately anticipate technology developments and deliver innovative relevant and useful products services and technologies in a timely manner as our businesses evolve the competitive pressure to innovate will encompass a wider range of products and services we must continue to invest significant resources in rd including through acquisitions in order to enhance our technology and new and existing products and services 

we have many competitors in different industries our current and potential domestic and international competitors range from large and established companies to emerging startups some competitors have longer operating histories and well established relationships in various sectors they can use their experience and resources in ways that could affect our competitive position including by making acquisitions continuing to invest heavily in rd and in talent aggressively initiating intellectual property claims whether or not meritorious and continuing to compete aggressively for users advertisers customers and content providers further discrepancies in enforcement of existing laws may enable our lesser known competitors to aggressively interpret those laws without commensurate scrutiny thereby affording them competitive advantages our competitors may also be able to innovate and provide products and services faster than we can or may foresee the need for products and services before us 

our operating results may also suffer if our products and services are not responsive to the needs of our users advertisers publishers customers and content providers as technologies continue to develop our competitors may be able to offer experiences that are or that are seen to be substantially similar to or better than ours this may force us to compete in different ways and expend significant resources in order to remain competitive if our competitors are more successful than we are in providing compelling products and services or in attracting and retaining users advertisers publishers customers and content providers our operating results could be harmed 

our ongoing investment in new businesses products services and technologies is inherently risky and could divert management attention and harm our financial condition and operating results 



we have invested and expect to continue to invest in new businesses products services and technologies the investments that we are making across google services google cloud and other bets reflect our ongoing efforts to innovate and provide products and services that are useful to users advertisers publishers customers and content providers our investments in google services google cloud and other bets span a wide range of industries beyond online advertising such investments ultimately may not be commercially viable or may not result in an adequate return of capital and in pursuing new strategies we may incur unanticipated liabilities these endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties including diversion of resources and management attention from current operations and with respect to other bets the use of alternative investment governance or compensation structures that may fail to adequately align incentives across the company or otherwise accomplish their objectives 

within google services we continue to invest heavily in hardware including our smartphones home devices and wearables which is a highly competitive market with frequent introduction of new products and services rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors short product life cycles evolving industry standards continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics and price and feature sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses there can be no assurance we will be able to provide hardware that competes effectively 

within google cloud we devote significant resources to develop and deploy our enterpriseready cloud services including google cloud platform and google workspace we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services and hire talent particularly to support and scale our salesforce at the same time our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloudbased services pricing and delivery models are competitive and evolving and we may not attain sufficient scale and profitability to achieve our business objectives 

within other bets we are investing significantly in the areas of health life sciences and transportation among others these investment areas face intense competition from large experienced and wellfunded competitors and our offerings may not be able to compete effectively or to operate at sufficient levels of profitability 

in addition new and evolving products and services including those that use ai and machine learning raise ethical technological legal regulatory and other challenges which may negatively affect our brands and demand for our products and services because all of these new ventures are inherently risky no assurance can be given that such strategies and offerings will be successful and will not harm our reputation financial condition and operating results 

our revenue growth rate could decline over time and we anticipate downward pressure on our operating margin in the future 

our revenue growth rate could decline over time as a result of a number of factors including increasing competition changes in device mix geographic mix ongoing product and policy changes product mix and property mix and an increasing competition for advertising may also affect our advertising revenue growth rate we may also experience a decline in our revenue growth rate as our revenues increase to higher levels if there is a decrease in the rate of adoption of our products services and technologies or due to deceleration or decline in demand for devices used to access our services among other factors 

in addition we may also experience downward pressure on our operating margin resulting from a variety of factors such as the continued expansion of our business into new fields including products and services such as hardware google cloud and subscription products as well as significant investments in other bets all of which may have margins lower than those we generate from advertising we may also experience downward pressure on our operating margins from increasing regulations increasing competition and increased costs for many aspects of our business due to these factors and the evolving nature of our business our historical revenue growth rate and historical operating margin may not be indicative of our future performance for additional information see trends in our business and financial effect in part ii item 7 of this annual report on form 10k 

our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products services and brands as well as affect our ability to compete 

our patents trademarks trade secrets copyrights and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us various events outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights as well as to our products services and technologies for example effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are distributed or made available through the internet also the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective although we seek to obtain patent protection for our innovations it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innovations moreover we may not have adequate patent or copyright protection for certain innovations that later turn out to be important there is always the possibility that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceable 



we also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets the secrecy of such trade secrets and other sensitive information could be compromised which could cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting from these trade secrets we also face risks associated with our trademarks for example there is a risk that the word “google” could become so commonly used that it becomes synonymous with the word “search” some courts have ruled that google is a protectable trademark but it is possible that other courts particularly those outside of the us may reach a different determination if this happens we could lose protection for this trademark which could result in other people using the word “google” to refer to their own products thus diminishing our brand 

any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our ability to compete also protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming any increase in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results 

our business depends on strong brands and failing to maintain and enhance our brands would hurt our ability to expand our base of users advertisers customers content providers and other partners 

our strong brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business maintaining and enhancing the brands within google services google cloud and other bets increases our ability to enter new categories and launch new and innovative products and services that better serve the needs of our users advertisers customers content providers and other partners our brands have been and may in the future be negatively affected by a number of factors including among others reputational issues thirdparty content shared on our platforms data privacy and security issues and developments and product or technical performance failures for example if we fail to respond appropriately to the sharing of misinformation or objectionable content on our services andor products or objectionable practices by advertisers or otherwise to adequately address user concerns our users may lose confidence in our brands 

furthermore failure to maintain and enhance equity in our brands may harm our business financial condition and operating results our success will depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to provide highquality trustworthy innovative products and services that are truly useful and play a valuable role in a range of settings 

we face a number of manufacturing and supply chain risks that could harm our financial condition operating results and prospects 

we face a number of risks related to manufacturing and supply chain management which could affect our ability to supply both our products and our internetbased services 

we rely on other companies to manufacture many of our finished products to design certain of our components and parts to participate in the distribution of our products and services and to design manufacture or assemble certain components and parts in our technical infrastructure our business could be negatively affected if we are not able to engage these companies with the necessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms or if those we engage fail to meet their obligations whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons or make adverse changes in the pricing or other material terms of our arrangements with them 

we have experienced andor may in the future experience supply shortages andor price increases that could negatively affect our operations driven by raw material component or part availability manufacturing capacity labor shortages industry allocations logistics capacity tariffs trade disputes and barriers natural disasters or pandemics the effects of climate change such as sea level rise drought flooding heat waves wildfires and resultant air quality effects and power shutoffs associated with wildfire prevention and increased storm severity and significant changes in the financial or business condition of our suppliers in addition some of the components we use in our technical infrastructure and products are available from only one or limited sources and we may not be able to find replacement vendors on favorable terms in the event of a supply chain disruption in addition a significant supply interruption that affects us or our vendors could delay critical data center upgrades or expansions and delay product availability 

we may enter into longterm contracts for materials and products that commit us to significant terms and conditions we may be liable for materials and products that are not consumed due to market acceptance technological change obsolescences quality product recalls and warranty issues for instance because certain of our hardware supply contracts have volumebased pricing or minimum purchase requirements if the volume of our hardware sales decreases or does not reach projected targets we could face increased materials and manufacturing costs or other financial liabilities that could make our products more costly per unit to manufacture and negatively affect our financial results furthermore certain of our competitors may negotiate more favorable contractual terms based on volume and other commitments that may provide them with competitive advantages and may affect our supply 



our products and services have had and in the future may have quality issues resulting from design manufacturing or operations sometimes these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other manufacturers or suppliers if the quality of our products and services does not meet expectations or our products or services are defective it could harm our reputation financial condition and operating results 

we require our suppliers and business partners to comply with laws and where applicable our company policies such as the google supplier code of conduct regarding workplace and employment practices data security environmental compliance and intellectual property licensing but we do not control them or their practices violations of law or unethical business practices could result in supply chain disruptions canceled orders harm to key relationships and damage to our reputation their failure to procure necessary license rights to intellectual property could affect our ability to sell our products or services and expose us to litigation or financial claims 

interruption to interference with or failure of our complex information technology and communications systems could hurt our ability to effectively provide our products and services which could harm our reputation financial condition and operating results in addition problems with the design or implementation of our new global enterprise resource planning system could harm our business and operations 

the availability of our products and services and fulfillment of our customer contracts depend on the continuing operation of our information technology and communications systems our systems are vulnerable to damage interference or interruption from modifications or upgrades terrorist attacks natural disasters or pandemics the effects of climate change such as sea level rise drought flooding heat waves wildfires and resultant air quality effects and power shutoffs associated with wildfire prevention and increased storm severity power loss telecommunications failures computer viruses ransomware attacks computer denial of service attacks phishing schemes or other attempts to harm or access our systems some of our data centers are located in areas with a high risk of major earthquakes or other natural disasters our data centers are also subject to breakins sabotage and intentional acts of vandalism and in some cases to potential disruptions resulting from problems experienced by facility operators some of our systems are not fully redundant and disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities the occurrence of a natural disaster or pandemic closure of a facility or other unanticipated problems affecting our data centers could result in lengthy interruptions in our service in addition our products and services are highly technical and complex and have contained in the past and may contain in the future errors or vulnerabilities which could result in interruptions in or failure of our services or systems 

in addition we rely extensively on information systems and technology to manage our business and summarize operating results we are in the process of a multiyear implementation of a new erp system which is designed to accurately maintain our financial records enhance the flow of financial information improve data management and provide timely information to our management team as the phased implementation continues we may experience delays increased costs and other difficulties failure to successfully design and implement the erp system as planned could harm our business financial condition and operating results additionally if we do not effectively implement the erp system as planned or the erp system does not operate as intended the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could be negatively affected 

our international operations expose us to additional risks that could harm our business our financial condition and operating results 

our international operations are significant to our revenues and net income and we plan to continue to grow internationally international revenues accounted for approximately 54 of our consolidated revenues in 2021 in addition to risks described elsewhere in this section our international operations expose us to other risks including the following 

• restrictions on foreign ownership and investments and stringent foreign exchange controls that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the us 

• import and export requirements tariffs and other market access barriers that may prevent or impede us from offering products or providing services to a particular market or that could limit our ability to source assemblies and finished products from a particular market and may increase our operating costs 

• longer payment cycles in some countries increased credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud 

• an evolving foreign policy landscape that may adversely affect our revenues and could subject us to new regulatory costs and challenges including the transfer of personal data between the eu and the united kingdom and new customer requirements in addition to other adverse effects that we are unable to effectively anticipate 



• anticorruption laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and other local laws prohibiting certain payments to government officials violations of which could result in civil and criminal penalties 

• uncertainty regarding liability for services and content including uncertainty as a result of local laws and lack of legal precedent and 

• different employeeemployer relationships existence of works councils and labor unions and other challenges caused by distance language and cultural differences making it harder to do business in certain jurisdictions 

because we conduct business in currencies other than us dollars but report our financial results in us dollars we have faced and will continue to face exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our revenues and earnings hedging programs are also inherently risky and could expose us to additional risks that could harm our financial condition and operating results 

risks related to our industry 

people access the internet through a variety of platforms and devices that continue to evolve with the advancement of technology and user preferences if manufacturers and users do not widely adopt versions of our products and services developed for these interfaces our business could be harmed 

people access the internet through a growing variety of devices such as desktop computers mobile phones smartphones laptops and tablets video game consoles voiceactivated speakers wearables automobiles and televisionstreaming devices our products and services may be less popular on some interfaces each manufacturer or distributor may establish unique technical standards for its devices and our products and services may not be available or may only be available with limited functionality for our users or our advertisers on these devices as a result some manufacturers may also elect not to include our products on their devices in addition search queries are increasingly being undertaken via voiceactivated speakers apps social media or other platforms which could harm our business it is hard to predict the challenges we may encounter in adapting our products and services and developing competitive new products and services we expect to continue to devote significant resources to creating and supporting products and services across multiple platforms and devices failing to attract and retain a substantial number of new device manufacturers suppliers distributors developers and users or failing to develop products and technologies that work well on new devices and platforms could harm our business financial condition and operating results and ability to capture future business opportunities 

data privacy and security concerns relating to our technology and our practices could damage our reputation cause us to incur significant liability and deter current and potential users or customers from using our products and services software bugs or defects security breaches and attacks on our systems could result in the improper disclosure and use of user data and interference with our users’ and customers’ ability to use our products and services harming our business operations and reputation 

concerns about including the adequacy of our practices with regard to the collection use governance disclosure or security of personal information or other dataprivacyrelated matters even if unfounded could harm our reputation financial condition and operating results our policies and practices may change over time as expectations and regulations regarding privacy and data change 

our products and services involve the storage handling and transmission of proprietary and other sensitive information software bugs theft misuse defects vulnerabilities in our products and services and security breaches expose us to a risk of loss or improper use and disclosure of such information which could result in litigation and other potential liability including regulatory fines and penalties as well as reputational harm additionally our products incorporate highly technical and complex technologies and thus our technologies and software have contained and are likely in the future to contain undetected errors bugs or vulnerabilities we have in the past discovered and may in the future discover some errors in our software code only after we have released the code systems and control failures security breaches failure to comply with our privacy policies andor inadvertent disclosure of user data could result in government and legal exposure seriously harm our reputation brand and business and impair our ability to attract and retain users or customers such incidents have occurred in the past and may continue to occur due to the scale and nature of our products and services while there is no guarantee that such incidents will not cause significant damage we expect to continue to expend significant resources to maintain security protections that limit the effect of bugs theft misuse and security vulnerabilities or breaches 

we experience cyber attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to our systems on a regular basis cyber attacks continue to evolve in sophistication and volume and inherently may be difficult to detect for long periods of time we have seen and will continue to see industrywide vulnerabilities such as the log4j vulnerability reported in december 2021 which could affect our or other parties’ systems we expect to continue to experience such 



incidents or vulnerabilities in the future our efforts to address undesirable activity on our platform may also increase the risk of retaliatory attack we may experience future security issues whether due to employee error or malfeasance or system errors or vulnerabilities in our or other parties’ systems while we may not determine some of these issues to be material at the time they occur and may remedy them quickly there is no guarantee that these issues will not ultimately result in significant legal financial and reputational harm including government inquiries and enforcement actions litigation and negative publicity because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to disable or degrade service provided by or otherwise sabotage systems change frequently and often are recognized only after being launched against a target even taking all reasonable precautions including those required by law we have been unable in the past and may continue to be unable to anticipate or detect attacks or vulnerabilities or implement adequate preventative measures 

further if any partners with whom we share user or other customer information fail to implement adequate datasecurity practices or fail to comply with our terms and policies or otherwise suffer a network or other security breach our users’ information may be improperly accessed used or disclosed if an actual or perceived breach of our or our business partners’ or service providers’ security occurs the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures would be harmed we could lose users and customers our trade secrets or those of our business partners may be compromised and we may be exposed to significant legal and financial risks including legal claims which may include classaction litigation and regulatory action fines and penalties any of the foregoing consequences could have a material and adverse effect on our business reputation and results of operations 

while we have dedicated significant resources to privacy and security incident response capabilities including dedicated worldwide incident response teams our response process particularly during times of a natural disaster or pandemic may not be adequate may fail to accurately assess the severity of an incident may not be fast enough to prevent or limit harm or may fail to sufficiently remediate an incident as a result we may suffer significant legal reputational or financial exposure which could harm our business financial condition and operating results 

for additional information see also our risk factor on privacy and data protection regulations under ‘risks related to laws and regulations’ below 

our ongoing investments in safety security and content review will likely continue to identify abuse of our platforms and misuse of user data 

in addition to our efforts to prevent and mitigate cyber attacks we are making significant investments in safety security and review efforts to combat misuse of our services and unauthorized access to user data by third parties including investigation and review of platform applications that could access the information of users of our services as a result of these efforts we have in the past discovered and may in the future discover incidents of unnecessary access to or misuse of user data or other undesirable activity by third parties however we may not have discovered and may in the future not discover all such incidents or activity whether as a result of our data limitations including our lack of visibility over our encrypted services the scale of activity on our platform or other factors including factors outside of our control such as a natural disaster or pandemic and we may learn of such incidents or activity via third parties such incidents and activities may include the use of user data or our systems in a manner inconsistent with our terms contracts or policies the existence of false or undesirable user accounts election interference improper ad purchases activities that threaten people’s safety on or offline or instances of spamming scraping or spreading disinformation while we may not determine some of these incidents to be material at the time they occurred and we may remedy them quickly there is no guarantee that these issues will not ultimately result in significant legal financial and reputational harm including government inquiries and enforcement actions litigation and negative publicity 

we may also be unsuccessful in our efforts to enforce our policies or otherwise prevent or remediate any such incidents any of the foregoing developments may negatively affect user trust and engagement harm our reputation and brands require us to change our business practices in ways that harm our business operations and adversely affect our business and financial results any such developments may also subject us to additional litigation and regulatory inquiries which could result in monetary penalties and damages divert management’s time and attention and lead to enhanced regulatory oversight 

problematic content on our platforms including lowquality usergenerated content web spam content farms and other violations of our guidelines could affect the quality of our services which could damage our reputation and deter our current and potential users from using our products and services 

we like others in the industry face violations of our content guidelines across our platforms including sophisticated attempts by bad actors to manipulate our hosting and advertising systems to fraudulently generate revenues or to otherwise generate traffic that does not represent genuine user interest or intent while we invest significantly in efforts to promote highquality and relevant results and to detect and prevent lowquality content and 



invalid traffic we have been unable and may continue to be unable to adequately detect and prevent all such abuses or promote uniformly highquality content 

many websites violate or attempt to violate our guidelines including by seeking to inappropriately rank higher in search results than our search engines assessment of their relevance and utility would rank them such efforts have affected and may continue to affect the quality of content on our platforms and lead them to display false misleading or undesirable content although englishlanguage web spam in our search results has been reduced and web spam in most other languages is limited we expect web spammers will continue to seek inappropriate ways to improve their rankings we continuously combat web spam in our search results including through indexing technology that makes it harder for spamlike less useful web content to rank highly we also continue to invest in and deploy proprietary technology to detect and prevent web spam on our platforms we also face other challenges from lowquality and irrelevant content websites including content farms which are websites that generate large quantities of lowquality content to help them improve their search rankings we are continually launching algorithmic changes designed to detect and prevent abuse from lowquality websites we also face other challenges on our platforms including violations of our content guidelines involving incidents such as attempted election interference activities that threaten the safety andor wellbeing of our users on or offline and the spreading of misinformation or disinformation 

if we fail to either detect and prevent an increase in problematic content or effectively promote highquality content it could hurt our reputation for delivering relevant information or reduce use of our platforms harming our financial condition or operating results it may also subject us to litigation and regulatory action which could result in monetary penalties and damages and divert management’s time and attention 

our business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the internet by us and our users internet access providers may be able to restrict block degrade or charge for access to certain of our products and services which could lead to additional expenses and the loss of users and advertisers 

our products and services depend on the ability of our users to access the internet and certain of our products require significant bandwidth to work effectively currently this access is provided by companies that have significant market power in the broadband and internet access marketplace including incumbent telephone companies cable companies mobile communications companies and governmentowned service providers some of these providers have taken or have stated that they may take measures that could degrade disrupt or increase the cost of user access to certain of our products by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate our offerings by charging increased fees to us or our users to provide our offerings or by providing our competitors preferential access some jurisdictions have adopted regulations prohibiting certain forms of discrimination by internet access providers however substantial uncertainty exists in the us and elsewhere regarding such protections for example in 2018 the us federal communications commission repealed net neutrality rules which could permit internet access providers to restrict block degrade or charge for access to certain of our products and services in addition in some jurisdictions our products and services have been subject to governmentinitiated restrictions or blockages these could harm existing key relationships including with our users customers advertisers andor content providers and impair our ability to attract new ones damage our reputation and increase costs thereby negatively affecting our business 

risks related to laws regulations and policies 

we face increased regulatory scrutiny as well as changes in regulatory conditions laws and policies governing a wide range of topics that may negatively affect our business 

we and other companies in the technology industry face increased regulatory scrutiny enforcement action and other proceedings for instance the us department of justice joined by a number of state attorneys general filed an antitrust complaint against google on october 20 2020 alleging that google violated us antitrust laws relating to search and search advertising similarly on december 16 2020 a number of state attorneys general filed an antitrust complaint against google in the us district court for the eastern district of texas alleging that google violated us antitrust laws as well as state deceptive trade laws relating to its advertising technology various other regulatory agencies in the us and around the world including competition enforcers consumer protection agencies data protection authorities grand juries interagency consultative groups and a range of other governmental bodies have and continue to review and in some cases challenge our products and services and their compliance with laws and regulations around the world we continue to cooperate with these investigations and defend litigation where appropriate various laws regulations investigations enforcement lawsuits and regulatory actions have in the past and may in the future result in substantial fines and penalties injunctive relief ongoing auditing and monitoring obligations changes to our products and services alterations to our business models and operations and collateral litigation all of which could harm our business reputation financial condition and operating results 



changes in international and local social political economic tax and regulatory conditions or in laws and policies have in the past and may in the future increase our cost of doing business and limit our ability to pursue certain business models offer products or services in certain jurisdictions or cause us to change our business practices we have in the past had to alter or stop offering certain products and services as a result of laws or regulations that made them unfeasible and new laws or regulations could result in our having to terminate alter or withdraw products and services in the future additional costs of doing business new limitations or changes to our business model or practices could harm our business reputation financial condition and operating results 

we are subject to regulations laws and policies that govern a wide range of topics including those related to matters beyond our core products and services for instance new regulations laws policies and international accords relating to environmental and social matters including sustainability climate change human capital and diversity are being developed and formalized in europe the us and elsewhere which may entail specific targetdriven frameworks andor disclosure requirements we have implemented robust environmental and social programs adopted reporting frameworks and principles and announced a number of goals and initiatives including those related to environmental sustainability and diversity the implementation of these goals and initiatives may require considerable investments and our goals with all of their contingencies dependencies and in certain cases reliance on thirdparty verification andor performance are complex and ambitious and we cannot guarantee that we will achieve them 

additionally there can be no assurance that our current programs reporting frameworks and principles will be in compliance with any new environmental and social laws and regulations that may be promulgated in the us and elsewhere and the costs of changing any of our current practices to comply with any new legal and regulatory requirements in the us and elsewhere may be substantial furthermore industry and market practices may further develop to become even more robust than what is required under any new laws and regulations and we may have to expend significant efforts and resources to keep up with market trends and stay competitive among our peers 

a variety of new and existing laws andor interpretations could harm our business 

we are subject to numerous us and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subject matters new laws and regulations or new interpretations or applications of existing laws and regulations in a manner inconsistent with our practices have made and may continue to make our products and services less useful limit our ability to pursue certain business models or offer certain products and services in certain jurisdictions require us to incur substantial costs expose us to civil or criminal liability or cause us to change our business practices these laws and regulations are evolving and involve matters central to our business including among others 

• laws and regulations around the world focused on large technology platforms including the digital markets act in the european union and proposed antitrust legislation on selfpreferencing and mergers and acquisitions in the us which may limit certain business practices and in some cases create the risk of significant penalties 

• privacy laws such as the gdpr ccpa cpra virginia cdpa and colopa as defined and discussed further below 

• data protection laws passed by many states within the us and by certain countries regarding notification to data subjects andor regulators when there is a security breach of personal data 

• consumer protection laws including eu’s new deal for consumers which could result in monetary penalties and create a range of new compliance obligations 

• new laws further restricting the collection processing andor sharing of advertisingrelated data copyright or similar laws around the world including the eu directive on copyright in the digital single market eucd and eu member state transpositions these and similar laws that have been adopted or proposed introduce new licensing regimes that could affect our ability to operate the eucd and similar laws could also increase the liability of some contentsharing services with respect to content uploaded by their users some of these laws as well as followon administrative or judicial actions have also created or may create a new property right in news publications that limits the ability of some online services to link to interact with or present such content they may also require individual or collective compensation negotiations with news agencies and publishers for the use of such content which may result in payment obligations that significantly exceed the value that such content provides to google and its users potentially harming our services commercial operations and business results 

• data localization laws which generally mandate that certain types of data collected in a particular country be stored andor processed within that country 



• various us and international laws that govern the distribution of certain materials to children and regulate the ability of online services to collect information from minors including the children’s online privacy protection act of 1998 and the united kingdom’s ageappropriate design code 

• various laws with regard to content moderation and removal and related disclosure obligations such as the network enforcement act in germany and the european unions pending digital services act which may affect our businesses and operations and may subject us to significant fines if such laws are interpreted and applied in a manner inconsistent with our practices or when we may not proactively discover such content due to the scale of thirdparty content and the limitations of existing technologies other countries including singapore australia and the united kingdom have implemented or are considering similar legislation imposing penalties for failure to remove certain types of content 

• various legislative litigation and regulatory activity regarding our google play billing policies and business model which could result in monetary penalties damages andor prohibition 

• various legislative and regulatory activity requiring disclosure of information about the operation of our services and algorithms which may make it easier for websites to artificially promote lowquality deceptive or harmful content on services like google search and youtube potentially harming the quality of our services 

in addition the applicability and scope of these laws as interpreted by the courts remain uncertain and could harm our business for example 

• we rely on statutory safe harbors as set forth in the digital millennium copyright act and section 230 of the communications decency act in the us and the ecommerce directive in europe against liability for various linking caching and hosting activities any legislation or court rulings affecting these safe harbors may adversely affect us there are legislative proposals in both the us and eu that could reduce our safe harbor protection 

• court decisions such as the judgment of the court of justice of the european union cjeu on may 13 2014 on the ‘right to be forgotten’ which allows individuals to demand that google remove search results about them in certain instances may limit the content we can show to our users and impose significant operational burdens 

the introduction of new businesses products services and technologies our activities in certain jurisdictions or other actions we take have subjected us and will likely continue to subject us to additional laws and regulations our investment in a variety of new fields such as healthcare and payment services has expanded and will continue to expand the scope of regulations that apply to our business the costs of compliance with these laws and regulations are high and are likely to increase in the future any failure on our part to comply with laws and regulations can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort and may subject us to significant liabilities and other penalties 

we are subject to claims suits government investigations other proceedings and consent decrees that may harm our business financial condition and operating results 

we are subject to claims suits government investigations other proceedings and consent decrees involving competition intellectual property data privacy and security consumer protection tax labor and employment commercial disputes content generated by our users goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms and other matters due to our manufacturing and sale of an expanded suite of products and services including hardware as well as google cloud offerings we also are subject to a variety of claims including product warranty product liability and consumer protection claims related to product defects among other litigation we may also be subject to claims involving health and safety hazardous materials usage other environmental effects or service disruptions or failures 

any of these types of legal proceedings can have an adverse effect on us because of legal costs diversion of management resources negative publicity and other factors determining reserves for our pending litigation is a complex factintensive process that requires significant judgment the resolution of one or more such proceedings has resulted in and may in the future result in additional substantial fines penalties injunctions and other sanctions that could harm our business financial condition and operating results 

we may be subject to legal liability associated with providing online services or content 

our products and services let users exchange information advertise products and services conduct business and engage in various online activities we also place advertisements displayed on other companies’ websites and we offer thirdparty products services andor content the law relating to the liability of online service providers for others’ activities on their services is still somewhat unsettled around the world claims have been brought against us and we 



expect will continue to be brought against us for defamation negligence breaches of contract copyright and trademark infringement unfair competition unlawful activity torts fraud or other legal theories based on the nature and content of information available on or via our services 

we may be subject to claims by virtue of our involvement in hosting transmitting marketing branding or providing access to content created by third parties defense of such actions could be costly and involve significant time and attention of our management and other resources may result in monetary liabilities or penalties and may require us to change our business in an adverse manner 

privacy and data protection regulations are complex and rapidly evolving areas any failure or alleged failure to comply with these laws could harm our business reputation financial condition and operating results 

authorities around the world have adopted and are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection and limits on encryption of user data adverse legal rulings legislation or regulation have resulted in and may continue to result in fines and orders requiring that we change our data practices which could have an adverse effect on our ability to provide services harming our business operations complying with these evolving laws could result in substantial costs and harm the quality of our products and services negatively affecting our business and may be particularly challenging during certain times such as a natural disaster or pandemic amongst others we are and will be subject to the following laws and regulations 

• the general data protection regulation gdpr which applies to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the eu or related to products and services that we offer to eu users or customers or the monitoring of their behavior in the eu ensuring compliance with the range of obligations created by the gdpr is an ongoing commitment that involves substantial costs despite our efforts governmental authorities or others have asserted and may continue to assert that our business practices fail to comply with its requirements if our operations are found to violate the gdpr requirements we may incur substantial fines have to change our business practices and face reputational harm any of which could have an adverse effect on our business serious breaches of the gdpr can result in administrative fines of up to 4 of annual worldwide revenues fines of up to 2 of annual worldwide revenues can be levied for other specified violations 

• various state privacy laws such as the california consumer privacy act of 2018 ccpa which came into effect in january of 2020 the california privacy rights act cpra which will go into effect in 2023 the virginia consumer data protection act virginia cdpa which will go into effect in 2023 and the colorado privacy act colopa which will go into effect in 2023 all of which give new data privacy rights to their respective residents including in california a private right of action in the event of a data breach resulting from our failure to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices and impose significant obligations on controllers and processors of consumer data 

• sb327 in california which regulates the security of data in connection with internet connected devices 

further we are subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether how and under what circumstances we can transfer process andor receive personal data the euus and the swissus privacy shield frameworks that previously allowed us companies that selfcertify to the us department of commerce and publicly commit to comply with specified requirements to import personal data from the eu and switzerland have been invalidated by the cjeu the cjeu upheld standard contractual clauses sccs as a valid transfer mechanism provided they meet certain requirements on june 4 2021 the european commission published new sccs for this purpose and we may have to adapt our existing contractual arrangements to meet these new requirements the validity of data transfer mechanisms remains subject to legal regulatory and political developments in both europe and the us such as recent recommendations from the european data protection board decisions from supervisory authorities recent proposals for reform of the data transfer mechanisms for transfers of personal data outside the united kingdom and potential invalidation of other data transfer mechanisms which together with increased enforcement action from supervisory authorities in relation to crossborder transfers of personal data could have a significant adverse effect on our ability to process and transfer personal data outside of the european economic area andor the united kingdom 

these laws and regulations are evolving and subject to interpretation including developments which create some uncertainty and compliance obligations could cause us to incur costs or harm the operations of our products and services in ways that harm our business for example in the eu several supervisory authorities have issued new guidance concerning the eprivacy directive’s requirements regarding the use of cookies and similar technologies including limitations on the use of data across messaging products and specific requirements for enabling users to accept or reject cookies and have in some cases brought and may seek to bring in the future enforcement action in relation to those requirements in the us certain types of cookies may be deemed sales of personal information 



within the ccpa and other state laws such that certain disclosure requirements and limitations apply to the use of such cookies in addition some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services and carries the potential of service interruptions in those countries 

we face and may continue to face intellectual property and other claims that could be costly to defend result in significant damage awards or other costs including indemnification awards and limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future 

we like other internet technology and media companies are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights in addition patentholding companies may frequently seek to generate income from patents they have obtained by bringing claims against us as we have grown the number of intellectual property claims against us has increased and may continue to increase as we develop new products services and technologies 

we have had patent copyright trade secret and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that certain of our products services and technologies infringe the intellectual property rights of others other parties have also sought broad injunctive relief against us by filing claims in us and international courts and the us international trade commission itc for exclusion and ceaseanddesist orders which could limit our ability to sell our products or services in the us or elsewhere if our products or services or those of our customers or suppliers are found to infringe the intellectual property subject to the claims adverse results in any of these lawsuits may include awards of monetary damages costly royalty or licensing agreements if licenses are available at all or orders preventing us from offering certain features functionalities products or services they may also cause us to change our business practices and require development of noninfringing products services or technologies which could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business 

many of our agreements with our customers and partners including certain suppliers require us to defend against certain intellectual property infringement claims and in some cases indemnify them for certain intellectual property infringement claims against them which could result in increased costs for defending such claims or significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims such customers and partners may also discontinue the use of our products services and technologies as a result of injunctions or otherwise which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business moreover intellectual property indemnities provided to us by our suppliers when obtainable may not cover all damages and losses suffered by us and our customers arising from intellectual property infringement claims furthermore in connection with our divestitures we have agreed and may in the future agree to provide indemnification for certain potential liabilities including those associated with intellectual property claims regardless of their merits intellectual property claims are often time consuming and expensive to litigate or settle to the extent such claims are successful they may harm our business including our product and service offerings financial condition or operating results 

risks related to ownership of our stock 

we cannot guarantee that any share repurchase program will be fully consummated or will enhance longterm stockholder value and share repurchases could increase the volatility of our stock prices and could diminish our cash reserves 

we engage in share repurchases of our class a and class c stock from time to time in accordance with authorizations from the board of directors of alphabet our repurchase program does not have an expiration date and does not obligate alphabet to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares further our share repurchases could affect our share trading prices increase their volatility reduce our cash reserves and may be suspended or terminated at any time which may result in a decrease in the trading prices of our stock 

the concentration of our stock ownership limits our stockholders’ ability to influence corporate matters 

our class b stock has 10 votes per share our class a stock has one vote per share and our class c stock has no voting rights as of december 31 2021 larry page and sergey brin beneficially owned approximately 859 of our outstanding class b stock which represented approximately 514 of the voting power of our outstanding common stock through their stock ownership larry and sergey have significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets for the foreseeable future in addition because our class c stock carries no voting rights except as required by applicable law the issuance of the class c stock including in future stockbased acquisition transactions and to fund employee equity incentive programs could continue larry and sergey’s current relative voting power and their ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders the share repurchases made pursuant to our repurchase program may also 



affect larry and sergey’s relative voting power this concentrated control limits or severely restricts other stockholders’ ability to influence corporate matters and we may take actions that some of our stockholders do not view as beneficial which could reduce the market price of our class a stock and our class c stock 

provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable 

provisions in alphabet’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management these provisions include the following 

• our certificate of incorporation provides for a triclass capital stock structure as a result of this structure larry and sergey have significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval this concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger takeover or other change of control transaction that other stockholders may view as beneficial 

• our board of directors has the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation death or removal of a director 

• our stockholders may not act by written consent which makes it difficult to take certain actions without holding a stockholders meeting 

• our certificate of incorporation prohibits cumulative voting in the election of directors this limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates 

• stockholders must provide advance notice to nominate individuals for election to the board of directors or to propose matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders’ meeting these provisions may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirers own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company 

• our board of directors may issue without stockholder approval shares of undesignated preferred stock which makes it possible for our board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us 

as a delaware corporation we are also subject to certain delaware antitakeover provisions under delaware law a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15 or more of its outstanding voting stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or among other things the board of directors has approved the transaction our board of directors could rely on delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us 

general risks 

the continuing effects of covid19 are highly unpredictable and could be significant and may have an adverse effect on our business operations and our future financial performance 

since covid19 was declared a global pandemic by the world health organization our business operations and financial performance have been and may continue to be affected by the macroeconomic impacts resulting from the efforts to control the spread of covid19 as a result of the scale of the ongoing pandemic including the introduction of new variants of covid19 and vaccination and other efforts to control the spread our revenue growth rate and expenses as a percentage of our revenues in future periods may differ significantly from our historical rates and our future operating results may fall below expectations additionally we may experience a significant and prolonged shift in user behavior such as a shift in interests to less commercial topics 

as a result of the pandemic our workforce shifted to operating in a primarily remote working environment which continues to create inherent productivity connectivity and oversight challenges the effects of the ongoing pandemic are dynamic and uneven as we prepare to return our workforce in more locations back to the office we may experience increased costs andor disruption as we experiment with hybrid work models in addition to potential effects on our ability to operate effectively and maintain our corporate culture 

our operating results may fluctuate which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our results to fall short of expectations 

our operating results have fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate as a result of a number of factors many outside of our control including the cyclicality and seasonality in our business and geopolitical events as a result comparing our operating results including our expenses as a percentage of our revenues on a periodtoperiod basis may not be meaningful and our past results should not be relied on as an indication of our future performance consequently our operating results in future quarters may fall below expectations 



acquisitions joint ventures investments and divestitures could result in operating difficulties dilution and other consequences that may harm our business financial condition and operating results 

acquisitions joint ventures investments and divestitures are important elements of our overall corporate strategy and use of capital and these transactions could be material to our financial condition and operating results we expect to continue to evaluate and enter into discussions regarding a wide array of such potential strategic transactions which could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures some of the areas where we face risks include 

• diversion of management time and focus from operating our business to challenges related to acquisitions and other strategic transactions 

• failure to obtain required approvals on a timely basis if at all from governmental authorities or conditions placed upon approval that could among other things delay or prevent us from completing a transaction or otherwise restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goals of a transaction 

• failure to successfully integrate and further develop the acquired business or technology 

• implementation or remediation of controls procedures and policies at the acquired company 

• integration of the acquired company’s accounting human resource including cultural integration and retention of employees and other administrative systems and coordination of product engineering and sales and marketing functions 

• transition of operations users and customers onto our existing platforms 

• in the case of foreign acquisitions the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic currency political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries 

• liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition including patent and trademark infringement claims data privacy and security issues violations of laws commercial disputes tax liabilities warranty claims product liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities and 

• litigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company including claims from terminated employees customers former stockholders or other third parties 

our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and other strategic transactions could cause us to fail to realize their anticipated benefits incur unanticipated liabilities and harm our business generally 

our acquisitions and other strategic transactions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses or impairment of goodwill andor purchased longlived assets and restructuring charges any of which could harm our financial condition or operating results also the anticipated benefits or value of our acquisitions and other strategic transactions may not materialize in connection with our divestitures we have agreed and may in the future agree to provide indemnification for certain potential liabilities which may harm our financial condition or operating results 

if we were to lose the services of key personnel we may not be able to execute our business strategy 

our future success depends in large part upon the continued service of key members of our senior management team for instance sundar pichai is critical to the overall management of alphabet and its subsidiaries and plays an important role in the development of our technology maintaining our culture and setting our strategic direction all of our executive officers and key employees are atwill employees and we do not maintain any keyperson life insurance policies the loss of key personnel could seriously harm our business 

we rely on highly skilled personnel and if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel hire qualified personnel or maintain our corporate culture we may not be able to grow effectively 

our performance largely depends on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals our ability to compete effectively and our future success depends on our continuing to identify hire develop motivate and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization competition in our industry for qualified employees is intense and certain of our competitors have directly targeted our employees in addition our compensation arrangements such as our equity award programs may not always be successful in attracting new employees and retaining and motivating our existing employees restrictive immigration policy and regulatory changes may also affect our ability to hire mobilize or retain some of our global talent 



in addition we believe that our corporate culture fosters innovation creativity and teamwork as our organization grows and evolves we may need to implement more complex organizational management structures or adapt our corporate culture and work environments to everchanging circumstances such as during times of a natural disaster or pandemic and these changes could affect our ability to compete effectively or have an adverse effect on our corporate culture 

we are exposed to fluctuations in the fair values of our investments and in some instances our financial statements incorporate valuation methodologies that are subjective in nature resulting in fluctuations over time 

the fair value of our investments may in the future be and certain investments have been in the past negatively affected by liquidity credit deterioration or losses performance and financial results of the underlying entities foreign exchange rates changes in interest rates including changes that may result from the implementation of new benchmark rates the effect of new or changing regulations the stock market in general or other factors 

we measure certain of our nonmarketable equity and debt securities certain other instruments including stockbased compensation awards settled in the stock of certain other bets and certain assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination at fair value on a nonrecurring basis the determination of fair value involves use of appropriate valuation methods and certain unobservable inputs requires management judgment and estimation and may change over time we adjust the carrying value of our nonmarketable equity securities to fair value for observable transactions of identical or similar investments of the same issuer or for impairments all gains and losses on nonmarketable equity securities are recognized in other income expense which increases the volatility of our other income expense the unrealized gains and losses we record from fair value remeasurements of our nonmarketable equity securities in any particular period may differ significantly from the gains or losses we ultimately experience on such investments 

as a result of these factors the value or liquidity of our cash equivalents as well as our marketable and nonmarketable securities could decline and result in a material impairment which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

we could be subject to changes in tax rates the adoption of new us or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities 

our future income taxes could be negatively affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates the net gains and losses recognized by legal entities on certain hedges and related hedged intercompany and other transactions under our foreign exchange risk management program decreases in our stock price for shares paid as employee compensation changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities the application of different provisions of tax laws or changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles including changes in the interpretation of existing laws as well as certain discrete items 

in addition we are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities as a result we have received and may in the future receive assessments in multiple jurisdictions including in europe on various taxrelated assertions such as transferpricing adjustments or permanentestablishment claims any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition and could require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business it may also subject us to additional litigation and regulatory inquiries resulting in the diversion of management’s time and attention in addition the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment and there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain although we believe our estimates are reasonable the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made 

furthermore due to shifting economic and political conditions tax policies laws or rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant changes in ways that impair our financial results various jurisdictions around the world have enacted or are considering digital services taxes which could lead to inconsistent and potentially overlapping international tax regimes the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd continues to advance proposals relating to its initiative for modernizing international tax rules with the goal of having different countries implement a modernized and aligned international tax framework but there can be no guarantee that this will occur 

in addition in response to significant market volatility and disruptions to business operations resulting from the global spread of covid19 legislatures and taxing authorities in many jurisdictions in which we operate may propose changes to their tax rules these changes could include modifications that have temporary effect and more permanent 



changes the effect of these potential new rules on us our longterm tax planning and our effective tax rate could be material 

the trading price for our class a stock and nonvoting class c stock may continue to be volatile 

the trading price of our stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility and may continue to be volatile in addition to the factors discussed in this report the trading price of our class a stock and class c stock have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate widely in response to various factors many of which are beyond our control including among others the activities of our peers and changes in broader economic and political conditions around the world these broad market and industry factors may harm the market price of our class a stock and our class c stock regardless of our actual operating performance

we have omitted discussion of 2019 results where it would be redundant to the discussion previously included in item 7 of our 2020 annual report on form 10k 

understanding alphabet’s financial results 

alphabet is a collection of businesses — the largest of which is google we report google in two segments google services and google cloud we also report all nongoogle businesses collectively as other bets other bets include earlier stage technologies that are further afield from our core google business for further details on our segments see part i item 1 “business” and note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

trends in our business and financial effect 

the following longterm trends have contributed to the results of our consolidated operations and we anticipate that they will continue to affect our future results 

• users behaviors and advertising continue to shift online as the digital economy evolves 

the continuing shift from an offline to online world has contributed to the growth of our business since inception contributing to revenue growth and we expect that this online shift will continue to benefit our business 

• users are increasingly using diverse devices and modalities to access our products and services and our advertising revenues are increasingly coming from new formats 

our users are accessing the internet via diverse devices and modalities such as smartphones wearables and smart home devices and want to be able to be connected no matter where they are or what they are doing we are focused on expanding our products and services to stay in front of these trends in order to maintain and grow our business 

we are increasingly generating advertising revenues from different channels including mobile and newer advertising formats the margins on advertising revenues from these channels and newer products have generally been lower than those from traditional desktop search additionally as the market for a particular device type or modality matures our revenues may be affected for example growth in the global smartphone market has slowed due to various factors including increased market saturation in developed countries which can affect our mobile advertising revenue growth rates 

we expect tac paid to our distribution partners and google network partners to increase as our revenues grow and tac as a percentage of our advertising revenues tac rate to be affected by changes in device mix geographic mix partner mix partner agreement terms the percentage of queries channeled through paid access points product mix the relative revenue growth rates of advertising revenues from different channels and revenue share terms 

we expect these trends to continue to affect our revenue growth rates and put pressure on our margins 

• as online advertising evolves we continue to expand our product offerings which may affect our monetization 

as interactions between users and advertisers change and as online user behavior evolves we continue to expand and evolve our product offerings to serve these changing needs over time we expect our monetization trends to fluctuate for example we have seen an increase in revenues from ads on youtube and google play which monetize at a lower rate than our traditional search ads 

• as users in developing economies increasingly come online our revenues from international markets continue to increase and movements in foreign exchange rates affect such revenues 

the shift to online as well as the advent of the multidevice world has brought opportunities outside of the us including in emerging markets such as india we continue to invest heavily and develop localized versions of our products and advertising programs relevant to our users in these markets this has led to a trend of increased revenues from emerging markets we expect that our results will continue to be affected by our performance in these markets particularly as lowcost mobile devices become more available this trend could affect our revenues as developing markets initially monetize at a lower rate than more mature markets 



international revenues represent a significant portion of our revenues and are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar while we have a foreign exchange risk management program designed to reduce our exposure to these fluctuations this program does not fully offset their effect on our revenues and earnings 

• the portion of revenues that we derive from nonadvertising revenues is increasing and may adversely affect margins 

nonadvertising revenues have grown over time we expect this trend to continue as we focus on expanding our offerings through products and services like google cloud google play hardware products and youtube subscriptions we currently derive nonadvertising revenues primarily from sales of apps and inapp purchases digital content products and hardware and licensing and service fees including fees received for google cloud services and subscription and other services a number of other bets initiatives are in their initial development stages and as such revenues from these businesses could be volatile in addition the margins on these revenues vary significantly and may be lower than the margins on our advertising revenues 

• as we continue to serve our users and expand our businesses we will invest heavily in operating and capital expenditures 

we continue to make significant rd investments in areas of strategic focus across google services google cloud and other bets we also expect to continue to invest in land and buildings for data centers and offices and information technology assets which includes servers and network equipment to support the longterm growth of our business in addition acquisitions and strategic investments contribute to the breadth and depth of our offerings expand our expertise in engineering and other functional areas and build strong partnerships around strategic initiatives for example in january 2021 we closed the acquisition of fitbit inc for 21 billion which is expected to help spur innovation in wearable devices 

• we face continuing changes in regulatory conditions laws and public policies which could affect our business practices and financial results 

changes in social political economic tax and regulatory conditions or in laws and policies governing a wide range of topics and related legal matters have resulted in fines and caused us to change our business practices as these global trends continue our cost of doing business may increase and our ability to pursue certain business models or offer certain products or services may be limited examples include the antitrust complaints filed by the us department of justice and a number of state attorneys general the digital markets act in europe and various legislative proposals in the us focused on large technology platforms 

• our employees are critical to our success and we expect to continue investing in them 

our employees are among our best assets and are critical for our continued success we expect to continue hiring talented employees around the globe and to provide competitive compensation programs for additional information see culture and workforce in part i item 1 “business” 

seasonality and other 

our advertising revenues are affected by seasonal fluctuations in internet usage advertising expenditures and underlying business trends such as traditional retail seasonality additionally our nonadvertising revenues including those generated from google cloud google play hardware and youtube may be affected by fluctuations driven by changes in pricing digital content releases fee structures new product and service launches other market dynamics as well as seasonality 

revenues and monetization metrics 

google services 

google services revenues consist of revenues generated from advertising “google advertising” as well as revenues from other sources “google other revenues” 

google advertising 

google advertising revenues are comprised of the following 

• google search  other which includes revenues generated on google search properties including revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use googlecom as their default search in browsers toolbars etc and other google owned and operated properties like gmail google maps and google play 

• youtube ads which includes revenues generated on youtube properties and 



• google network which includes revenues generated on google network properties participating in admob adsense and google ad manager 

we use certain metrics to track how well traffic across various properties is monetized as it relates to our advertising revenues paid clicks and costperclick pertain to traffic on google search  other properties while impressions and costperimpressions pertain to traffic on our network partners’ properties 

paid clicks represent engagement by users and include clicks on advertisements by endusers on google search properties and other google owned and operated properties including gmail google maps and google play costperclick is defined as clickdriven revenues divided by our total number of paid clicks and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each engagement by users 

impressions include impressions displayed to users on google network properties participating primarily in admob adsense and google ad manager costperimpression is defined as impressionbased and clickbased revenues divided by our total number of impressions and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each impression displayed to users 

as our business evolves we periodically review refine and update our methodologies for monitoring gathering and counting the number of paid clicks and the number of impressions and for identifying the revenues generated by the corresponding click and impression activity 

our advertising revenue growth as well as the change in paid clicks and costperclick on google search  other properties and the change in impressions and costperimpression on google network properties and the correlation between these items have been affected and may continue to be affected by various factors including 

• advertiser competition for keywords 

• changes in advertising quality formats delivery or policy 

• changes in device mix 

• changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

• fees advertisers are willing to pay based on how they manage their advertising costs 

• general economic conditions including the effect of covid19 

• seasonality and 

• traffic growth in emerging markets compared to more mature markets and across various advertising verticals and channels 

google other

• google play which includes sales of apps and inapp purchases and digital content sold in the google play store 

• devices and services which includes sales of hardware including fitbit wearable devices google nest home products and pixel phones 

• youtube nonadvertising which includes youtube premium and youtube tv subscriptions and 

• other products and services 

google cloud

• google cloud platform which includes fees for infrastructure platform and other services 

• google workspace which includes fees for cloudbased collaboration tools for enterprises such as gmail docs drive calendar and meet and

for further details on how we recognize revenue see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

costs and expenses 

our cost structure has two components cost of revenues and operating expenses our operating expenses include costs related to rd sales and marketing and general and administrative functions certain of these expenses including those associated with the operation of our technical infrastructure as well as components of our operating expenses are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate to the changes in revenue 

cost of revenues 

cost of revenues is comprised of tac and other costs of revenues 

• tac includes 

◦ amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services our distribution partners include browser providers mobile carriers original equipment manufacturers and software developers 

◦ amounts paid to google network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties 

• other cost of revenues includes 

◦ content acquisition costs which are payments to content providers from whom we license video and other content for distribution on youtube and google play we pay fees to these content providers based on revenues generated or a flat fee 

◦ expenses associated with our data centers including bandwidth compensation expenses depreciation energy and other equipment costs as well as other operations costs such as content review as well as customer and product support costs 

◦ inventory and other costs related to the hardware we sell 

the cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on google network properties are significantly higher than the cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on google search  other properties because most of the advertiser revenues from ads served on google network properties are paid as tac to our google network partners 

operating expenses 

operating expenses are generally incurred during our normal course of business which we categorize as either rd sales and marketing or general and administrative 

the main components of our rd expenses are 

• compensation expenses for engineering and technical employees responsible for rd related to our existing and new products and services

the effect of covid19 on our financial results 

we began to observe the effect of covid19 on our financial results in march 2020 when despite an increase in users search activity our advertising revenues declined compared to the prior year this was due to a shift of user search activity to less commercial topics and reduced spending by our advertisers for the quarter ended june 30 2020 our advertising revenues declined due to the continued effects of covid19 and the related reductions in global economic activity but we observed a gradual return in user search activity to more commercial topics this was followed by increased spending by our advertisers which continued throughout the second half of 2020 additionally over the course of 2020 we experienced variability in our margins as many of our expenses are less variable in nature andor may not correlate to changes in revenues market volatility contributed to fluctuations in the valuation of our equity investments further our assessment of the credit deterioration of our customers due to changes in the macroeconomic environment during the period was reflected in our allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable 

throughout 2021 we remained focused on innovating and investing in the services we offer to consumers and businesses to support our longterm growth the impact of covid19 on 2020 financial results affected yearoveryear growth trends the covid19 pandemic continues to evolve be unpredictable and affect our business and financial results our past results may not be indicative of our future performance and historical trends in our financial results may differ materially

for further details on revenues by geography see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

use of constant currency revenues and constant currency revenue percentage change 

the effect of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period to period comparisons we use nongaap constant currency revenues and nongaap percentage change in constant currency revenues for financial and operational decisionmaking and as a means to evaluate periodtoperiod comparisons we believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to us generally accepted accounting principles gaap results helps improve the ability to understand our performance because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results 

constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period we define constant currency revenues as total revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements and hedging activities and use it to determine the constant currency revenue percentage change on a yearonyear basis constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior year comparable period exchange rates as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period 

constant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the change in current period revenues over prior year comparable period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are translated using prior year comparable period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of both periods 

these results should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for results reported in accordance with gaap results on a constant currency basis as we present them may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with gaap

the increase in other cost of revenues from 2020 to 2021 was driven by increases in content acquisition costs primarily for youtube data center and other operations costs and hardware costs the increase in data center and

critical accounting estimates 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap in doing so we have to make estimates and assumptions our critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of uncertainty at the time the estimate was made and changes in them have had or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations accordingly actual results could differ materially from our estimates we base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis we have reviewed our critical accounting estimates with the audit and compliance committee of our board of directors 

see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for a summary of significant accounting policies and the effect on our financial statements 

fair value measurements of nonmarketable equity securities 

we measure certain financial instruments at fair value on a nonrecurring basis consisting primarily of our nonmarketable equity securities these investments are accounted for under the measurement alternative and are measured at cost less impairment subject to upward and downward adjustments resulting from observable price changes for identical or similar investments of the same issuer these adjustments require quantitative assessments of the fair value of our securities which may require the use of unobservable inputs pricing adjustments are determined by using various valuation methodologies and involve the use of estimates using the best information available which may include cash flow projections or other available market data 

nonmarketable equity securities are also evaluated for impairment based on qualitative factors including the companies financial and liquidity position and access to capital resources among others when indicators of impairment exist we prepare quantitative measurements of the fair value of our equity investments using a market approach or an income approach which requires judgment and the use of unobservable inputs including discount rates investee revenues and costs and comparable market data of private and public companies among others when our assessment indicates that an impairment exists we write down the investment to its fair value 



we also have compensation arrangements with payouts based on realized returns from certain investments ie performance fees we recognize compensation expense based on the estimated payouts which may result in expense recognized before investment returns are realized and may require the use of unobservable inputs 

property and equipment 

we assess the reasonableness of the useful lives of our property and equipment periodically as well as when other changes occur such as when there are changes to ongoing business operations changes in the planned use and utilization of assets or technological advancements that could indicate a change in the period over which we expect to benefit from the assets 

income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 

recording an uncertain tax position involves various qualitative considerations including evaluation of comparable and resolved tax exposures applicability of tax laws and likelihood of settlement we evaluate uncertain tax positions periodically considering changes in facts and circumstances such as new regulations or recent judicial opinions as well as the status of audit activities by taxing authorities although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will affect the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination is made 

the provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue services irs and other tax authorities which may assert assessments against us we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 

loss contingencies 

we are regularly subject to claims suits regulatory and government investigations and other proceedings involving competition intellectual property privacy tax and related compliance labor and employment commercial disputes content generated by our users goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms personal injury consumer protection and other matters certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages we record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated if we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated we disclose the possible loss in note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

we evaluate on a regular basis developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed and make adjustments and changes to our disclosures as appropriate significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters until the final resolution of such matters there may be an exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded and such amounts could be material 

change in accounting estimate 

in january 2021 we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and certain network equipment in doing so we determined we should adjust the estimated useful life this change in accounting estimate was effective beginning fiscal year 2021 and is detailed further in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and equity investment risks 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we transact business globally in multiple currencies international revenues as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar principal currencies hedged included the australian dollar british pound canadian dollar euro and japanese yen for the purpose of analyzing foreign currency exchange risk we considered the historical trends in 



foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates of 10 could be experienced in the near term 

we use foreign exchange forward contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary these forward contracts reduce but do not entirely eliminate the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities the foreign currency gains and losses on these assets and liabilities are recorded in other income expense net which are offset by the gains and losses on the forward contracts 

if an adverse 10 foreign currency exchange rate change was applied to total monetary assets liabilities and commitments denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies at the balance sheet date it would have resulted in an adverse effect on income before income taxes of approxima tely 497 million and 285 million as of december 31 2020 and 2021 respectively after consideration of the effect of foreign exchange contracts in place for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2021 

we use foreign currency forwards and option contracts including collars an option strategy comprised of a combination of purchased and written options to protect forecasted us dollarequivalent earnings from changes in foreign currency exchange rates when the us dollar strengthens gains from foreign currency options and forwards reduce the foreign currency losses related to our earnings when the us dollar weakens losses from foreign currency collars and forwards offset the foreign currency gains related to our earnings these hedging contracts reduce but do not entirely eliminate the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements we designate these contracts as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes we reflect the gains or losses of foreign currency spot rate changes as a component of aoci and subsequently reclassify them into revenues to offset the hedged exposures as they occur 

i f the us dollar weakened by 10 as of december 31 2020 and 2021 the amount recorded in aoci related to our foreign exchange contracts before tax effect would have been approximately 912 million and 13 billion lower as of december 31 2020 and 2021 respectively the change in the value recorded in aoci would be expected to offset a corresponding foreign currency change in forecasted hedged revenues when recognized 

we use foreign exchange forward contracts designated as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks related to investment in foreign subsidiaries these forward contracts serve to offset the foreign currency translation risk from our foreign operations 

if the us dollar weakened by 10 the amount recorded in cumulative translation adjustment cta within aoci related to our net investment hedge would have been approximately 10 billion lower as of both december 31 2020 and 2021 the change in value recorded in cta would be expected to offset a corresponding foreign currency translation gain or loss from our investment in foreign subsidiaries 

interest rate risk 

our corporate treasury investment strategy is to achieve a return that w ill allow us to preserve capital and maintain liquidity we invest primarily in debt securities including those of the us government and its agencies corporate debt securities mortgagebacked securities money market and other funds municipal securities time deposits asset backed securities and debt instruments issued by foreign governments by policy we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer our investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities carry a degree of interest rate risk fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall unrealized gains or losses on our marketable debt securities are primarily due to interest rate fluctuations as compared to interest rates at the time of purchase for certain fixed and variable rate debt securities we have elected the fair value option for which changes in fair value are recorded in other income expense net we measure securities for which we have not elected the fair value option at fair value with gains and losses recorded in aoci until the securities are sold less any expected credit losses 

we use valueatrisk var analysis to determine the potential effect of fluctuations in interest rates on the value of our marketable debt security portfolio the var is the expected loss in fair value for a given confidence interval for our investment portfolio due to adverse movements in interest rates we use a variancecovariance var model with 95 confidence interval the estimated oneday loss in fair value of marketable debt securities as of december 31 2020 and 2021 are shown below in millions 





actual future gains and losses associated with our marketable debt security portfolio may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of december 31 2020 and 2021 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates and our actual exposures and positions var analysis is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation 

equity investment risk 

our marketable and nonmarketable equity securities are subject to a wide variety of marketrelated risks that could substantially reduce or increase the fair value of our holdings 

our marketable equity securities are publicly traded stocks or funds and our nonmarketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies some of which are in the startup or development stages 

we record marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method at fair value based on readily determinable market values of which publicly traded stocks and mutual funds are subject to market price volatility and represent 59 billion and 78 billion of our investments as of december 31 2020 and 2021 respectively a hypothetical adverse price change of 10 on our december 31 2021 balance which could be experienced in the near term would decrease the fair value of marketable equity securities by 780 million from time to time we may enter into derivatives to hedge the market price risk on certain of our marketable equity securities 

our nonmarketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method are adjusted to fair value for observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment referred to as the measurement alternative the fair value measured at the time of the observable transaction is not necessarily an indication of the current fair value as of the balance sheet date these investments especially those that are in the early stages are inherently risky because the technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early phases and may never materialize and they may experience a decline in financial condition which could result in a loss of a substantial part of our investment in these companies the success of our investment in any private company is also typically dependent on the likelihood of our ability to realize appreciation in the value of investments through liquidity events such as public offerings acquisitions private sales or other market events as of december 31 2020 and 2021 the carrying value of our nonmarketable equity securities which were accounted for under the measurement alternative was 189 billion and 276 billion respectively valuations of our equity investments in private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data volatility in the global economic climate and financial markets could result in a significant impairment charge relating to our nonmarketable equity securities changes in valuation of nonmarketable equity securities may not directly correlate with changes in valuation of marketable equity securities additionally observable transactions at lower valuations could result in significant losses on our nonmarketable equity securities the effect of covid19 on our impairment assessment requires significant judgment due to the uncertainty around the duration and severity of the effect 

the carrying values of our equity method investments which totaled approximately 14 billion and 15 billion as of december 31 2020 and 2021 respectively generally do not fluctuate based on market price changes however these investments could be impaired if the carrying value exceeds the fair value and is not expected to recover

 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

none 




 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

our management with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to rule 13a15 under the exchange act as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k 

based on this evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of december 31 2021 our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

we rely extensively on information systems to manage our business and summarize and report operating results in 2019 we began a multiyear implementation of a new global erp system which will replace much of our existing core financial systems the erp system is designed to accurately maintain our financial records enhance the flow of financial information improve data management and provide timely information to our management team the implementation is expected to continue in phases over the next few years we completed the implementation of certain of our subledgers which included changes to our processes procedures and internal controls over financial reporting during the second quarter of 2021 there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended december 31 2021 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting however as the phased implementation of the new erp system continues we will change our processes and procedures which in turn could result in changes to our internal control over financial reporting as such changes occur we will evaluate quarterly whether such changes materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

as a result of covid19 our global workforce continued to operate primarily in a work from home environment for the quarter ended december 31 2021 while we continue to evolve our work model in response to the uneven effects of the ongoing pandemic around the world we believe that our internal controls over financial reporting continue to be eff ective we have continued to reevaluate and refine our financial reporting process to provide reasonable assurance that we could report our financial results accurately and in a timely manner 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f of the exchange act our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 2013 framework based on this evaluation management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2021 management reviewed the results of its assessment with our audit and compliance committee the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2021 has been audited by ernst  young llp  an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in its report which is included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

limitations on effectiveness of controls and procedures 

in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures management recognizes that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives in addition the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs
