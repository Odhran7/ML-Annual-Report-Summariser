any outbreaks of contagious diseases and other adverse public health developments in countries where we operate could have a material and adverse effect on our business operations financial condition liquidity and results of operations for example the covid19 pandemic has affected our offices and manufacturing facilities throughout the world as well as the facilities of our suppliers customers and our customers’ contract manufacturers t he covid19 pandemic caused widespread disruptions to our company during the first half of 2020 and to a lesser extent those disruptions continued during the second half of 2020 and throughout all of 2021 a s of december 31 2021 we continue to experience some disruptions and at a minimum particularly given the surge of cases resulting from the omicron variant we expect those disruptions to continue into 2022 and potentially beyond these disruptions have included and may continue to include government regulations that inhibit our ability to operate certain of our facilities in the ordinary course travel restrictions supplier constraints supplychain interruptions logistics challenges and limitations labor disruptions and reduced demand from certain customers during 2021 and into 2022 there have been resurgences in covid19 cases in several regions around the world particularly related to new variant strains including delta and omicron the extent to which the covid19 pandemic will continue to impact our business and financial results going forward will be dependent on future developments such as the length and severity of the crisis the impact of the recent resurgence of the crisis due to the omicron variant as well as any additional future resurgences from known or new variants future government regulations and actions in response to the crisis the timing availability effectiveness and adoption rates of vaccines and treatments and the overall impact of the covid19 pandemic on the global economy and capital markets among many other factors all of which remain highly uncertain and unpredictable in addition the covid19 pandemic could impact the health of our management team and other employees given these uncertainties we expect the pandemic to continue to have an impact on our business operations financial condition liquidity and results of operations in 2022 and potentially beyond there can be no assurance that the covid19 pandemic will not have a material and adverse effect on our business operations financial condition liquidity and results of operations in the future 

​ 

in addition the covid19 pandemic has and continues to increase the likelihood and potential severity of other risks some discussed separately within this item 1a risk factors  including but not limited to the following

​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 



​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

the company and certain of its suppliers and customers are experiencing difficulties obtaining certain raw materials and components and the cost of most of the company’s raw materials and components is increasing 

​ 

the company uses basic materials like aluminum steel copper titanium metal alloys gold silver palladium and plastic resins in its manufacturing processes as well as a variety of components and relies on thirdparty suppliers to secure these materials and components the covid19 pandemic initially disrupted the supply of such raw materials and components primarily in the first half of 2020 however more recently in 2021 and the first quarter of 2022 we along with many of our suppliers and customers have experienced widespread supply chain disruptions that have resulted in significant cost increases across certain raw materials and components as well as some supply shortages that collectively have had an adverse impact on our business and operating results for example the recent market shortage of semiconductors has caused disruptions from both a supply and pricing standpoint in some of the markets we serve in particular the automotive market recent inflationary pressures have been exacerbated by the lower availability of and increased prices for freight and logistics including air sea and ground freight in addition the company may not be able to pass along increased raw material or component prices to its customers while the company has taken and continues to take measures to procure and obtain sufficient quantities of raw materials and components at acceptable prices from our suppliers there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to do so accordingly any future delays disruptions and supply and pricing risks such as the ongoing supply chain challenges and disruptions that we expect to continue during 2022 could affect our ability to meet customer demand for our products which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

​ 

in limited instances we depend on a single source of supply or participate in commodity markets that may be served by a limited number of suppliers delays in obtaining supplies may result from a number of factors affecting our suppliers and any delay could impair our ability to deliver products to our customers the cost and availability of raw materials may fluctuate significantly due to external factors including but not limited to product scarcity disruptions caused by climate change and adverse weather conditions commodity market fluctuations currency fluctuations governmental policies and regulations such as trade tariffs as well as pandemics and epidemics such as but not limited to the covid19 pandemic which may in turn negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition 

​ 

the company may be negatively impacted by extreme weather conditions and natural catastrophic events including those caused by climate change and global warming 

​ 

from time to time extreme weather conditions and natural disasters have negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact our operations as well as the operations of our suppliers vendors customers and distributors such extreme weather conditions and natural disasters including but not limited to earthquakes fires floods hurricanes tornadoes  and stronger and longerlasting weather patterns and their consequences and effects have in the past temporarily disrupted our business operations both in the united states and abroad these events could cause some of the company’s operations to suffer from supply chain disruptions and potential delays in fulfilling customer orders or order cancellations altogether lost future business and sales andor damage to our property or harm to our people each and all of which could have an adverse effect on our business operations financial condition and results of operations 

​ 

our international operations require us to comply with anticorruption laws and regulations of the us government and various foreign jurisdictions and our business reputation and financial results may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees customers suppliers distributors or any other business partners 

​ 

doing business on a worldwide basis requires us and our subsidiaries to comply with the laws and regulations of the us government and various foreign jurisdictions and our failure to comply with these rules and regulations may expose us to significant liabilities these laws and regulations may apply to companies individual directors officers employees subcontractors and agents and may restrict our operations trade practices investment decisions and partnering activities in particular our international operations are subject to us and foreign anticorruption laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 as amended “fcpa” as part of our business we deal with stateowned business enterprises the employees and representatives of which may be considered foreign officials for purposes of the fcpa in addition some of the foreign locations in which we operate lack a developed legal system and have elevated levels of corruption as a result of the above activities we are exposed to the risk of violating us and foreign anticorruption laws 

​ 

we have established policies and procedures designed to assist us and our personnel in complying with applicable us and international laws and regulations however there can be no assurance that these policies will be effective in preventing our directors officers employees subcontractors and agents from taking actions that violate these legal requirements violations of these legal requirements could subject us to criminal fines and imprisonment civil penalties disgorgement of profits injunctions debarment from government contracts and other remedial measures in addition any actual or alleged violations could disrupt our operations cause reputational harm involve significant management distraction and result in a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

​ 

the company’s results have at times been negatively affected by foreign currency exchange rates 

​ 

the company conducts business in many foreign currencies through its worldwide operations and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies including possible foreign currency restrictions andor devaluations changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the company’s sales operating margins and equity the company manages currency exposure risk in a number of ways including producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency cost reduction and pricing actions working capital management and hedging contracts however there can be no assurance that these actions will be fully effective in managing currency risk including in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the foreign currencies of the company’s worldwide operations which could have an adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

​ 

the company is dependent on attracting recruiting hiring and retaining skilled employees including as part of our various management teams 

​ 

our performance is dependent on our ability to attract recruit hire and retain skilled personnel including our executive and management teams given the current inflationary wage environment and strong demand for skilled labor in many of the countries and regions in which we operate the ability to identify and attract new talent as well as retain existing talent may prove to be difficult it is possible that the current labor market could have an adverse effect on our ability to attract recruit hire and retain skilled employees which in turn could have an adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations in particular as a result of the covid19 pandemic many workers around the world have reassessed their career plans and priorities which could lead to increased difficulty of the company in retaining its experienced team members 

​ 

risks related to our end markets 

​ 

the company is dependent on the communications industry including information technology and data communications wireless communications and broadband communications 

​ 

approximately 42 of the company’s 2021 net sales came from sales to the communications industry including information technology and data communication wireless communications and broadband communications with 12 of the company’s 2021 net sales coming from sales to the mobile devices market demand for these products is subject 

to rapid technological change in addition these markets are dominated by several large manufacturers and operators who regularly exert significant pressure on their suppliers including the company furthermore a trend among customers has been to consolidate their lists of qualified suppliers to companies that have the ability to meet certain technical quality delivery and other standards while maintaining competitive prices there can be no assurance that the company will be able to meet these standards or maintain competitive pricing and therefore continue to compete successfully in the communications industry the company’s failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

​ 

approximately 4 and 5 of the company’s 2021 net sales came from sales to the broadband communications and mobile networks markets respectively demand for the company’s products in these markets depends primarily on capital spending by operators for constructing rebuilding or upgrading their systems the amount of this capital spending and therefore the company’s sales and profitability could be affected by a variety of factors including general economic conditions consolidation within the communications industry the financial condition of operators and their access to financing competition technological developments new legislation and regulation of operators there can be no assurance that existing levels of capital spending will continue or that spending will not decrease 

​ 

changes in defense expenditures may reduce the company’s sales 

​ 

approximately 11 of the company’s 2021 net sales came from sales to the military market the company participates in a broad spectrum of defense programs the company’s military sales are generally to contractors and subcontractors of the us or foreign governments or to distributors that in turn sell to the contractors and subcontractors accordingly the company’s sales are affected by changes in the defense budgets of the us and foreign governments a significant decline in us or foreign government defense expenditures could have an adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations us and foreign government expenditures are also subject to political and budgetary fluctuations and constraints which may result in significant unexpected changes in levels of demand for our products 

​ 

the company encounters competition in substantially all areas of our business 

​ 

the company competes primarily on the basis of technology innovation product quality and performance price customer service and delivery time competitors include large diversified companies some of which have greater assets and financial resources than the company as well as medium to smallsized companies in addition rapid technological changes occurring in the communications industry could also lead to the entry of new competitors of all sizes against whom we may not be able to successfully compete there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against existing or new competition and the inability to do so may result in price reductions reduced margins or loss of market share any of which could have an adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

​ 

risks related to acquisitions 

​ 

the company has at times experienced difficulties and unanticipated expenses in connection with purchasing and integrating newly acquired businesses 

​ 

the company has completed a number of acquisitions in recent years including seven in 2021 the company anticipates that it will continue to pursue acquisition opportunities as part of its growth strategy from time to time the company experiences difficulty and unanticipated expenses associated with purchasing and integrating acquisitions and acquisitions do not always perform and deliver the financial benefits expected the company has also experienced challenges at times following the acquisition of a new company or business including but not limited to managing the operations manufacturing facilities and technology maintaining and increasing the customer base or retaining key employees suppliers and distributors in certain limited cases the company has pursued indemnification claims against the seller or sellers of an acquired business for preacquisition liabilities breaches of representations warranties or covenants or for other reasons provided for in the relevant acquisition agreement to the extent we pursue indemnification claims against the seller or sellers of any acquired business such seller or sellers may successfully contest such claims such seller or sellers may not have the financial capacity to compensate us for such claims or such claims may otherwise be difficult or impractical to enforce we cannot predict or guarantee whether and to what extent anticipated cost savings benefits and growth prospects will be achieved from recent or future acquisitions 

​ 

the company may in the future incur goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges 

​ 

on december 31 2021 the total assets of the company were 147 billion which included 64 billion of goodwill the excess of fair value of consideration paid over the fair value of net identifiable assets of businesses acquired and 7569 million of other intangible assets net the company performs annual evaluations or more frequently if necessary for the potential impairment of the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets such evaluations to date have not resulted in the need to recognize an impairment however if the financial performance of the company’s businesses were to decline significantly the company could incur a material noncash charge to its income statement for the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets furthermore we cannot provide assurance that impairment charges in the future will not be required if the expected cash flow estimates as projected by management do not occur especially if an economic recession occurs and continues for a lengthy period or becomes severe or if acquisitions and investments made by the company fail to achieve expected returns 

​ 

risks related to our liquidity and capital resources 

​ 

the company’s credit agreement contains certain covenants which if breached could have a material adverse effect on the company 

​ 

the second amended and restated credit agreement that governs our 25 billion unsecured credit facility the “revolving credit facility” which also backstops the company’s us commercial paper program “us commercial paper program” and euro commercial paper program “euro commercial paper program” contains financial and other covenants such as a limit on the ratio of debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization a limit on priority indebtedness and limits on incurrence of liens although the company believes none of these covenants is presently restrictive to the company’s operations the ability to meet the financial covenants can be affected by events beyond the company’s control and the company cannot provide assurance that it will meet those tests a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the revolving credit facility upon the occurrence of an event of default under the revolving credit facility the lenders could terminate all commitments to extend further credit and elect to declare amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable which could result in the acceleration of certain of the company’s other indebtedness and the company not having sufficient assets to repay the revolving credit facility and such other indebtedness as of december 31 2021 the company had approximately 7952 million of outstanding borrowings under the us commercial paper program and no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and euro commercial paper program 

​ 

the company relies on the global capital markets and an inability to access those markets on favorable terms could adversely affect the company’s results 

​ 

the company has used the global capital markets to invest in its business and make strategic acquisitions if general economic and capital market conditions deteriorate significantly it could impact the company’s ability to access the capital markets the capital and credit markets have experienced significant volatility in the past market conditions could make it more difficult to access capital to finance capital investments acquisitions and other initiatives including dividends and share repurchases as such this could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition results of operations or cash flows in addition if the credit rating agencies that rate the company’s debt were to downgrade the company’s credit rating it would likely increase the company’s cost of capital and make it more difficult for the company to obtain new financing and access capital markets which could also have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

​ 

the company’s results may be negatively affected by changing interest rates  

​ 

the company may be subject to interest rate volatility with regard to existing and future issuances of debt the company monitors its mix of fixedrate and variablerate debt as well as its mix of shortterm and longterm debt as of december 31 2021 approximately 804 million or 17 of the company’s outstanding borrowings were subject to floating interest rates and were primarily comprised of borrowings under the us commercial paper program a 10 change in floating interest rates at december 31 2021 would not have a material effect on the company’s interest expense however there can be no assurance that interest rates will not change more significantly 

​ 

legal and regulatory risks 

​ 

cybersecurity incidents affecting our information technology systems could disrupt business operations or cause the release of highly sensitive confidential information resulting in adverse impacts to our reputation and operating results and potentially leading to litigation andor governmental investigations 

​ 

cybersecurity threats including but not limited to malware phishing credential harvesting ransomware and other increasingly sophisticated attacks continue to expand and evolve globally making it difficult to detect and prevent such threats from impacting the company globally there has been an increased volume of cyber threats and ransomware attempts throughout the covid19 pandemic ransomware attacks have become easier to execute and the rise of cryptocurrency has facilitated payments to criminals making ransomware a more lucrative business while the company has been a target of various cybersecurity attacks including but not limited to ransomware attacks the impact of such attacks has not been material future cybersecurity incidents could lead to unauthorized access to and potentially impair the company’s information technology systems products customers suppliers and thirdparty service providers cybersecurity incidents could potentially result in the disruption of our business operations andor misappropriation destruction or corruption of critical data and confidential or proprietary information cybersecurity events could also result in the loss of or inability to access confidential information and critical business financial or other data andor cause the release of highly sensitive confidential information cybersecurity incidents could also result from unauthorized parties gaining access to our systems or information through fraudulent or other means of deceiving our employees suppliers or thirdparty service providers in addition the ongoing covid19 pandemic may increase our susceptibility to cybersecurity incidents and risks especially as some of our employees have transitioned and continue to work from home despite the company’s implementation of preventative security measures to prevent detect address and mitigate these threats our infrastructure may still be susceptible to disruptions from cybersecurity incidents ransomware attacks security breaches computer viruses outages systems failures natural disasters adverse public health developments or other catastrophic events any of which could include reputational damage loss of our intellectual property release of highly sensitive confidential information the inability to access critical data litigation with third parties andor governmental investigations and fines among other things which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

​ 

we and our business partners maintain significant amounts of data electronically in locations around the world this data relates to all aspects of our business including financial information and current and future products under development and also contains certain customer supplier partner and employee data we maintain systems and processes designed to protect this data but notwithstanding such protective measures there is a risk of intrusion cyberattacks or tampering that could compromise the integrity and privacy of this data or make the data inaccessible to us in addition in certain cases in order to conduct business we outsource to thirdparty business partners we generally obtain assurances from those parties that they have systems and processes in place to protect our data and where applicable that they will take steps to assure the protection of our data nonetheless those partners may also be subject to data intrusion or a cyberattack any compromise of the data could substantially disrupt our operations harm our customers employees and other business partners damage our reputation violate applicable laws and regulations and subject us to potentially significant costs and liabilities

​ 

the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding with frequent imposition of new and changing requirements for example the european unions general data protection regulation “gdpr” which became effective in may 2018 the state of california’s california consumer privacy act “ccpa” which became effective january 1 2020 and more recently in august 2021 the standing committee of the national people’s congress of the people’s republic of china’s personal information protection law “pipl” which became effective on november 1 2021 impose significant requirements and additional obligations for companies on how they collect process and transfer personal data by enhancing consumer privacy rights and imposing significant fines for noncompliance the potential for fines and other related costs in the event of a breach of or noncompliance with the gdpr ccpa pipl or other existing or proposed information security or privacy laws and requirements may have an adverse effect on our financial results 

​ 

our business and financial results may be adversely affected by government contracting risks 

​ 

we are subject to various laws and regulations applicable to parties doing business with the us and other governments including laws and regulations governing performance of government contracts the use and treatment of government furnished property and the nature of materials used in our products in the us we may be unilaterally suspended or barred from conducting business with the us government or its suppliers both directly and indirectly or 

become subject to fines or other sanctions if we are found to have violated such laws or regulations as a result of the need to comply with these laws and regulations we are subject to increased risks of governmental investigations civil fraud actions criminal prosecutions whistleblower lawsuits and other enforcement actions for example in august 2018 we received a subpoena from the us department of defense office of the inspector general requesting documents pertaining to certain products manufactured by the company’s military and aerospace group that are purchased or used by the us government as noted herein in item 3 legal proceedings and note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements the us laws and regulations to which we are subject include but are not limited to export administration regulations the federal acquisition regulation the false claims act international traffic in arms regulations regulations from the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms and the fcpa we are subject to a wide range of similar laws and regulations in other countries throughout the world failure or the perceived failure to comply with applicable requirements also could harm our reputation and our ability to compete for future government contracts or sell commercial equivalent products any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business operations financial condition liquidity and results of operations 

​ 

in addition us government contracts are subject to modification curtailment or termination by the us government without prior written notice either for convenience or for default as a result of our failure to perform under the applicable contract if our contracts are terminated by the us government as a result of our default we could be liable for additional costs the us government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages it suffers we are also prohibited from assigning prime us government contracts without the prior consent of the us government contracting officer furthermore the us government periodically audits our governmental contract costs which could result in fines penalties or adjustment of costs and prices under the contracts any such fines penalties or payment adjustments resulting from such audits could adversely affect our reputation business operations financial condition liquidity and results of operations 

​ 

the company is subject to governmental export and import controls 

​ 

certain of our products including purchased components of such products are subject to export controls and may be exported only with the required export license or through an export license exception in addition we are required to comply with certain us and foreign sanctions and embargoes these laws and regulations are complex may change frequently and with limited notice have generally become more stringent over time and have intensified under recent us administrations especially in light of recent trade tensions with china for example in 2019 the us government added certain of the company’s customers based in china to its “entity list” which imposes additional restrictions on sales to such customers although such restrictions did not have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations the us government has the power to place even greater restrictions on these and other customers and such restrictions could further limit or prohibit the company from selling products to such customers if we were to fail to comply with these restrictions or applicable export licensing customs regulations economic sanctions and other laws we could be subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties including fines for us the incarceration of responsible employees and managers and the possible loss of export or import privileges in addition if our distributors fail to obtain appropriate import export or reexport licenses or permits we may also be adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties obtaining the necessary export license for a particular sale may be timeconsuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities 

​ 

changes in fiscal and tax policies audits and examinations by taxing authorities could impact the company’s results 

​ 

the company is subject to tax in the us and in numerous foreign jurisdictions the company is currently under tax examination in several jurisdictions and in addition new examinations could be initiated by additional tax authorities as the company has operations in jurisdictions throughout the world the risk of tax examinations will continue to occur the company’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows may be materially impacted by the results of these tax examinations 

​ 

any future changes in tax laws regulations accounting standards for income taxes andor other tax guidance including related interpretations could materially impact the company’s current and noncurrent tax liabilities along with deferred tax assets and liabilities and consequently our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

​ 

we may experience difficulties in enforcing our intellectual property rights which could result in loss of market share and we may be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others 

​ 

we rely on patent and trade secret laws copyright trademark confidentiality procedures controls and contractual commitments to protect our intellectual property rights despite our efforts these protections may be limited and from time to time we encounter difficulties in protecting our intellectual property rights particularly in certain countries outside the us we cannot provide assurance that the patents that we hold or may obtain will provide meaningful protection against our competitors changes in laws concerning intellectual property or the enforcement of such laws may affect our ability to prevent or address the misappropriation of or the unauthorized use of our intellectual property potentially resulting in loss of market share litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights litigation is inherently uncertain and outcomes are unpredictable if we cannot protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized copying or use or other misappropriation we may not remain competitive 

​ 

the intellectual property rights of others could inhibit our ability to introduce new products other companies hold patents on technologies used in our industries and are aggressively seeking to expand enforce and license their patent portfolios we periodically receive notices from or have lawsuits filed against us by third parties claiming infringement misappropriation or other misuse of their intellectual property rights andor breach of our agreements with them these third parties may include entities that do not have the capabilities to design manufacture or distribute products or that acquire intellectual property like patents for the sole purpose of monetizing their acquired intellectual property through asserting claims of infringement and misuse in addition some foreign competitors may take advantage of the intellectual property laws in their home countries and the more favorable litigation and regulatory environment to our detriment third party claims of infringement may result in loss of revenue substantial costs or lead to monetary damages or injunctive relief against us 

​ 

the company is subject to customer claims litigation and other regulatory or legal proceedings 

​ 

the company is currently engaged in or subject to various customer claims litigation and other regulatory and legal matters and may be subject to additional claims litigation and other regulatory or legal proceedings in the future such matters expose the company to risks that could be material including but not limited to risks related to employment disputes tax controversies government investigations intellectual property infringement compliance with environmental laws unfair sales practices product safety and liability and product warranty indemnity and other contractrelated claims these matters may subject the company to lawsuits voluntary or forced product recalls government investigations and criminal liability including claims for compensatory punitive or consequential damages and could result in disruptions to our business and significant legal expense s these matters could also damage our reputation harm our relationships with customers or negatively affect product demand 

​ 

while the company does maintain certain insurance coverages that may mitigate losses associated with some of these types of claims and proceedings the policies may not respond and where insurance exists the amount of insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the total claims and liabilities in some cases particularly with respect to product warranty claims from customers we selfinsure against this risk meaning that any product liability claims will likely have to be paid from company funds and not by insurance any current or future substantial liabilities or regulatory actions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows and reputation

​ 

the company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that could adversely affect our business 

​ 

the company operates in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions and we must comply with locally enacted laws and regulations addressing health safety and environmental matters in such jurisdictions in which we manufacture andor sell our products certain operations of the company are subject to locally enacted environmental laws and regulations that govern the discharge of pollutants into the air and water as well as the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes the company and its operations may be subject to liabilities regardless of fault for investigative andor remediation efforts on such matters that may arise at any of the company’s former or current properties either owned or leased for example as disclosed in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements the company was named as one of several defendants in four separate lawsuits filed in the state of indiana relating to a manufacturing site in franklin indiana where the company has been conducting an environmental cleanup effort under the direction of the united states environmental protection agency all the costs incurred by the company relating to these lawsuits as well as all costs associated with the cleanup effort at the manufacturing site have been reimbursed by the former owner pursuant to an indemnification agreement entered into in connection with the acquisition of the manufacturing site as part of a larger acquisition that led to the establishment of the company’s 

business in 1987 environmental liabilities can result from the use of hazardous materials in production the disposal of products damages associated with the use of any of our products or other related matters we cannot be certain as to the potential impact of any changes to environmental conditions or environmental policies that may arise in any of our jurisdictions our failure to comply with these local environmental laws and regulations could result in fines or other punitive damages andor modifications to our production processes as well as subject us to reputational harm any of which could adversely impact our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

​ 

the company may be subject to incremental costs and risks associated with efforts to combat the negative effects of climate change 

​ 

there continues to be an increased global focus on climate change issues which has led to international treaties and agreements and legislative and regulatory efforts in addition to the risks discussed under the heading “ the company may be negatively impacted by extreme weather conditions and natural catastrophic events including those caused by climate change and global warming ” the company may also be subject to larger global climate change initiatives laws regulations or orders for example in early 2021 the united states rejoined the paris climate agreement an international treaty focused on climate change with several goals including but not limited to the reduction of greenhouse gas “ghg” emissions more recently in late 2021 the united states participated in the 2021 united national climate change conference “cop26” at the cop26 participating countries agreed on a new climate changefocused deal the glasgow climate pact which marks the firstever climate deal to explicitly commit to a reduction in coal use the cop26 also resulted in many countries pledging to end deforestation and reduce methane emissions among other pledges 

​ 

given our global manufacturing presence any future increased regulation surrounding ghg emissions and other climate changerelated laws and regulations beyond initiatives already in process at the company could subject us to additional andor unforeseen compliance costs and limitations including increased energy and raw material costs and capital expenditures any future regulatory changes in any of the countries in which we operate could result in transition risks to the company including but not limited to i the nature and timing of any requirement to lower ghg emissions and adopt more energyefficient energy use which could result in changes or disruptions to the way the company operates ii financial risks where the compliance with such regulations requires unforeseen capital expenditures and becomes costly or financially burdensome iii legal risks associated with the failure to adapt to or comply with future climate changerelated regulations iv risks associated with the implementation of any new technologies required to comply with such regulations which could impede our ability to innovate new products meet customer and market demand or compete on pricing and quality in the market andor v reputational risks associated with our customers’ and investors’ perceptions of the company and their preferences for maintaining relationships with companies with lower emissions all of which could harm our reputation in the marketplace we are not able to predict how any future definitive agreements pacts andor regulations if and when they are adopted and required and the commitments necessary to comply with such requirements will affect our reputation business operations financial condition liquidity or results of operations in the future

​ 

​ 

critical accounting estimates 

​ 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period management bases its estimates on historical experience along with other assumptions that we believe are reasonable in formulating our bases for making judgements regarding the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent elsewhere estimates are adjusted as new information becomes available actual results could differ from those estimates the company believes that the following accounting policies and estimates are most critical since they require significant assumptions and judgments that inherently are subject to risks and uncertainties the significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

​ 

revenue recognition 

​ 

topic 606 

​ 

the company’s net sales in the consolidated statements of income for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 are presented under accounting standards update “asu” no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 collectively with its related subsequent amendments “topic 606” the company’s primary source of revenues consist of product sales to either end customers and their appointed contract manufacturers including original equipment manufacturers or to distributors our revenues are derived from contracts with customers which in most cases are customer purchase orders that may be governed by master sales agreements for each contract the promise to transfer the control of the products each of which is individually distinct is considered to be the identified performance obligation as part of the consideration promised in each contract the company evaluates the customer’s credit risk our contracts do not have any significant financing components as payment terms are generally due net 30 to 120 days after delivery although products are almost always sold at fixed prices in determining the transaction price we evaluate whether the price is subject to refund due to returns or adjustment due to volume discounts rebates or price concessions to determine the net consideration we expect to be entitled to we allocate the transaction price to each distinct product based on its relative standalone selling price taxes assessed by governmental authorities and collected from the customer including but not limited to sales and use taxes and valueadded taxes are not included in the transaction price 

​ 

the vast majority of our sales are recognized at a pointintime under the core principle of recognizing revenue when control transfers to the customer which generally occurs when we ship or deliver the product from our manufacturing facility to our customers when our customer accepts and has legal title of the goods and where the company has a present right to payment for such goods based on the respective contract terms most of our contracts’ revenues are recognized either i upon shipment based on free on board “fob” shipping point or ii when the product arrives at its destination for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 less than 5 of our net sales were recognized over time where the associated contracts relate to the sale of goods with no alternative use as they are only sold to a single customer and whose underlying contract terms provide the company with an enforceable right to payment including a reasonable profit margin for performance completed to date in the event of customer termination for the contracts recognized over time we typically record revenue using the input method based on the materials and labor costs incurred to date relative to the contract’s total estimated costs this method reasonably depicts when and as control of the goods transfers to the customer since it measures our progress in producing the goods which is generally commensurate with this transfer of control since we typically invoice our customers at the same time that we satisfy our performance obligations contract assets and contract liabilities related to our contracts with customers recorded in the consolidated balance sheets were not material as of december 31 2021 and 2020 

​ 

standard product warranty coverage which provides assurance that our products will conform to the contractually agreedupon specifications for a limited period from the date of shipment is typically offered while extended or separately priced warranty coverage is typically not offered the warranty claim is generally limited to a credit equal to the purchase price or a promise to repair or replace the product for a specified period of time at no additional charge we estimate our warranty liability based on historical experience product history and current trends 

​ 

income taxes 

​ 

deferred income taxes are provided for revenue and expenses which are recognized in different periods for income tax and financial statement reporting purposes the company recognizes the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on deferred income taxes in the period in which legislation is enacted deferred income taxes are provided on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries in the period in which the company determines it no longer intends to permanently reinvest such earnings outside the united states as of december 31 2021 the company has not provided for deferred income taxes on undistributed foreign earnings of approximately 1000 related to certain geographies as it is the company’s intention to permanently reinvest such earnings outside the united states it is impracticable to calculate the amount of taxes that would be payable if these undistributed foreign earnings were to be repatriated in addition the company remains indefinitely reinvested with respect to its financial statement basis in excess of tax basis of its investments in foreign subsidiaries it is not practicable to determine the deferred tax liability with respect to such basis differences deferred tax assets are regularly assessed for recoverability based on both historical and anticipated earnings levels and a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that these amounts will not be recovered 

​ 

the tax effects of an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns are recognized only if it is “more likely than not” to be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on its technical merits as of the reporting date the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement the company includes estimated interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes

​ 

as a result of the tax act the global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” provision imposed a tax on certain earnings o f foreign subsidiaries the company elected an accounting policy to account for gilti as a period cost the us treasury department has issued final interpretive guidance relating to certain provisions of the tax act and proposed additional guidance related to the same provisions the company will account for the impact of additional guidance in the period in which any new guidance is released if appropriate

​ 

any borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at rates that fluctuate with a spread that varies based on the company’s debt rating over certain currencyspecific benchmark rates which benchmark rates in the case of us dollar borrowings are either the base rate or the adjusted term secured overnight financing rate “sofr” any borrowings under the commercial paper programs are subject to floating interest rates therefore when the company borrows under these debt instruments the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates as of december 31 2021 approximately 804 or 17 of the company’s outstan ding borrowings primarily under the us commercial paper program were subject to floating interest rates the company’s weighted average floating rate on borrowings under the us commercial paper program as of december 31 2021 was 029 as of december 31 2020 there were no outstanding borrowings under the us commercial paper program as of december 31 2021 and 2020 there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and euro commercial paper program a 10 change in the interest rate at december 31 2021 and 2020 under our revolving credit facility or commercial paper programs would not have a material effect on interest expense the company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2022 although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not change significantly

​ 

risks related to our global operations 

​ 

nonus markets form a substantial portion of the company’s business and as a result the company is more exposed to political economic military and other risks in countries outside the united states 

​ 

during 2020 nonus markets constituted approximately 71 of the company’s net sales with china constituting approximately 30 of the company’s net sales the company employs approximately 90 of its workforce outside the united states the company’s customers are located throughout the world and the company has many manufacturing administrative and sales facilities outside the united states as a result our financial results and our operations including our ability to manufacture assemble and test design develop or sell products and the demand for our products may be adversely affected by a number of global and regional factors outside of our control because the company has extensive nonus operations as well as significant cash and cash investments held at institutions located outside of the united states it is exposed to additional risks that could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition results of operations or cash flows including 

​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

international trade or other disputes may result in increased tariffs trade barriers retaliatory governmental regulations or actions and other protectionist measures that could increase our manufacturing costs make our products less competitive reduce consumer demand or impede or slow the movement of our goods across borders increasing protectionism and economic nationalism may lead to further changes in trade policy domestic sourcing initiatives or other formal and informal measures that could make it more difficult to sell our products in some markets

​ 

changes in general economic conditions geopolitical conditions us trade policies and other factors beyond the company’s control may adversely impact our business and operating results 

​ 

the company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global regional and us economic and geopolitical conditions in recent years there have been significant changes to us trade policies legislation treaties and tariffs in particular trade policies and tariffs affecting china some of these trade policies including the us’s trading relationship with china have been renegotiated during this timeframe and are subject to further changes in the future changes to current policies by the us or other governments could affect our business including potentially through increased import tariffs and other influences on us trade relations with china and other countries the imposition of additional tariffs or other trade barriers could increase our costs in certain markets and may cause our 

customers to find alternative sourcing in addition other countries have changed and may continue to change their own policies on trade as well as business and foreign investment in their respective countries additionally it is possible that us policy changes and uncertainty about such changes could increase market volatility and currency exchange rate fluctuations market volatility and currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows as a result of these dynamics we cannot predict the impact to our business of any future changes to the us’s trading relationships or of new laws or regulations by the us or other countries 

​ 

in addition to changes in us trade policy a number of other economic and geopolitical factors both in the united states and abroad could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition results of operations or cash flows such as

​ 

 ​ 

we face significant risks related to adverse public health developments including epidemics and pandemics such as the covid19 pandemic 

​ 

any outbreaks of contagious diseases and other adverse public health developments in countries where we operate could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition liquidity and results of operations for example the covid19 pandemic has affected our manufacturing facilities throughout the world as well as the facilities of our suppliers customers and our customers’ contract manufacturers the covid19 pandemic has caused widespread disruptions to our company throughout most of 2020 particularly during the first half of the year during the first quarter of 2020 these disruptions were primarily limited to our operations in china which were closed for three weeks during january and february due to government mandates as the virus spread to the rest of the world beginning in march and continuing throughout the remainder of 2020 most of our other operations outside of china were also impacted as of december 31 2020 we continue to experience some disruptions and at a minimum we expect those disruptions to continue through the first half of 2021 and they could potentially extend for the full year and beyond these disruptions have included and may continue to include depending on the specific location government regulations that limit our ability to operate certain of our facilities at full capacity and to adjust certain costs travel restrictions “workfromhome” orders supplier constraints supplychain interruptions logistics challenges and limitations and reduced demand from certain customers the extent to which the covid19 pandemic will continue to impact our business and financial results going forward will be dependent on future developments such as the length and severity of the crisis future government regulations and actions in response to the crisis the timing availability and effectiveness of vaccines some of which have recently been approved and distributed for use and the overall impact of the covid19 pandemic on the global economy and capital markets among many other factors all of which remain highly uncertain and unpredictable in addition the covid19 pandemic could impact the health of our management team and other employees it is impossible to predict the overall future impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business financial condition liquidity and financial results and there can be no assurance that the covid19 pandemic will not have a material and adverse effect on our financial results in the future during any quarter or period in which we are affected 

​ 

in addition the covid19 pandemic increases the likelihood and potential severity of other risks including some discussed separately within this item 1a risk factors  including but not limited to the following

​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

our international operations require us to comply with anticorruption laws and regulations of the us government and various foreign jurisdictions and our business reputation and financial results may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees customers suppliers distributors or any other business partners 

​ 

doing business on a worldwide basis requires us and our subsidiaries to comply with the laws and regulations of the us government and various foreign jurisdictions and our failure to comply with these rules and regulations may expose us to significant liabilities these laws and regulations may apply to companies individual directors officers employees subcontractors and agents and may restrict our operations trade practices investment decisions and partnering activities in particular our international operations are subject to us and foreign anticorruption laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 as amended “fcpa” the fcpa prohibits us companies and their officers directors employees and agents acting on their behalf from corruptly offering promising authorizing or providing anything of value to foreign officials for the purposes of influencing official decisions or obtaining or retaining business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment the fcpa also requires companies to make and keep books records and accounts that accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets and to maintain a system of adequate internal accounting controls as part of our business we deal with stateowned business enterprises the employees and representatives of which may be considered foreign officials for purposes of the fcpa in addition some of the foreign locations in which we operate lack a developed legal system and have elevated levels of corruption as a result of the above activities we are exposed to the risk of violating anticorruption laws 

​ 

we have established policies and procedures designed to assist us and our personnel in complying with applicable us and international laws and regulations however there can be no assurance that these policies will be effective in preventing our directors officers employees subcontractors and agents from taking actions that violate these legal requirements violations of these legal requirements could subject us to criminal fines and imprisonment civil penalties disgorgement of profits injunctions debarment from government contracts and other remedial measures in addition any actual or alleged violations could disrupt our operations cause reputational harm involve significant management distraction and result in a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

​ 

the company’s results have at times been negatively affected by foreign currency exchange rates 

​ 

the company conducts business in many foreign currencies through its worldwide operations and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies including possible currency devaluations changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the company’s sales operating 

margins and equity the company manages currency exposure risk in a number of ways including producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency cost reduction and pricing actions working capital management and hedging contracts however there can be no assurance that these actions will be fully effective in managing currency risk including in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the foreign currencies of the company’s worldwide operations which could have an adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

​ 

the company has at times experienced difficulties in obtaining a consistent supply of materials at stable pricing levels 

​ 

the company uses basic materials like aluminum steel copper titanium metal alloys gold silver palladium and plastic resins in its manufacturing processes as well as a variety of components and relies on third party suppliers to secure these materials volatility in the prices of such materials and availability of supply may have a substantial impact on the price the company pays for such materials in addition the company may not be able to pass along increased raw material or component prices to its customers consequently our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

​ 

in limited instances we depend on a single source of supply or participate in commodity markets that may be served by a limited number of suppliers delays in obtaining supplies may result from a number of factors affecting our suppliers and any delay could impair our ability to deliver products to our customers for example the covid19 pandemic initially disrupted the supply of raw materials primarily in the first half of 2020 reoccurrences of such unforeseen events may result in the company experiencing difficulties in obtaining a consistent supply of materials at stable pricing levels accordingly such delays and associated risks could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

​ 

risks related to our end markets 

​ 

the company is dependent on the communications industry including information technology and data communications wireless communications and broadband communications 

​ 

approximately 46 of the company’s 2020 net sales came from sales to the communications industry including information technology and data communication wireless communications and broadband communications with 15 of the company’s 2020 net sales coming from sales to the mobile devices market demand for these products is subject to rapid technological change these markets are dominated by several large manufacturers and operators who regularly exert significant pressure on their suppliers including the company furthermore there has been a trend on the part of customers to consolidate their lists of qualified suppliers to companies that have the ability to meet certain technical quality delivery and other standards while maintaining competitive prices there can be no assurance that the company will be able to meet these standards or maintain competitive pricing and therefore continue to compete successfully in the communications industry the company’s failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

​ 

approximately 4 and 6 of the company’s 2020 net sales came from sales to the broadband communications and mobile networks markets respectively demand for the company’s products in these markets depends primarily on capital spending by operators for constructing rebuilding or upgrading their systems the amount of this capital spending and therefore the company’s sales and profitability will be affected by a variety of factors including general economic conditions consolidation within the communications industry the financial condition of operators and their access to financing competition technological developments new legislation and regulation of operators there can be no assurance that existing levels of capital spending will continue or that spending will not decrease 

​ 

changes in defense expenditures may reduce the company’s sales 

​ 

approximately 12 of the company’s 2020 net sales came from sales to the military market the company participates in a broad spectrum of defense programs the company’s military sales are generally to contractors and subcontractors of the us or foreign governments or to distributors that in turn sell to the contractors and subcontractors accordingly the company’s sales are affected by changes in the defense budgets of the us and foreign governments a significant decline in us or foreign government defense expenditures could have an adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations us and foreign government expenditures are also subject to 

political and budgetary fluctuations and constraints which may result in significant unexpected changes in levels of demand for our products 

​ 

the company is dependent on the acceptance of new product introductions for continued revenue growth 

​ 

the company estimates that products introduced in the last two years accounted for approximately 25 of 2020 net sales the company’s longterm results of operations depend substantially upon its ability to continue to conceive design manufacture and market new products and upon continuing market acceptance of its existing and future product lines in the ordinary course of business the company continually develops or creates new product line concepts if the company fails or is significantly delayed in introducing new product line concepts or if the company’s new products are not met with market acceptance its business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

​ 

the company encounters competition in substantially all areas of its business 

​ 

the company competes primarily on the basis of technology innovation product quality and performance price customer service and delivery time competitors include large diversified companies some of which have greater assets and financial resources than the company as well as medium to smallsized companies in addition rapid technological changes occurring in the communications industry could also lead to the entry of new competitors of all sizes against whom we may not be able to successfully compete there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against existing or new competition and the inability to do so may result in price reductions reduced margins or loss of market share any of which could have an adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

​ 

risks related to acquisitions 

​ 

the company has at times experienced difficulties and unanticipated expenses in connection with purchasing and integrating newly acquired businesses 

​

​ 

on december 9 2020 the company announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire mts systems corporation “mts” for 5850 per share in cash or approximately 17 billion net of cash acquired and including the assumption of outstanding debt and liabilities on january 19 2021 the company announced that we had entered into an agreement to sell the mts test  simulation “ts” business to illinois tool works inc “itw” the agreement to acquire mts is expected to close by the middle of 2021 but is subject to certain regulatory approvals approval from mts’s shareholders and other customary closing conditions the sale of the mts ts business to itw is expected to close following the anticipated closing of our acquisition of mts but is also subject to certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions the acquisition of mts and the sale of the mts ts business to itw are subject to a number of risks that include but are not limited to i the risk that the proposed merger between amphenol and mts andor the proposed subsequent sale of the mts ts business to itw may not be completed in a timely manner or at all ii unanticipated difficulties or expenditures relating to the proposed transactions the response of business partners and competitors to the announcement of the proposed transactions potential disruptions to current plans and operations andor potential difficulties in employee retention as a result of the announcement and pendency of the proposed transactions and iii the failure of the transactions if completed to deliver the financial benefits to amphenol currently anticipated by the amphenol management team 

​ 

the company may in the future incur goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges 

​ 

at december 31 2020 the total assets of the company were 123 billion which included 50 billion of goodwill the excess of fair value of consideration paid over the fair value of net identifiable assets of businesses acquired and 3975 million of other intangible assets net the company performs annual evaluations or more frequently if necessary for the potential impairment of the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets such evaluations to date have not resulted in the need to recognize an impairment however if the financial performance of the company’s businesses were to decline significantly the company could incur a material noncash charge to its income statement for the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets furthermore we cannot provide assurance that impairment charges in the future will not be required if the expected cash flow estimates as projected by management do not occur especially if an economic recession occurs and continues for a lengthy period or becomes severe or if acquisitions and investments made by the company fail to achieve expected returns 

​ 

risks related to our liquidity and capital resources 

​ 

the company’s credit agreements contain certain covenants which if breached could have a material adverse effect on the company 

​ 

the credit agreement as amended and restated effective january 15 2019 among the company certain subsidiaries of the company and a syndicate of financial institutions the “revolving credit facility” which also backstops the company’s us commercial paper program “us commercial paper program” and euro commercial paper program contains financial and other covenants such as a limit on the ratio of debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization a limit on priority indebtedness and limits on incurrence of liens although the company believes none of these covenants is presently restrictive to the company’s operations the ability to meet the financial covenants can be affected by events beyond the company’s control and the company cannot provide assurance that it will meet those tests a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the revolving credit facility upon the occurrence of an event of default under any of the company’s credit facilities the lenders could terminate all commitments to extend further credit and elect to declare amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable which could result in the acceleration of certain of the company’s other indebtedness and the company not having sufficient assets to repay the revolving credit facility and such other indebtedness as of december 31 2020 the company had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility us commercial paper program and euro commercial paper program 

​ 

the company relies on the capital markets and its inability to access those markets on favorable terms could adversely affect the company’s results 

​ 

the company has used the capital markets to invest in its business and make strategic acquisitions if general economic and capital market conditions deteriorate significantly it could impact the company’s ability to access the capital markets while the company has not recently encountered any financing difficulties the capital and credit markets have experienced significant volatility in the past market conditions could make it more difficult to access capital to finance capital investments acquisitions and other initiatives including dividends and share repurchases as such this could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition results of operations or cash flows in addition while the company has not encountered any such issues to date if the credit rating agencies that rate the company’s debt were to downgrade the company’s credit rating in conjunction with a deterioration of the company’s performance it would likely increase the company’s cost of capital and make it more difficult for the company to obtain new financing and access capital markets which could also have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

​ 

the company’s results may be negatively affected by changing interest rates  

​

legal and regulatory risks 

​ 

our business and financial results may be adversely affected by government contracting risks 

​ 

we are subject to various laws and regulations applicable to parties doing business with the us government including laws and regulations governing performance of us government contracts the use and treatment of us government furnished property and the nature of materials used in our products we may be unilaterally suspended or barred from conducting business with the us government or its suppliers both directly and indirectly or become subject to fines or other sanctions if we are found to have violated such laws or regulations as a result of the need to comply with these laws and regulations we are subject to increased risks of governmental investigations civil fraud actions criminal prosecutions whistleblower lawsuits and other enforcement actions for example in august 2018 we received a subpoena from the us department of defense office of the inspector general requesting documents pertaining to certain products manufactured by the company’s military and aerospace group that are purchased or used by the us government as noted herein in item 3 legal proceedings and note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements the laws and regulations to which we are subject include but are not limited to export administration regulations the federal acquisition regulation the false claims act international traffic in arms regulations and regulations from the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms and the fcpa failure to comply with applicable requirements also could harm our reputation and our ability to compete for future government contracts or sell commercial equivalent products any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

​ 

in addition us government contracts are subject to modification curtailment or termination by the us government without prior written notice either for convenience or for default as a result of our failure to perform under the applicable contract if terminated by the us government as a result of our default we could be liable for additional costs the us government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages it suffers we are also prohibited from assigning prime us government contracts without the prior consent of the us government contracting officer furthermore the us government periodically audits our governmental contract costs which could result in fines penalties or adjustment of costs and prices under the contracts any such fines penalties or payment adjustments resulting from such audits could adversely affect our reputation business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

​ 

the company is subject to governmental export and import controls 

​ 

certain of our products including purchased components of such products are subject to export controls and may be exported only with the required export license or through an export license exception in addition we are required to comply with certain us and foreign sanctions and embargoes these laws and regulations are complex may change frequently and with limited notice have generally become more stringent over time and have intensified under recent us administrations especially in light of recent trade tensions with china for example in 2019 the us government added certain of the company’s customers based in china to its “entity list” which imposes additional restrictions on sales to such customers although such restrictions did not have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations the us government has the power to place even greater restrictions on these and other customers and such restrictions could prohibit the company from selling products to such customers if we were to fail to comply with these restrictions or applicable export licensing customs regulations economic sanctions and other laws we could be subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties including fines for us the incarceration of responsible employees and managers and the possible loss of export or import privileges in addition if our distributors fail to obtain appropriate import export or reexport licenses or permits we may also be adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties obtaining the necessary export license for a particular sale may be timeconsuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities 

​ 

cybersecurity incidents on our information technology systems could disrupt business operations or cause the release of highly sensitive confidential information resulting in adverse impacts to our reputation and operating results and potentially leading to litigation andor governmental investigations 

​ 

cybersecurity threats continue to expand and evolve globally making it difficult to detect and prevent such threats from impacting the company while the company has been a target of various cybersecurity attacks including but not limited to ransomware attacks the impact of such attacks has not been material cybersecurity threats to the company could lead to unauthorized access to the company’s information technology systems products customers suppliers and third party service providers cybersecurity incidents could potentially result in the disruption of our business operations andor the misappropriation destruction or corruption of critical data and confidential or proprietary information cybersecurity events could also result in the company being unable to access critical data in a timely manner or at all cybersecurity incidents could also result from unauthorized parties gaining access to our systems or information through fraudulent or other means of deceiving our employees suppliers or third party service providers in addition the ongoing covid19 pandemic may increase our susceptibility to cybersecurity incidents and risks especially as certain of our employees have transitioned and continue to work from home despite the company’s implementation of preventative security measures to prevent detect address and mitigate these threats our infrastructure may still be susceptible to disruptions from cybersecurity incidents ransomware attacks security breaches computer viruses outages systems failures natural disasters adverse public health developments or other catastrophic events any of which could include reputational damage loss of our intellectual property release of highly sensitive confidential information the inability to access critical data litigation with third parties andor governmental investigations among other things which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

​ 

we and our business partners maintain significant amounts of data electronically in locations around the world this data relates to all aspects of our business including financial information and current and future products under development and also contains certain customer supplier partner and employee data we maintain systems and processes designed to protect this data but notwithstanding such protective measures there is a risk of intrusion cyber attacks or tampering that could compromise the integrity and privacy of this data or make the data inaccessible to us in addition in certain cases in order to conduct business we outsource to thirdparty business partners we obtain assurances from those parties that they have systems and processes in place to protect our data and where applicable that they will take steps to assure the protection of our data nonetheless those partners may also be subject to data intrusion or a cyber attack any compromise of the data could substantially disrupt our operations harm our customers employees and other business partners damage our reputation violate applicable laws and regulations and subject us to potentially significant costs and liabilities

​ 

the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding with frequent imposition of new and changing requirements for example the european unions general data protection regulation “gdpr” which became effective in may 2018 and the state of california’s california consumer privacy act “ccpa” which became effective january 1 2020 impose significant new requirements and additional obligations for companies on how they collect process and transfer personal data by enhancing consumer privacy rights and imposing significant fines for noncompliance the potential for fines and other related costs in the event of a breach of or non 

compliance with the gdpr ccpa or other existing or proposed information security or privacy laws and requirements may have an adverse effect on our financial results 

​ 

changes in fiscal and tax policies audits and examinations by taxing authorities could impact the company’s results 

​ 

the company is subject to tax in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions the company is currently under tax examination in several jurisdictions and in addition new examinations could be initiated by additional tax authorities as the company has operations in jurisdictions throughout the world the risk of tax examinations will continue to occur the company’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows may be materially impacted by the results of these tax examinations 

​ 

any future changes in tax laws regulations accounting standards for income taxes andor other tax guidance including related interpretations could materially impact the company’s current and noncurrent tax liabilities along with deferred tax assets and liabilities and consequently our financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

​ 

the company relies on patent and trade secret laws copyright trademark confidentiality procedures controls and contractual commitments to protect our intellectual property rights 

​ 

we rely on patent and trade secret laws copyright trademark confidentiality procedures controls and contractual commitments to protect our intellectual property rights despite our efforts these protections may be limited and we may encounter difficulties in protecting our intellectual property rights particularly in certain countries outside the us we cannot provide assurance that the patents that we hold or may obtain will provide meaningful protection against our competitors changes in national or international laws concerning intellectual property may affect our ability to prevent or address the misappropriation of or the unauthorized use of our intellectual property potentially resulting in loss of market share litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights litigation is inherently uncertain and outcomes are often unpredictable if we cannot protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized copying or use or other misappropriation we may not remain competitive 

​ 

the company is subject to customer claims litigation and other regulatory or legal proceedings 

​ 

the company is currently engaged in or subject to various customer claims litigation and other regulatory and legal matters and may be subject to additional claims litigation and other regulatory or legal proceedings in the future such matters expose the company to risks that could be material including but not limited to risks related to employment disputes tax controversies government investigations intellectual property infringement compliance with environmental laws unfair sales practices product safety and liability and product warranty indemnity and other contractrelated claims these matters may subject the company to lawsuits product recalls government investigations and criminal liability including claims for compensatory punitive or consequential damages and could result in disruptions to our business and significant legal expense s these matters could also damage our reputation harm our relationships with customers or negatively affect product demand while the company does maintain certain insurance coverages that may mitigate losses associated with some of these types of claims and proceedings the policies may not respond in all cases and where insurance exists the amount of insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the total claims and liabilities  any current or future substantial liabilities or regulatory actions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows and reputation 

​

connection with the acquisition of the manufacturing site as part of a larger acquisition that led to the establishment of the company’s business in 1987 environmental liabilities can result from the use of hazardous materials in production the disposal of products damages associated with the use of any of our products or other related matters we cannot be certain as to the potential impact of any changes to environmental conditions or environmental policies that may arise at any of our jurisdictions our failure to comply with these local environmental laws and regulations could result in fines or other punitive damages andor modifications to our production processes as well as subject us to reputational harm any of which could adversely impact our financial position results of operations or cash flows

the covid19 pandemic has caused widespread disruptions to our company during 2020 particularly during the first half of the year during the first quarter these disruptions were primarily limited to our operations in china which were closed for three weeks during january and february due to government mandates as the virus spread to the rest of the world beginning in march and continuing throughout the remainder of 2020 most of our other operations outside of china were also impacted as of december 31 2020 we continue to experience some disruptions and at a minimum we expect those disruptions to continue through the first half of 2021 and they could potentially extend for the full year and beyond these disruptions have included and may continue to include depending on the specific location government regulations that limit our ability to operate certain of our facilities at full capacity and to adjust certain costs travel restrictions “workfromhome” orders supplier constraints supplychain interruptions logistics challenges and limitations and reduced demand from certain customers during the fourth quarter of 2020 and into 2021 in several regions around the world including the united states and europe there has been a resurgence in covid19 cases the extent to which the covid19 pandemic will continue to impact our business and financial results going forward will be dependent on future developments such as the length and severity of the crisis future government regulations and actions in response to the crisis the timing availability and effectiveness of vaccines some of which have recently been approved and distributed for use and the overall impact of the covid19 pandemic on the global economy and capital markets among many other factors all of which remain highly uncertain and unpredictable in addition the covid19 pandemic could impact the health of our management team and other employees the company continues taking actions to mitigate as best we can the impact of the covid19 pandemic on the health and wellbeing of our employees the communities in which we operate and our partners as well as the impact on our operations and business as a whole however there can be no assurance that the covid19 pandemic will not have a material and adverse impact on our operations financial condition liquidity and results of operations for further discussion on the risks and uncertainties associated with the covid19 pandemic refer to part i item 1a risk factors

2020 compared to 2019 

​ 

net sales were 85989 for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to 82254 for the year ended december 31 2019 which was an increase of 5 in us dollars 4 in constant currencies and 2 organically excluding both currency and acquisition impacts over the prior year the increase in net sales in 2020 was driven by strong growth in several markets which was partially offset by the sudden and severe slowdown in certain of our markets resulting from the global outbreak of the covid19 pandemic which also caused production disruptions in many parts of the world during much of the first half of 2020 

​ 

net sales in the interconnect products and assemblies segment approximately 96 of net sales increased 5 in us dollars 4 in constant currencies and 2 organically in 2020 compared to 2019 the sales growth was driven by strong growth in the industrial information technology and data communications and mobile devices markets along with moderate growth in the military market and contributions from the company’s acquisition program this sales growth was partially offset by declines in the commercial aerospace mobile networks and automotive markets all of which were negatively impacted by the covid19 pandemic net sales to the industrial market increased approximately 2464 primarily driven by strength in battery and electric vehicle industrial instrumentation heavy equipment alternative energy and medical applications along with contributions from acquisitions net sales to the information technology and data communications market increased approximately 2340 driven primarily by strong sales growth to data center customers and market demand for storage and networking related products as customers worked to support higher demand for increased bandwidth to support work school and entertainment activities during the pandemic along with contributions from acquisitions net sales to the mobile devices market increased approximately 1799 driven by strength in products incorporated into laptops tablets wearable devices and accessories along with productionrelated products which was partially offset by a slight moderation of sales into smartphones net sales to the military market increased approximately 322 driven by strength across multiple segments of the military market offset in part by the impact of pandemicrelated production disruptions experienced during the first half of the year net sales to the commercial aerospace market decreased significantly approximately 1353 primarily due to the significant impact of the covid19 pandemic on travel and aircraft production net sales to the mobile networks market decreased approximately 985 which reflected the impact of the 2019 us government restrictions on certain chinese customers as well as reduced demand from both mobile networks equipment manufacturers and mobile operators partially as a result of the negative impact of the covid19 pandemic offset in part by contributions from acquisitions net sales to the automotive market decreased approximately 860 due to a significant reduction in demand resulting from customer factory shutdowns together with production disruptions in the first half of 2020 resulting from the covid19 pandemic which was partially offset by a strong recovery of demand during the second half of the year 

​ 

net sales in the cable products and solutions segment approximately 4 of net sales which primarily serves the broadband communications market decreased 4 in us dollars 1 in constant currencies and 1 organically in 2020 compared to 2019 the decrease in net sales in the cable products and solutions segment was largely driven by the 

negative impact of the covid19 pandemic primarily during the first half of 2020 as well as an overall weakness in market demand

​ 

operating income for the cable products and solutions segment in 2020 was 354 or 96 of net sales compared to 395 or 102 of net sales in 2019 the decrease in operating margin for the cable products and solutions segment in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily driven by lower volumes as well as the negative impact of the covid19 pandemic primarily during the first half of 2020

critical accounting policies and estimates 

​ 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period management bases its estimates on historical experience along with other assumptions that we believe are reasonable in formulating our bases for making judgements regarding the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent elsewhere estimates are adjusted as new information becomes available actual results could differ from those estimates the company believes that the most significant areas involving critical accounting policies are set forth below the significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

​ 

revenue recognition 

​ 

topic 606 

​ 

the company’s net sales in the consolidated statements of income for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 are presented under accounting standards update “asu” no 201409 revenue from contracts with 

customers topic 606 collectively with its related subsequent amendments “topic 606” resulting from the modified retrospective adoption of topic 606 applied to those contracts which were not completed as of january 1 2018 

​ 

the company’s primary source of revenues consist of product sales to either end customers and their appointed contract manufacturers including original equipment manufacturers or to distributors our revenues are derived from contracts with customers which in most cases are customer purchase orders that may be governed by master sales agreements for each contract the promise to transfer the control of the products each of which is individually distinct is considered to be the identified performance obligation as part of the consideration promised in each contract the company evaluates the customer’s credit risk our contracts do not have any significant financing components as payment terms are generally due net 30 to 120 days after delivery although products are almost always sold at fixed prices in determining the transaction price we evaluate whether the price is subject to refund due to returns or adjustment due to volume discounts rebates or price concessions to determine the net consideration we expect to be entitled to we allocate the transaction price to each distinct product based on its relative standalone selling price taxes assessed by governmental authorities and collected from the customer including but not limited to sales and use taxes and valueadded taxes are not included in the transaction price 

​ 

the vast majority of our sales are recognized at a pointintime under the core principle of recognizing revenue when control transfers to the customer which generally occurs when we ship or deliver the product from our manufacturing facility to our customers when our customer accepts and has legal title of the goods and where the company has a present right to payment for such goods based on the respective contract terms most of our contracts’ revenues are recognized either i upon shipment based on free on board “fob” shipping point ii when the product arrives at its destination or iii when the products are pulled from consignment inventory for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 less than 5 of our net sales were recognized over time where the associated contracts relate to the sale of goods with no alternative use as they are only sold to a single customer and whose underlying contract terms provide the company with an enforceable right to payment including a reasonable profit margin for performance completed to date in the event of customer termination for the contracts recognized over time we typically record revenue using the input method based on the materials and labor costs incurred to date relative to the contract’s total estimated costs this method reasonably depicts when and as control of the goods transfers to the customer since it measures our progress in producing the goods which is generally commensurate with this transfer of control since we typically invoice our customers at the same time that we satisfy our performance obligations contract assets and contract liabilities related to our contracts with customers recorded in the consolidated balance sheets were not material as of december 31 2020 and 2019 

​

​ 

as a result of the tax act in 2017 the company recorded i a provisional income tax charge related to the deemed repatriation of the accumulated unremitted earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries ii a provisional income tax charge related to changes in the company’s permanent reinvestment assertion with regards to prior accumulated unremitted earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries partially offset by iii a provisional income tax benefit associated 

with the remeasurement of its net deferred tax liabilities due to the us federal corporate tax rate reduction and included these amounts in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2017 the accounting associated with each of the provisional amounts was completed in 2018 beginning in 2018 the global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” provision imposed a tax on certain earnings o f foreign subsidiaries the company elected an accounting policy to account for gilti as a period cost the us treasury department has issued final interpretive guidance relating to certain provisions of the tax act and proposed additional guidance related to the same provisions the company will account for the impact of additional guidance in the period in which any new guidance is released if appropriate

​ 

while there were no such outstanding borrowings as of december 31 2020 any borrowings under the revolving credit facility either bear interest at or trade at rates that fluctuate with a spread over libor and any borrowings under the commercial paper programs are subject to floating interest rates therefore when the company borrows under these debt instruments the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates as of december 31 2020 there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and commercial paper programs and therefore the amount of outstanding borrowings subject to floating interest rates was not material  as of december 31 2019 approximately 400 or 11 of the company’s outstan ding borrowings which related primarily to the company’s commercial paper programs were subject to floating interest rates the company’s average floating rate on borrowings under the us commercial paper program and euro commercial paper program as of december 31 2019 was 185 and 013 respectively a 10 change in the interest rate at december 31 2020 and 2019 under our revolving credit facility or commercial paper programs would not have a material effect on interest expense the company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2021 although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not change significantly

​ 

risks related to our global operations 

​ 

nonus markets form a substantial portion of the company’s business and as a result the company is more exposed to political economic military and other risks in countries outside the united states 

​ 

during 2019 nonus markets constituted approximately 69 of the company’s net sales with china constituting approximately 28 of the company’s net sales the company employs approximately 90 of its workforce outside the united states the company’s customers are located throughout the world and the company has many manufacturing administrative and sales facilities outside the united states as a result our financial results and our operations including our ability to manufacture assemble and test design develop or sell products and the demand for our products may be adversely affected by a number of global and regional factors outside of our control because the company has extensive nonus operations as well as significant cash and cash investments held at institutions located outside of the united states it is exposed to additional risks that could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition results of operations or cash flows including 

​ 

 ​ 

international trade disputes may result in increased tariffs trade barriers and other protectionist measures that could increase our manufacturing costs make our products less competitive reduce consumer demand or impede or slow the 

movement of our goods across borders increasing protectionism and economic nationalism may lead to further changes in trade policy domestic sourcing initiatives or other formal and informal measures that could make it more difficult to sell our products in some markets

​ 

changes in general economic conditions geopolitical conditions us trade policies and other factors beyond the company’s control may adversely impact our business and operating results 

​ 

the company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global regional and us economic and geopolitical conditions in recent years there has been discussion and dialogue regarding potential significant changes to us trade policies legislation treaties and tariffs in particular trade policies and tariffs affecting china some of these trade policies have been or are in the process of being renegotiated including the us’s trading relationship with china changes to current policies by the us or other governments could affect our business including potentially through increased import tariffs and other influences on us trade relations with china and other countries the imposition of additional tariffs or other trade barriers could increase our costs in certain markets and may cause our customers to find alternative sourcing in addition other countries may change their own policies on business and foreign investment in companies in their respective countries additionally it is possible that us policy changes and uncertainty about such changes could increase market volatility and currency exchange rate fluctuations market volatility and currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows as a result of these dynamics we cannot predict the impact to our business of any future changes to the us’s trading relationships 

​ 

in addition to changes in us trade policy a number of other economic and geopolitical factors both in the united states and abroad could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition results of operations or cash flows such as

​ 

 ​ 

we have significant international sales and operations and face risks related to health epidemics such as the coronavirus 

​ 

any outbreaks of contagious diseases and other adverse public health developments in countries where we operate could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations for example the recent outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus first identified in wuhan hubei province china has resulted in significant governmental measures being implemented to control the spread of the virus including restrictions on manufacturing and the movement of employees in many regions of the country this has affected our manufacturing facilities in china as well as the facilities of our suppliers customers and our customers’ contract manufacturers the extent to which the coronavirus will impact our business and our financial results will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted in addition the coronavirus may result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries resulting in an economic downturn 

that could affect demand for our end customers’ products as a result at the time of this filing it is impossible to predict the overall impact of the coronavirus on our business and financial results 

​ 

our international operations require us to comply with anticorruption laws and regulations of the us government and various foreign jurisdictions and our business reputation and financial results may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees customers suppliers distributors or any other business partners 

​ 

doing business on a worldwide basis requires us and our subsidiaries to comply with the laws and regulations of the us government and various foreign jurisdictions and our failure to comply with these rules and regulations may expose us to significant liabilities these laws and regulations may apply to companies individual directors officers employees subcontractors and agents and may restrict our operations trade practices investment decisions and partnering activities in particular our international operations are subject to us and foreign anticorruption laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 as amended “fcpa” the fcpa prohibits us companies and their officers directors employees and agents acting on their behalf from corruptly offering promising authorizing or providing anything of value to foreign officials for the purposes of influencing official decisions or obtaining or retaining business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment the fcpa also requires companies to make and keep books records and accounts that accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets and to maintain a system of adequate internal accounting controls as part of our business we deal with stateowned business enterprises the employees and representatives of which may be considered foreign officials for purposes of the fcpa in addition some of the foreign locations in which we operate lack a developed legal system and have elevated levels of corruption as a result of the above activities we are exposed to the risk of violating anticorruption laws 

​ 

we have established policies and procedures designed to assist us and our personnel in complying with applicable us and international laws and regulations however there can be no assurance that these policies will be effective in preventing our directors officers employees subcontractors and agents from taking actions that violate these legal requirements violations of these legal requirements could subject us to criminal fines and imprisonment civil penalties disgorgement of profits injunctions debarment from government contracts and other remedial measures in addition any actual or alleged violations could disrupt our operations cause reputational harm involve significant management distraction and result in a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

​ 

the company’s results have at times been negatively affected by foreign currency exchange rates 

​ 

the company conducts business in many foreign currencies through its worldwide operations and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies including possible currency devaluations changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the company’s sales operating margins and equity the company manages currency exposure risk in a number of ways including producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency cost reduction and pricing actions working capital management and hedging contracts however there can be no assurance that these actions will be fully effective in managing currency risk including in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the foreign currencies of the company’s worldwide operations which could have an adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

​ 

the company has at times experienced difficulties in obtaining a consistent supply of materials at stable pricing levels 

​ 

the company uses basic materials like aluminum steel copper titanium metal alloys gold silver palladium and plastic resins in its manufacturing processes as well as a variety of components and relies on third party suppliers to secure these materials volatility in the prices of such materials and availability of supply may have a substantial impact on the price the company pays for such materials in addition the company may not be able to pass along increased raw material or component prices to its customers consequently our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

​ 

in limited instances we depend on a single source of supply or participate in commodity markets that may be served by a limited number of suppliers delays in obtaining supplies may result from a number of factors affecting our suppliers and any delay could impair our ability to deliver products to our customers and accordingly could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition

​ 

risks related to our end markets

approximately 44 of the company’s 2019 net sales came from sales to the communications industry including information technology and data communication wireless communications and broadband communications with 13 of the company’s 2019 net sales coming from sales to the mobile devices market demand for these products is subject to rapid technological change these markets are dominated by several large manufacturers and operators who regularly exert significant pressure on their suppliers including the company furthermore there has been a trend on the part of customers to consolidate their lists of qualified suppliers to companies that have the ability to meet certain technical quality delivery and other standards while maintaining competitive prices there can be no assurance that the company will be able to meet these standards or maintain competitive pricing and therefore continue to compete successfully in the communications industry the company’s failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

​ 

approximately 4 and 8 of the company’s 2019 net sales came from sales to the broadband communications and mobile networks markets respectively demand for the company’s products in these markets depends primarily on capital spending by operators for constructing rebuilding or upgrading their systems the amount of this capital spending and therefore the company’s sales and profitability will be affected by a variety of factors including general economic conditions consolidation within the communications industry the financial condition of operators and their access to financing competition technological developments new legislation and regulation of operators there can be no assurance that existing levels of capital spending will continue or that spending will not decrease 

​ 

changes in defense expenditures may reduce the company’s sales 

​ 

approximately 12 of the company’s 2019 net sales came from sales to the military market the company participates in a broad spectrum of defense programs the company’s military sales are generally to contractors and subcontractors of the us or foreign governments or to distributors that in turn sell to the contractors and subcontractors accordingly the company’s sales are affected by changes in the defense budgets of the us and foreign governments a significant decline in us or foreign government defense expenditures could have an adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations us and foreign government expenditures are also subject to political and budgetary fluctuations and constraints which may result in significant unexpected changes in levels of demand for our products 

​ 

the company is dependent on the acceptance of new product introductions for continued revenue growth 

​ 

the company estimates that products introduced in the last two years accounted for approximately 25 of 2019 net sales the company’s longterm results of operations depend substantially upon its ability to continue to conceive design manufacture and market new products and upon continuing market acceptance of its existing and future product lines in the ordinary course of business the company continually develops or creates new product line concepts if the company fails or is significantly delayed in introducing new product line concepts or if the company’s new products are not met with market acceptance its business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

​ 

the company encounters competition in substantially all areas of its business 

​ 

the company competes primarily on the basis of technology innovation product quality and performance price customer service and delivery time competitors include large diversified companies some of which have greater assets and financial resources than the company as well as medium to smallsized companies in addition rapid technological changes occurring in the communications industry could also lead to the entry of new competitors of all sizes against whom we may not be able to successfully compete there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against existing or new competition and the inability to do so may result in price reductions reduced margins or loss of market share any of which could have an adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

​ 

​ 

risks related to acquisitions 

​ 

the company has at times experienced difficulties and unanticipated expenses in connection with purchasing and integrating newly acquired businesses 

​

​ 

the company may in the future incur goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges 

​ 

at december 31 2019 the total assets of the company were 108155 million which included 48671 million of goodwill the excess of fair value of consideration paid over the fair value of net identifiable assets of businesses acquired and 4420 million of other intangible assets net the company performs annual evaluations or more frequently if necessary for the potential impairment of the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets such evaluations to date have not resulted in the need to recognize an impairment however if the financial performance of the company’s businesses were to decline significantly the company could incur a material noncash charge to its income statement for the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets furthermore we cannot provide assurance that impairment charges in the future will not be required if the expected cash flow estimates as projected by management do not occur especially if an economic recession occurs and continues for a lengthy period or becomes severe or if acquisitions and investments made by the company fail to achieve expected returns 

​ 

risks related to our liquidity and capital resources 

​ 

the company’s credit agreements contain certain covenants which if breached could have a material adverse effect on the company 

​ 

the credit agreement as amended and restated effective january 15 2019 among the company certain subsidiaries of the company and a syndicate of financial institutions the “revolving credit facility” which also backstops the company’s us commercial paper program “us commercial paper program” and euro commercial paper program contains financial and other covenants such as a limit on the ratio of debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization a limit on priority indebtedness and limits on incurrence of liens although the company believes none of these covenants is presently restrictive to the company’s operations the ability to meet the financial covenants can be affected by events beyond the company’s control and the company cannot provide assurance that it will meet those tests a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the revolving credit facility upon the occurrence of an event of default under any of the company’s credit facilities the lenders could terminate all commitments to extend further credit and elect to declare amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable which could result in the acceleration of certain of the company’s other indebtedness and the company not having sufficient assets to repay the revolving credit facility and such other indebtedness as of december 31 2019 the company had outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility us commercial paper program and euro commercial paper program of nil 1600 million and 2355 million respectively 

​ 

the company relies on the capital markets and its inability to access those markets on favorable terms could adversely affect the company’s results 

​ 

the company has used the capital markets to invest in its business and make strategic acquisitions if general economic and capital market conditions deteriorate significantly it could impact the company’s ability to access the 

capital markets while the company has not recently encountered any financing difficulties the capital and credit markets have experienced significant volatility in the past market conditions could make it more difficult to access capital to finance capital investments acquisitions and other initiatives including dividends and share repurchases as such this could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition results of operations or cash flows in addition while the company has not encountered any such issues to date if the credit rating agencies that rate the company’s debt were to downgrade the company’s credit rating in conjunction with a deterioration of the company’s performance it would likely increase the company’s cost of capital and make it more difficult for the company to obtain new financing and access capital markets which could also have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

​ 

the company’s results may be negatively affected by changing interest rates  

​ 

the company is subject to interest rate volatility with regard to existing and future issuances of debt the company monitors its mix of fixedrate and variablerate debt as well as its mix of shortterm and longterm debt as of december 31 2019 approximately 400 million or 11 of the company’s outstanding borrowings were subject to floating interest rates and were primarily comprised of commercial paper borrowings a 10 change in the london interbank offered rate “libor” or floating interest rates at december 31 2019 would not have a material effect on the company’s interest expense the company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2020 although there can be no assurance that interest rates will not change significantly 

​ 

in 2017 the united kingdoms financial conduct authority which regulates libor announced its intent to phase out libor by the end of 2021 if libor ceases to exist or if the methods of calculating libor change from their current form interest rates on and the market price for our current or future indebtedness may be adversely affected refer to part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further discussion and details on this development

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period management bases its estimates on historical experience along with other assumptions that we believe are reasonable in formulating our bases for making judgements regarding the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent elsewhere estimates are adjusted as new information becomes available actual results could differ from those estimates the company believes that the most significant areas involving critical accounting policies are set forth below the significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 of the notes to the company’s consolidated financial statements

revenue recognition 

​ 

topic 606 

​ 

the company’s net sales in the consolidated statements of income for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 are presented under accounting standards update “asu” no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 collectively with its related subsequent amendments “topic 606” resulting from the modified retrospective adoption of topic 606 applied to those contracts which were not completed as of january 1 2018 the comparative results for the year ended december 31 2017 were recognized in accordance with the company’s revenue recognition policy then in effect under asc topic 605 revenue recognition “topic 605” as discussed below the adoption of topic 606 resulted in accounting policy changes surrounding revenue recognition which replaced previous revenue guidance under topic 605 

​ 

the company’s primary source of revenues consist of product sales to either end customers and their appointed contract manufacturers including original equipment manufacturers or to distributors our revenues are derived from contracts with customers which in most cases are customer purchase orders that may be governed by master sales agreements for each contract the promise to transfer the control of the products each of which is individually distinct is considered to be the identified performance obligation as part of the consideration promised in each contract the company evaluates the customer’s credit risk our contracts do not have any significant financing components as payment terms are generally due net 30 to 120 days after delivery although products are almost always sold at fixed prices in determining the transaction price we evaluate whether the price is subject to refund due to returns or adjustment due to volume discounts rebates or price concessions to determine the net consideration we expect to be entitled to we allocate the transaction price to each distinct product based on its relative standalone selling price taxes assessed by governmental authorities and collected from the customer including but not limited to sales and use taxes and valueadded taxes are not included in the transaction price 

​ 

the vast majority of our sales are recognized at a pointintime under the core principle of recognizing revenue when control transfers to the customer which generally occurs when we ship or deliver the product from our manufacturing facility to our customers when our customer accepts and has legal title of the goods and where the company has a present right to payment for such goods based on the respective contract terms most of our contracts’ revenues are recognized either i upon shipment based on free on board “fob” shipping point ii when the product arrives at its destination or iii when the products are pulled from consignment inventory for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 less than 5 of our net sales were recognized over time where the associated contracts relate to the sale of goods with no alternative use as they are only sold to a single customer and whose underlying contract terms provide the company with an enforceable right to payment including a reasonable profit margin for performance completed to date in the event of customer termination for the contracts recognized over time we typically record revenue using the input method based on the materials and labor costs incurred to date relative to the contract’s total estimated costs this method reasonably depicts when and as control of the goods transfers to the customer since it measures our progress in producing the goods which is generally commensurate with this transfer of 

control since we typically invoice our customers at the same time that we satisfy our performance obligations contract assets and contract liabilities related to our contracts with customers recorded in the consolidated balance sheets were not material as of december 31 2019 and 2018 

​ 

preadoption of topic 606 

​ 

for the year ended december 31 2017 revenue from sales of the company’s products was recognized at the time the goods were delivered title passed and the risks and rewards of ownership passed to the customer provided the earnings process was complete and revenue was measurable such recognition generally occurred when the products reached the shipping point the sales price was fixed and determinable and collection was reasonably assured delivery was determined by the company’s shipping terms which was primarily freight on board shipping point revenue was recorded at the net amount to be received after deductions for estimated discounts allowances and returns these estimates and reserves were determined and adjusted as needed based upon historical experience contract terms and other related factors 

​ 

income taxes 

​ 

deferred income taxes are provided for revenue and expenses which are recognized in different periods for income tax and financial statement reporting purposes the company recognizes the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on deferred income taxes in the period in which legislation is enacted deferred income taxes are provided on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries in the period in which the company determines it no longer intends to permanently reinvest such earnings outside the united states as of december 31 2019 the company has not provided for deferred income taxes on undistributed foreign earnings related to certain geographies of approximately 900 as it is the company’s intention to permanently reinvest such earnings outside the united states it is impracticable to calculate the amount of taxes that would be payable if these undistributed foreign earnings were to be repatriated in addition the company remains indefinitely reinvested with respect to its financial statement basis in excess of tax basis of its investments in foreign subsidiaries it is not practicable to determine the deferred tax liability with respect to such basis differences deferred tax assets are regularly assessed for recoverability based on both historical and anticipated earnings levels and a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that these amounts will not be recovered the tax effects of an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns are recognized only if it is “more likely than not” to be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on its technical merits as of the reporting date the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement the company includes estimated interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes 

​ 

as a result of the tax act in 2017 the company recorded i a provisional income tax charge related to the deemed repatriation of the accumulated unremitted earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries ii a provisional income tax charge related to changes in the company’s permanent reinvestment assertion with regards to prior accumulated unremitted earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries partially offset by iii a provisional income tax benefit associated with the remeasurement of its net deferred tax liabilities due to the us federal corporate tax rate reduction and included these amounts in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2017 beginning in 2018 the global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” provision imposed a tax on certain earnings of foreign subsidiaries the company elected an accounting policy to account for gilti as a period cost the us treasury department has issued final interpretive guidance relating to certain provisions of the tax act and proposed additional guidance related to the same provisions the company will account for the impact of additional guidance in the period in which any new guidance is released if appropriate

​ 

in december 2017 the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 “sab 118” which was codified under asu 201805 to address the application of us gaap in situations where a registrant does not have the necessary information available prepared or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the tax act in 2017 the company recorded a provisional income tax charge as a result of the tax act consistent with asu 201805 t he company completed its accounting and recorded an income tax benefit in 2018

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

​ 

 amounts in millions  

​ 

the company in the normal course of doing business is exposed to a variety of risks including market risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates the company does not have any significant concentration with any one counterparty 

​ 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

​ 

the company conducts business in many foreign currencies through its worldwide operations and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the company’s sales operating margins and equity the company attempts to manage currency exposure risk in a number of ways including producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency cost reduction and pricing actions working capital management and hedging contracts however there can be no assurance that these actions will be fully effective in managing currency risk including in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the foreign currencies of the company’s worldwide operations 

​ 

in july 2018 the company and one of its wholly owned european subsidiaries collectively the “euro issuer” entered into a euro commercial paper program and then in october 2018 issued €5000 approximately 5746 of unsecured 2000 senior notes “2028 euro notes” due october 8 2028 while the 2028 euro notes are denominated in euros any borrowings under the company’s euro commercial paper program may be denominated in various foreign currencies including the euro when borrowing in foreign currencies there can be no assurance that the company can successfully manage these changes in exchange rates including in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the foreign currencies for which such borrowings are made refer to note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of debt 

​ 

the company utilizes foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies as of december 31 2019 the fair value of such contracts was not material a 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material effect on the value of the hedges as of december 31 2019 and 2018 the company does not engage in purchasing forward contracts for trading or speculative purposes refer to note 1 and note 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of derivative financial instruments 

​ 

interest rate risk 

​ 

the company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on the company’s financing activities the company manages its exposure to interest rate risk through a mix of fixed and variable rate debt the company currently has outstanding various fixed rate series of senior notes over various maturity dates two of which were issued in 2019 in january 2019 the company issued 5000 of unsecured 4350 senior notes due june 2029 the net proceeds of which along with borrowings under the us commercial paper program were used to repay 7500 of 255 senior notes due january 30 2019 in september 2019 the company issued 9000 of unsecured 280 senior notes due february 2030 the net proceeds of which were used to repay the cash consideration payable as a result of the tender offers associated with the 3125 senior notes and 400 senior notes with the remaining net proceeds being used for general corporate purposes including to partially reduce outstanding borrowings related to the us commercial paper program 

​ 

while there were no such borrowings as of december 31 2019 any borrowings under the revolving credit facility either bear interest at or trade at rates that fluctuate with a spread over libor any borrowings under the commercial paper programs are subject to floating interest rates therefore when the company borrows under these debt instruments the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates as of december 31 2019 approximately 400 or 11 of the company’s outstan ding borrowings which related primarily to the company’s commercial paper programs were subject to floating interest rates at december 31 2019 and 2018 the company’s average floating rate on borrowings under the us commercial paper program was 185 and 288 respectively at december 31 2019 and 2018 the company’s average floating rate on borrowings under the euro commercial paper program was 013 and 010 respectively a 10 change in the interest rate at december 31 2019 and 2018 for either or both commercial paper programs would not have a material effect on interest expense the company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2020 although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not change significantly

risks related to our global operations 

  

nonus markets form a substantial portion of the company’s business and as a result the company is more exposed to political economic military and other risks in countries outside the united states 

  

during 2018 nonus markets constituted approximately 73 of the company’s net sales with china constituting approximately 32 of the company’s net sales the company employs approximately 90 of its workforce outside the united states the company’s customers are located throughout the world and the company has many manufacturing administrative and sales facilities outside the united states as a result our financial results and our operations including our ability to manufacture assemble and test design develop or sell products and the demand for our products may be adversely affected by a number of global and regional factors outside of our control because the company has extensive nonus operations as well as significant cash and cash investments held at institutions located outside of the united states it is exposed to additional risks that could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition results of operations or cash flows including 

  







  

 

international trade disputes may result in increased tariffs trade barriers and other protectionist measures that could increase our manufacturing costs make our products less competitive reduce consumer demand or impede or slow the movement of our goods across borders increasing protectionism and economic nationalism may lead to further changes in trade policy domestic sourcing initiatives or other formal and informal measures that could make it more difficult to sell our products in some markets 

  

changes in general economic conditions geopolitical conditions us trade policies and other factors beyond the company’s control may adversely impact our business and operating results 

  

the company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global regional and us economic and geopolitical conditions in recent years there has been discussion and dialogue regarding potential significant changes to us trade policies legislation treaties and tariffs as well as trade policies and tariffs affecting china in the case of the north american free trade agreement “nafta” on december 1 2018 the united states mexico and canada signed a new trade agreement called the united statesmexicocanada agreement “usmca” which would replace nafta but which as of the date of this filing must still be ratified by each countrys legislature if the legislature in any one or more of the signatory countries fails to ratify the usmca then the future status of nafta is uncertain changes to current policies by the us government could affect our business including potentially through increased import tariffs and other influences on us trade relations with china and other countries the imposition of tariffs or other trade barriers could increase our costs in certain markets and may cause our customers to find alternative sourcing in addition other countries may change their own policies on business and foreign investment in companies in their respective countries additionally it is possible that us policy changes and uncertainty about such changes could increase market volatility and currency exchange rate fluctuations market volatility and currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

in addition to changes in us trade policy a number of other economic and geopolitical factors both in the united states and abroad could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition results of operations or cash flows such as 

  



























  

our international operations require us to comply with anticorruption laws and regulations of the us government and various foreign jurisdictions and our business reputation and financial results may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees customers suppliers distributors or any other business partners 

  

doing business on a worldwide basis requires us and our subsidiaries to comply with the laws and regulations of the us government and various foreign jurisdictions and our failure to comply with these rules and regulations may expose us to significant liabilities these laws and regulations may apply to companies individual directors officers employees subcontractors and agents and may restrict our operations trade practices investment decisions and partnering activities in particular our international operations are subject to us and foreign anticorruption laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 as amended “fcpa” the fcpa prohibits us 

 

companies and their officers directors employees and agents acting on their behalf from corruptly offering promising authorizing or providing anything of value to foreign officials for the purposes of influencing official decisions or obtaining or retaining business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment the fcpa also requires companies to make and keep books records and accounts that accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets and to maintain a system of adequate internal accounting controls as part of our business we deal with stateowned business enterprises the employees and representatives of which may be considered foreign officials for purposes of the fcpa in addition some of the foreign locations in which we operate lack a developed legal system and have elevated levels of corruption as a result of the above activities we are exposed to the risk of violating anticorruption laws 

  

we have established policies and procedures designed to assist us and our personnel in complying with applicable us and international laws and regulations however there can be no assurance that these policies will be effective in preventing our directors officers employees subcontractors and agents from taking actions that violate these legal requirements violations of these legal requirements could subject us to criminal fines and imprisonment civil penalties disgorgement of profits injunctions debarment from government contracts as well as other remedial measures in addition any actual or alleged violations could disrupt our operations cause reputational harm involve significant management distraction and result in a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

  

the company’s results may be negatively affected by foreign currency exchange rates 

  

the company conducts business in many foreign currencies through its worldwide operations and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies including possible currency devaluations changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the company’s sales operating margins and equity the company manages currency exposure risk in a number of ways including producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency cost reduction and pricing actions and working capital management however there can be no assurance that these actions will be fully effective in managing currency risk including in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the foreign currencies of the company’s worldwide operations which could have an adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

  

the company may experience difficulties in obtaining a consistent supply of materials at stable pricing levels 

  

the company uses basic materials like aluminum steel copper titanium metal alloys gold silver certain rare earth metals and plastic resins in its manufacturing processes as well as a variety of components and relies on third party suppliers to secure these materials volatility in the prices of such materials and availability of supply may have a substantial impact on the price the company pays for such materials in addition the company may not be able to pass along increased raw material or component prices to its customers consequently our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

  

in limited instances we depend on a single source of supply or participate in commodity markets that may be served by a limited number of suppliers delays in obtaining supplies may result from a number of factors affecting our suppliers and any delay could impair our ability to deliver products to our customers and accordingly could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial position 

  

risks related to our end markets 

  

the company is dependent on the communications industry including information technology and data communications wireless communications and broadband communications 

  

approximately 49 of the company’s 2018 net sales came from sales to the communications industry including information technology and data communication wireless communications and broadband communications with 17 of the company’s 2018 net sales coming from sales to the mobile devices market demand for these products is subject to rapid technological change see below—“the company is dependent on the acceptance of new product introductions for continued revenue growth” these markets are dominated by several large manufacturers and operators who regularly exert significant pressure on their suppliers including the company furthermore there has been a trend on the part of customers to consolidate their lists of qualified suppliers to companies that have the ability to meet certain technical quality delivery and other standards while maintaining competitive prices there can be no assurance that the company will be able to meet these standards or maintain competitive pricing and therefore continue to compete 

 

successfully in the communications industry the company’s failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

  

approximately 5 and 8 of the company’s 2018 net sales came from sales to the broadband communications and mobile networks markets respectively demand for the company’s products in these markets depends primarily on capital spending by operators for constructing rebuilding or upgrading their systems the amount of this capital spending and therefore the company’s sales and profitability will be affected by a variety of factors including general economic conditions consolidation within the communications industry the financial condition of operators and their access to financing competition technological developments new legislation and regulation of operators there can be no assurance that existing levels of capital spending will continue or that spending will not decrease 

  

changes in defense expenditures may reduce the company’s sales 

  

approximately 10 of the company’s 2018 net sales came from sales to the military market the company participates in a broad spectrum of defense programs the company’s military sales are generally to contractors and subcontractors of the us or foreign governments or to distributors that in turn sell to the contractors and subcontractors accordingly the company’s sales are affected by changes in the defense budgets of the us and foreign governments a significant decline in us or foreign government defense expenditures could have an adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations us government expenditures are also subject to political and budgetary fluctuations and constraints which may result in significant unexpected changes in levels of demand for our products 

  

the company is dependent on the acceptance of new product introductions for continued revenue growth 

  

the company estimates that products introduced in the last two years accounted for approximately 25 of 2018 net sales the company’s longterm results of operations depend substantially upon its ability to continue to conceive design source and market new products and upon continuing market acceptance of its existing and future product lines in the ordinary course of business the company continually develops or creates new product line concepts if the company fails or is significantly delayed in introducing new product line concepts or if the company’s new products are not met with market acceptance its business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

  

the company encounters competition in substantially all areas of its business 

  

the company competes primarily on the basis of technology innovation product quality and performance price customer service and delivery time competitors include large diversified companies some of which have greater assets and financial resources than the company as well as medium to small companies in addition rapid technological changes occurring in the communications industry could also lead to the entry of new competitors of all sizes against whom we may not be able to successfully compete there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against existing or new competition and the inability to do so may result in price reductions reduced margins or loss of market share any of which could have an adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

  

risks related to acquisitions 

  

the company may experience difficulties and unanticipated expenses in connection with purchasing and integrating newly acquired businesses 

  

the company has completed a number of acquisitions in recent years including the recent acquisition of ssi controls technologies “ssi” the sensor manufacturing division of ssi technologies inc in january 2019 the company anticipates that it will continue to pursue acquisition opportunities as part of its growth strategy the company may experience difficulty and unanticipated expenses associated with purchasing and integrating such acquisitions and the acquisitions may not perform as expected the company may also experience challenges following the acquisition of a new company or business including but not limited to managing the operations manufacturing facilities and technology maintaining and increasing the customer base or retaining key employees suppliers and distributors although we expect to realize strategic operational and financial benefits as a result of past or future acquisitions and investments we cannot predict or guarantee whether and to what extent anticipated cost savings benefits and growth prospects will be achieved 

  

 

the company may in the future incur goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges 

  

at december 31 2018 the total assets of the company were 100449 million which included 41032 million of goodwill the excess of fair value of consideration paid over the fair value of net identifiable assets of businesses acquired the company performs annual evaluations or more frequently if necessary for the potential impairment of the carrying value of goodwill such evaluations to date have not resulted in the need to recognize an impairment however if the financial performance of the company’s businesses were to decline significantly the company could incur a material noncash charge to its income statement for the impairment of goodwill furthermore we cannot provide assurance that impairment charges in the future will not be required if the expected cash flow estimates as projected by management do not occur especially if an economic recession occurs and continues for a lengthy period or becomes severe or if acquisitions and investments made by the company fail to achieve expected returns 

  

risks related to our liquidity and capital resources 

  

the company’s credit agreements contain certain covenants which if breached could have a material adverse effect on the company 

  

the credit agreement dated as of march 1 2016 and as amended effective january 15 2019 among the company certain subsidiaries of the company and a syndicate of financial institutions the “revolving credit facility” which also backstops the company’s us commercial paper program and euro commercial paper program contains financial and other covenants such as a limit on the ratio of debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization a limit on priority indebtedness and limits on incurrence of liens although the company believes none of these covenants is presently restrictive to the company’s operations the ability to meet the financial covenants can be affected by events beyond the company’s control and the company cannot provide assurance that it will meet those tests a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the revolving credit facility upon the occurrence of an event of default under any of the company’s credit facilities the lenders could terminate all commitments to extend further credit and elect to declare amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable which could result in the company not having sufficient assets to repay the revolving credit facility and other indebtedness as of december 31 2018 the company had outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility as well as its us commercial paper program and euro commercial paper program of nil 5545 million and 688 million respectively 

  

the company relies on the capital markets and its inability to access those markets on favorable terms could adversely affect the company’s results 

  

the company has used the capital markets to invest in its business and make strategic acquisitions if general economic and capital market conditions deteriorate significantly it could impact the company’s ability to access the capital markets while the company has not recently encountered any financing difficulties the capital and credit markets have experienced significant volatility in the past market conditions could make it more difficult to access capital to finance capital investments acquisitions and other initiatives including dividends and share repurchases as such this could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition results of operations or cash flows in addition while the company has not encountered any such issues to date if the credit rating agencies that rate the company’s debt were to downgrade the company’s credit rating in conjunction with a deterioration of the company’s performance it would likely increase the company’s cost of capital and make it more difficult for the company to obtain new financing and access capital markets which could also have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

the company’s results may be negatively affected by changing interest rates  

  

the company is subject to interest rate volatility with regard to existing and future issuances of debt the company monitors its mix of fixedrate and variablerate debt as well as its mix of shortterm and longterm debt as of december 31 2018 approximately 6399 million or 18 of the company’s outstanding borrowings were subject to floating interest rates and were primarily comprised of commercial paper borrowings a 10 change in libor or floating interest rates at december 31 2018 would not have a material effect on the company’s interest expense the company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2019 although there can be no assurance that interest rates will not change significantly 

  

 

as of december 31 2018 approximately 82 of the company’s outstanding borrowings were based on fixed rates and primarily related to the following unsecured senior notes 

  



  

in january 2019 the company issued 5000 million principal amount of 4350 senior notes due june 1 2029 the net proceeds of which were used along with borrowings under the us commercial paper program to repay the 7500 million of 255 senior notes due in january 2019

revenue recognition   

  

adoption of topic 606 

  

the company adopted accounting standards update “asu” no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 collectively with its related subsequent amendments “topic 606” as of january 1 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method applied to those contracts which were not completed as of january 1 2018 under this transition method the company’s results in the consolidated statements of income for the year ended december 31 2018 are presented under topic 606 while the comparative results for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 were not retrospectively adjusted results for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 were recognized in accordance with the company’s revenue recognition policy then in effect under asc topic 605 revenue recognition “topic 605” discussed below the adoption of topic 606 resulted in accounting policy changes surrounding revenue recognition which replaced previous revenue guidance under topic 605 

  

the company’s primary source of revenues consist of product sales to either end customers and their appointed contract manufacturers including original equipment manufacturers or oem or to distributors our revenues are derived from contracts with customers which in most cases are customer purchase orders that may be governed by master sales agreements for each contract the promise to transfer the control of the products each of which is individually distinct is considered to be the identified performance obligation as part of the consideration promised in each contract the company evaluates the customer’s credit risk our contracts do not have any significant financing components as payment terms are generally due net 30 to 120 days after delivery although products are almost always sold at fixed prices in determining the transaction price we evaluate whether the price is subject to refund due to returns or adjustment due to volume discounts rebates or price concessions to determine the net consideration we expect to be entitled to we allocate the transaction price to each distinct product based on its relative standalone selling price taxes assessed by governmental authorities and collected from the customer including but not limited to sales and use taxes and valueadded taxes are not included in the transaction price 

  

the vast majority of our sales are recognized at a pointintime under the core principle of recognizing revenue when control transfers to the customer which generally occurs when we ship or deliver the product from our 

 

manufacturing facility to our customers when our customer accepts and has legal title of the goods and the company has a present right to payment for such goods based on the respective contract terms most of our contracts’ revenues are recognized either i upon shipment based on free on board “fob” shipping point ii when the product arrives at its destination or iii when the products are pulled from consignment inventory for the year ended december 31 2018 less than 5 of our net sales are recognized over time as the associated contracts relate to the sale of goods with no alternative use as they are only sold to a single customer and whose underlying contract terms provide the company with an enforceable right to payment including a reasonable profit margin for performance completed to date in the event of customer termination for the contracts recognized over time we typically record revenue using the input method based on the materials and labor costs incurred to date relative to the contract’s total estimated costs this method reasonably depicts when and as control of the goods transfers to the customer since it measures our progress in producing the goods which is generally commensurate with this transfer of control since we typically invoice our customers at the same time that we satisfy our performance obligations we do not have significant contract assets or contract liabilities related to our contracts with customers recorded in the consolidated balance sheets 

  

preadoption of topic 606 

  

for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 revenue from sales of the company’s products was recognized at the time the goods were delivered title passed and the risks and rewards of ownership passed to the customer provided the earnings process was complete and revenue was measurable such recognition generally occurred when the products reached the shipping point the sales price was fixed and determinable and collection was reasonably assured delivery was determined by the company’s shipping terms which was primarily freight on board shipping point revenue was recorded at the net amount to be received after deductions for estimated discounts allowances and returns these estimates and reserves were determined and adjusted as needed based upon historical experience contract terms and other related factors

 item 1a risk factors 

  

investors should carefully consider the risks described below and all other information in this annual report on form 10k the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the company additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the company or that it currently deems immaterial may also impair the company’s business operations liquidity and financial condition 

  

if actions taken by management to limit monitor or control financial enterprise risk exposures are not successful the company’s business and consolidated financial statements could be materially adversely affected in such case the trading price of the company’s common stock could decline and investors may lose all or part of their investment 

  

the company is dependent on the communications industry including information technology and data communications wireless communications and broadband communications 

  

approximately 48 of the company’s 2017 net sales came from sales to the communications industry including information technology and data communication wireless communications and broadband communications with 14 of the company’s 2017 net sales coming from sales to the mobile device market demand for these products is subject to rapid technological change see below—“the company is dependent on the acceptance of new product introductions for continued revenue growth” these markets are dominated by several large manufacturers and operators who regularly exert significant pressure on their suppliers including the company furthermore there has been a trend on the part of customers to consolidate their lists of qualified suppliers to companies that have the ability to meet certain technical 

 

quality delivery and other standards while maintaining competitive prices there can be no assurance that the company will be able to meet these standards or maintain competitive pricing and therefore continue to compete successfully in the communications industry the company’s failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

  

approximately 6 and 8 of the company’s 2017 net sales came from sales to the broadband communications and mobile networks markets respectively demand for the company’s products in these markets depends primarily on capital spending by operators for constructing rebuilding or upgrading their systems the amount of this capital spending and therefore the company’s sales and profitability will be affected by a variety of factors including general economic conditions consolidation within the communications industry the financial condition of operators and their access to financing competition technological developments new legislation and regulation of operators there can be no assurance that existing levels of capital spending will continue or that spending will not decrease 

  

changes in defense expenditures may reduce the company’s sales 

  

approximately 10 of the company’s 2017 net sales came from sales to the military market the company participates in a broad spectrum of defense programs the company’s military sales are generally to contractors and subcontractors of the us or foreign governments or to distributors that in turn sell to the contractors and subcontractors accordingly the company’s sales are affected by changes in the defense budgets of the us and foreign governments a significant decline in us or foreign government defense expenditures could have an adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

  

the company encounters competition in substantially all areas of its business 

  

the company competes primarily on the basis of technology innovation product quality price customer service and delivery time competitors include large diversified companies some of which have greater assets and financial resources than the company as well as medium to small companies there can be no assurance that additional competitors will not enter the company’s existing markets nor can there be any assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against existing or new competition and the inability to do so could have an adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

  

the company is dependent on the acceptance of new product introductions for continued revenue growth 

  

the company estimates that products introduced in the last two years accounted for approximately 25 of 2017 net sales the company’s longterm results of operations depend substantially upon its ability to continue to conceive design source and market new products and upon continuing market acceptance of its existing and future product lines in the ordinary course of business the company continually develops or creates new product line concepts if the company fails or is significantly delayed in introducing new product line concepts or if the company’s new products are not met with market acceptance its business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

  

the company’s credit agreements contain certain covenants which if breached could have a material adverse effect on the company 

  

the credit agreement dated as of march 1 2016 among the company certain subsidiaries of the company and a syndicate of financial institutions the “revolving credit facility” which also backstops the company’s commercial paper program contains financial and other covenants such as a limit on the ratio of debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization a limit on priority indebtedness and limits on incurrence of liens although the company believes none of these covenants is presently restrictive to the company’s operations the ability to meet the financial covenants can be affected by events beyond the company’s control and the company cannot provide assurance that it will meet those tests a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the revolving credit facility upon the occurrence of an event of default under any of the company’s credit facilities the lenders could terminate all commitments to extend further credit and elect to declare amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable which could result in the company not having sufficient assets to repay the revolving credit facility and other indebtedness as of december 31 2017 the company had outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and the commercial paper program of nil and 11754 million respectively 

  

 

the company relies on the capital markets and its inability to access those markets on favorable terms could adversely affect the company’s results 

  

the company has used the capital markets to invest in its business and make strategic acquisitions if general economic and capital market conditions deteriorate significantly it could impact the company’s ability to access the capital markets while the company has not recently encountered any financing difficulties the capital and credit markets have experienced significant volatility in the past market conditions could make it more difficult to access capital to finance capital investments acquisitions and other initiatives including dividends and share repurchases as such this could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition results of operations or cash flows in addition while the company has not encountered any such issues to date if the credit rating agencies that rate the company’s debt were to downgrade the company’s credit rating in conjunction with a deterioration of the company’s performance it would likely increase the company’s cost of capital and make it more difficult for the company to obtain new financing and access capital markets which could also have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

the company’s results may be negatively affected by changing interest rates  

  

the company is subject to interest rate volatility with regard to existing and future issuances of debt the company monitors the mix of fixedrate and variablerate debt as well as the mix of shortterm and longterm debt as of december 31 2017 approximately 11820 million or 33 of the company’s outstanding borrowings were subject to floating interest rates and were primarily comprised of commercial paper borrowings a 10 change in libor or floating interest rates at december 31 2017 would not have a material effect on the company’s interest expense the company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2018 although there can be no assurance that interest rates will not change significantly 

  

as of december 31 2017 approximately 67 of the company’s outstanding borrowings were based on fixed rates and primarily related to the following unsecured senior notes 

  



  

the company’s results may be negatively affected by foreign currency exchange rates 

  

the company conducts business in many international currencies through its worldwide operations and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies including possible currency devaluations changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the company’s sales operating margins and equity the company manages currency exposure risk in a number of ways including producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency cost reduction and pricing actions and working capital management however there can be no assurance that these actions will be fully effective in managing currency risk including in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the company’s worldwide operations which could have an adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

  

changes in fiscal and tax policies audits and examinations by taxing authorities could impact the company’s results 

  

the company is subject to taxes in the us and numerous international jurisdictions changes in tax laws regulations and other tax guidance including related interpretations could materially impact the company’s current noncurrent and deferred tax assets and liabilities the company is subject to tax examinations by various tax authorities and in addition new examinations could be initiated by tax authorities as the company has operations in jurisdictions throughout the world the risk of tax examinations will continue to occur the company’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows may be materially impacted by the results of these tax examinations 

 

  

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act “tax act” the changes included in the tax act are broad and complex the final transition impacts of the tax act may differ from the estimates provided elsewhere in this report possibly materially due to among other things changes in interpretations of the tax act any legislative action to address questions that arise because of the tax act any changes in accounting standards for income taxes or related interpretations in response to the tax act or any updates or changes to estimates the company has utilized to calculate the transition impacts 

  

nonus markets form a substantial portion of the company’s business and as a result the company is more exposed to political economic military and other risks in countries outside the united states 

  

during 2017 nonus markets constituted approximately 72 of the company’s net sales with china constituting approximately 30 of the company’s net sales the company employs approximately 90 of its workforce outside the united states the company’s customers are located throughout the world and the company has many manufacturing administrative and sales facilities outside the united states because the company has extensive nonus operations as well as significant cash and cash investments held at institutions located outside of the us it is exposed to additional risks that could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition results of operations or cash flows including 

  







  

changes in general economic conditions geopolitical conditions us trade policies and other factors beyond the company’s control may adversely impact our business and operating results 

  

the company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global regional and us economic and geopolitical conditions during and following the us presidential election in 2016 there has been discussion and dialogue regarding potential significant changes to us trade policies legislation treaties and tariffs including the north american free trade agreement “nafta” as well as trade policies and tariffs affecting china at this time it is unknown whether and to what extent new legislation will be passed into law pending or new regulatory proposals will be adopted international trade agreements will be negotiated or the effect that any such action would have either positively or negatively on our industry or our company if any new legislation andor regulations are implemented or if existing trade agreements are renegotiated it may be inefficient and expensive for us to alter our business operations in order to adapt to or comply with such changes such operational changes could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

 

in addition to changes in us trade policy a number of other economic and geopolitical factors both in the us and abroad could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition results of operations or cash flows which could ultimately result in

the company may experience difficulties in obtaining a consistent supply of materials at stable pricing levels 

  

the company uses basic materials like aluminum steel copper titanium metal alloys gold silver certain rare earth metals and plastic resins in its manufacturing processes volatility in the prices of such materials and availability of supply may have a substantial impact on the price the company pays for such materials in addition to the extent such cost increases cannot be recovered through sales price increases or productivity improvements the company’s margins may decline 

  

our business reputation and financial results may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees customers suppliers distributors or any other business partners

revenue recognition  the company’s primary source of revenues is from product sales to its customers revenue from sales of the company’s products is recognized at the time the goods are delivered title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership pass to the customer provided the earnings process is complete and revenue is measurable such recognition generally occurs when the products reach the shipping point the sales price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured delivery is determined by the company’s shipping terms which are primarily freight on board shipping point revenue is recorded at the net amount to be received after deductions for estimated discounts allowances and returns these estimates and reserves are determined and adjusted as needed based upon historical experience contract terms and other related factors the shipping costs for the majority of the company’s sales are paid directly by the company’s customers in the broadband communications market approximately 6 of net sales in 2017 the company pays for shipping costs to the majority of its customers shipping costs are also paid by the company for certain customers in the interconnect products and assemblies segment amounts billed to customers related to shipping costs are immaterial and are included in net sales shipping costs incurred to transport products to the customer which are not reimbursed are included in selling general and administrative expenses 

  

 

inventories  inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost which approximates average cost or net realizable value the principal components of cost included in inventories are materials direct labor and manufacturing overhead the company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand evaluates the realizability of inventories and adjusts the carrying value as necessary based on forecasted product demand provisions for slowmoving and obsolete inventory are made based on historical experience and product demand should future product demand change existing inventory could become slowmoving or obsolete and provisions would be increased accordingly 

  

goodwill  the company performs its evaluation for the impairment of goodwill for the company’s two reporting units on an annual basis or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that a reporting unit’s carrying amount may be impaired the company has defined its reporting units as the two reportable business segments “interconnect products and assemblies” and “cable products and solutions” as the components of these reportable business segments have similar economic characteristics 

  

in 2017 and 2016 the company utilized the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it was necessary to perform the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment assessment as part of this assessment the company reviews qualitative factors which include but are not limited to economic market and industry conditions as well as the financial performance of each reporting unit in accordance with applicable guidance an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit if after assessing these qualitative factors the company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting units is greater than its respective carrying amount as of july 1 2017 and 2016 the company determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting units exceeded their respective carrying amounts 

  

the company has not recognized any goodwill impairment in 2017 2016 or 2015 in connection with its annual impairment assessment 

  

acquisitions  the company accounts for acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting which requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date the purchase price of acquisitions is allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values and any excess purchase price over the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill any subsequent adjustments to the purchase price allocation prior to the completion of the measurement period will be reflected as an adjustment to goodwill in the period in which the adjustments are identified the company may use independent valuation specialists to assist in determining the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed which could require certain significant management assumptions and estimates 

  

defined benefit plan obligation  the defined benefit plan obligation is based on significant assumptions such as mortality rates discount rates and plan asset rates of return as determined by the company in consultation with the respective benefit plan actuaries and investment advisors refer to note 7 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements

as a result of the tax act the company has recorded i a provisional income tax charge related to the deemed repatriation of the accumulated unremitted earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries ii a provisional income tax 

 

charge related to changes in the company’s permanent reinvestment assertion with regards to prior accumulated unremitted earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries partially offset by iii a provisional income tax benefit associated with the remeasurement of its net deferred tax liabilities due to the us federal corporate tax rate reduction and included these amounts in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2017 beginning in 2018 the tax act also includes a global intangible lowtaxed income gilti provision which as currently interpreted by the company requires a tax on foreign earnings in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign subsidiaries the company has elected an accounting policy to account for gilti as a period cost if incurred rather than recognizing deferred taxes for temporary basis differences expected to reverse as gilti other provisions of the tax act that impact future tax years continue to be assessed 

  

in december 2017 the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 “sab 118” to address the application of us gaap in situations where a registrant does not have the necessary information available prepared or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the tax act in 2017 the company recorded provisional income tax charges as a result of the tax act due to the timing of the tax act’s enactment and the complexity of its provisions the company has not completed its accounting for the impact of the tax act the company will analyze guidance and technical interpretations of the provisions of the tax act as well as refine analyze and update the underlying data computations and assumptions used to prepare these provisional amounts the company will complete its accounting in 2018 once the company has obtained prepared and fully analyzed all the necessary information we will record any necessary adjustments in the period in which such adjustments are identified

any borrowings under the revolving credit facility either bear interest at or trade at rates that fluctuate with a spread over libor while any borrowings under the commercial paper program are subject to floating interest rates therefore when the company borrows under these debt instruments the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates as of december 31 2017 11820 or 33 of the company’s outstanding borrowings which related mainly to its commercial paper program were subject to floating interest rates at december 31 2017 and 2016 the company’s average floating rate on such borrowings was 171 and 106 respectively a 10 change in this interest rate at december 31 2017 and 2016 would not have a material effect on interest expense the company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2018 although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not change significantly

the company is dependent on the communications industry including information technology and data communications wireless communications and broadband communications 

  

approximately 50 of the company’s 2016 net sales came from sales to the communications industry including information technology and data communication wireless communications and broadband communications with 14 of the company’s 2016 net sales coming from sales to the mobile device market demand for these products is subject to rapid technological change see below—“the company is dependent on the acceptance of new product introductions for continued revenue growth” these markets are dominated by several large manufacturers and operators who regularly exert significant pressure on their suppliers including the company furthermore there has been a trend on the part of oem customers to consolidate their lists of qualified suppliers to companies that have the ability to meet certain quality delivery and other standards while maintaining competitive prices there can be no assurance that the company will be able to meet these standards or maintain competitive pricing and therefore continue to compete successfully in the communications industry the company’s failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

  

approximately 6 and 9 of the company’s 2016 net sales came from sales to the broadband communications and mobile networks markets respectively demand for the company’s products in these markets depends primarily on capital spending by operators for constructing rebuilding or upgrading their systems the amount of this capital spending and therefore the company’s sales and profitability will be affected by a variety of factors including general economic conditions consolidation within the communications industry the financial condition of operators and their 

 

access to financing competition technological developments new legislation and regulation of operators there can be no assurance that existing levels of capital spending will continue or that spending will not decrease 

  

changes in defense expenditures may reduce the company’s sales 

  

approximately 9 of the company’s 2016 net sales came from sales to the military market the company participates in a broad spectrum of defense programs the substantial majority of these sales are related to both us and foreign military and defense programs the company’s military sales are generally to contractors and subcontractors of the us or foreign governments or to distributors that in turn sell to the contractors and subcontractors accordingly the company’s sales are affected by changes in the defense budgets of the us and foreign governments a significant decline in us or foreign government defense expenditures could have an adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

  

the company encounters competition in substantially all areas of its business 

  

the company competes primarily on the basis of technology innovation product quality price customer service and delivery time competitors include large diversified companies some of which have greater assets and financial resources than the company as well as medium to small companies there can be no assurance that additional competitors will not enter the company’s existing markets nor can there be any assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against existing or new competition and the inability to do so could have an adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

  

the company is dependent on the acceptance of new product introductions for continued revenue growth 

  

the company estimates that products introduced in the last two years accounted for approximately 20 of 2016 net sales the company’s longterm results of operations depend substantially upon its ability to continue to conceive design source and market new products and upon continuing market acceptance of its existing and future product lines in the ordinary course of business the company continually develops or creates new product line concepts if the company fails to or is significantly delayed in introducing new product line concepts or if the company’s new products are not met with market acceptance its business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

  

the company’s credit agreements contain certain covenants which if breached could have a material adverse effect on the company 

  

the credit agreement dated as of march 1 2016 among the company certain subsidiaries of the company and a syndicate of financial institutions the “revolving credit facility” which also backstops the company’s commercial paper program contains financial and other covenants such as a limit on the ratio of debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization a limit on priority indebtedness and limits on incurrence of liens although the company believes none of these covenants is presently restrictive to the company’s operations the ability to meet the financial covenants can be affected by events beyond the company’s control and the company cannot provide assurance that it will meet those tests a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the revolving credit facility upon the occurrence of an event of default under any of the company’s credit facilities the lenders could elect to declare amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit if the lenders accelerate the repayment of borrowings the company may not have sufficient assets to repay the revolving credit facility and other indebtedness as of december 31 2016 the company had outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and the commercial paper program of nil and 10189 million respectively 

  

the company relies on the capital markets and its inability to access those markets on favorable terms could adversely affect the company’s results 

  

the company has used the capital markets to invest in its business and make strategic acquisitions if general economic and capital market conditions deteriorate significantly it could impact the company’s ability to access the capital markets while the company has not recently encountered any financing difficulties the capital and credit markets have experienced significant volatility in the past market conditions could make it more difficult to access capital to finance capital investments acquisitions and other initiatives including dividends and share repurchases as such this could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition results of operations or 

 

cash flows in addition while the company has not encountered any such issues to date if the credit rating agencies that rate the company’s debt were to downgrade the company’s credit rating in conjunction with a deterioration of the company’s performance it would likely increase the company’s cost of capital and make it more difficult for the company to obtain new financing and access capital markets which could also have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

the company’s results may be negatively affected by changing interest rates  

  

the company is subject to interest rate volatility with regard to existing and future issuances of debt the company monitors the mix of fixedrate and variablerate debt as well as the mix of shortterm and longterm debt as of december 31 2016 10244 million or 34 of the company’s outstanding borrowings were subject to floating interest rates 

  

as of december 31 2016 the company had the following unsecured senior notes outstanding 

  



  

a 10 change in libor or floating interest rates at december 31 2016 would not have a material effect on the company’s interest expense the company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2017 although there can be no assurance that interest rates will not change significantly 

  

the company’s results may be negatively affected by foreign currency exchange rates 

  

the company conducts business in many international currencies through its worldwide operations and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies including possible currency devaluations changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the company’s sales gross margins and equity the company manages currency exposure risk in a number of ways including producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency cost reduction and pricing actions and working capital management however there can be no assurance that these actions will be fully effective in managing currency risk especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the company’s worldwide operations which could have an adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

  

 

the company is subject to the risks of political economic and military instability in countries outside the united states 

  

nonus markets account for a substantial portion of the company’s business during 2016 nonus markets constituted approximately 72 of the company’s net sales with china constituting approximately 30 of the company’s net sales the company employs approximately 90 of its workforce outside the united states the company’s customers are located throughout the world and the company has many manufacturing administrative and sales facilities outside the united states because the company has extensive nonus operations as well as significant cash and cash investments held at institutions located outside of the us it is exposed to risks that could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition results of operations or cash flows including 

  



















  

the company may experience difficulties and unanticipated expense of assimilating newly acquired businesses including the potential for the impairment of goodwill 

  

the company has completed a number of acquisitions in recent years including the acquisition of fci on january 8 2016 the company anticipates that it will continue to pursue acquisition opportunities as part of its growth strategy the company may experience difficulty and unanticipated expenses associated with integrating such acquisitions and the acquisitions may not perform as expected at december 31 2016 the total assets of the company were 84987 million which included 36788 million of goodwill the excess of fair value of consideration paid over the fair value of net identifiable assets of businesses acquired the company performs annual evaluations for the potential impairment of the carrying value of goodwill such evaluations have not resulted in the need to recognize an impairment however if the financial performance of the company’s businesses were to decline significantly the company could incur a material noncash charge to its income statement for the impairment of goodwill 

  

the company may experience difficulties in obtaining a consistent supply of materials at stable pricing levels 

  

the company uses basic materials like aluminum steel copper titanium metal alloys gold silver certain rare earth metals and plastic resins in its manufacturing processes volatility in the prices of such materials and availability of supply may have a substantial impact on the price the company pays for such materials in addition to the extent such cost increases cannot be recovered through sales price increases or productivity improvements the company’s margins may decline 

  

our business reputation and financial results may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees customers suppliers distributors or any other business partners 

  

several antibribery laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act generally prohibit companies from engaging in improper conduct for the purpose of obtaining retaining or improving business such acts may include but are not limited to bribery conflicts of interest fraud kickbacks and money laundering while the company’s internal controls and systems are designed to protect it from illegal acts committed by employees customers suppliers distributors and other business partners that may violate us or local jurisdictional laws there are no guarantees that such internal controls and systems will always protect the company from such acts such violations or allegations could damage the company’s reputation lead to criminal or civil investigations in the us or foreign

recent accounting pronouncements 

  

refer to note 1 of the notes to the company’s consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements 

  

pensions 

  

the company and certain of its subsidiaries in the united states have defined benefit pension plans “us plans” which cover certain us employees and which represent the majority of the plan assets and benefit obligations of the aggregate defined benefit plans of the company the us plans’ benefits are generally based on years of service and 

 

compensation and are generally noncontributory certain us employees not covered by the us plans are covered by defined contribution plans certain foreign subsidiaries also have defined benefit plans covering their employees the “international plans” the pension expense for the us plans and the international plans together the “plans” approximated 242 310 and 224 in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively and is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions established on january 1 of the applicable year including a weighted average discount rate mortality projections rate of increase of future compensation levels and an expected longterm rate of return on the respective plans’ assets 

  

the discount rate used by the company for valuing pension liabilities is based on a review of high quality corporate bond yields with maturities approximating the remaining life of the projected benefit obligations the weighted average discount rate for the us plans on this basis was 393 and 411 at december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively the decrease in the discount rate for the us plans resulted in an increase in the benefit obligation of approximately 107 at december 31 2016 the weighted average discount rate for the international plans was 228 and 314 at december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively the decrease in the discount rate for the international plans did not have a material impact on the benefit obligation at december 31 2016 at december 31 2015 the company elected to further refine its approach for calculating its service and interest costs beginning in 2016 by applying a split discount rate approach under which specific spot rates along the selected yield curve are applied to the relevant projected cash flows as the company believes this method more precisely measures its obligations the mortality assumptions used by the company reflect commonly used mortality tables and improvement scales for each plan and increased life expectancies for plan participants 

  

in developing the expected longterm rate of return assumption for the us plans the company evaluated input from its external actuaries and investment consultants as well as consideration of longterm inflation assumptions projected returns by such consultants are based on broad equity and bond indices the company also considered its historical twentyyear compounded return of approximately 85 which has been in excess of these broad equity and bond benchmark indices the expected longterm rate of return on the us plans’ assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of approximately 60 with equity managers with an expected longterm rate of return of approximately 85 and 40 with fixed income managers with an expected longterm rate of return of approximately 60 the company believes that the longterm asset allocation on average will approximate 60 with equity managers and 40 with fixed income managers the company regularly reviews the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances investments to its targeted allocation when considered appropriate based on this methodology the company’s expected longterm rate of return assumption to determine the net periodic benefit cost of the us plans for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 was 775 and 800 respectively the companys expected weighted average longterm rate of return assumption to determine the net periodic benefit cost of the international plans for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 was 429 and 547 respectively 

  

the company made cash contributions to the plans of 262 241 and 238 in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively the total liability for accrued pension and postretirement benefit obligations under the company’s pension and postretirement benefit plans increased in 2016 to 2909 40 of which is included in other accrued expenses primarily representing required contributions to be made during 2017 for unfunded foreign plans from 2660 in 2015 primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate the company estimates that based on current actuarial calculations it will make aggregate cash contributions to the plans in 2017 of approximately 250 the majority of which will be to the us plans the timing and amount of cash contributions in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors including the investment performance of the plans’ assets 

  

the company offers various defined contribution plans for certain us and foreign employees participation in these plans is based on certain eligibility requirements the company matches the majority of employee contributions to the us defined contribution plans with cash contributions up to a maximum of 5 of eligible compensation the company provided matching contributions to its us defined contribution plans of approximately 50 42 and 38 in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively 

  

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates estimates are adjusted as new information becomes available the company’s critical accounting policies and estimates are set forth below the significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 of the notes to the company’s consolidated financial statements 

  

revenue recognition  the company’s primary source of revenues is from product sales to its customers revenue from sales of the company’s products is recognized at the time the goods are delivered title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership pass to the customer provided the earning process is complete and revenue is measurable such recognition generally occurs when the products reach the shipping point the sales price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured delivery is determined by the company’s shipping terms which are primarily freight on board shipping point revenue is recorded at the net amount to be received after deductions for estimated discounts allowances and returns these estimates and reserves are determined and adjusted as needed based upon historical experience contract terms and other related factors the shipping costs for the majority of the company’s sales are paid directly by the company’s customers in the broadband communications market approximately 6 of net sales in 2016 the company pays for shipping costs to the majority of its customers shipping costs are also paid by the company for certain customers in the interconnect products and assemblies segment amounts billed to customers related to shipping costs are immaterial and are included in net sales shipping costs incurred to transport products to the customer which are not reimbursed are included in selling general and administrative expenses 

  

inventories  inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost which approximates average cost or market provisions for slowmoving and obsolete inventory are made based on historical experience and product demand should future product demand change existing inventory could become slowmoving or obsolete and provisions would be increased accordingly 

  

depreciable assets  property plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation the appropriateness and the recoverability of the carrying value of such assets are periodically reviewed taking into consideration current and expected business conditions the company has not recorded any significant impairments 

  

goodwill  the company performs its evaluation for the impairment of goodwill for the company’s two reporting units on an annual basis or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that a reporting unit’s carrying amount may be impaired the company has defined its reporting units as the two reportable business segments “interconnect products and assemblies” and “cable products and solutions” as the components of these reportable business segments have similar economic characteristics in 2015 the company changed its annual assessment date for goodwill impairment to be as of july 1 rather than june 30 which had no impact on the outcome of the assessment 

  

in 2016 the company utilized the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it was necessary to perform the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment assessment as part of this assessment the company reviews qualitative factors which include but are not limited to economic market and industry conditions as well as the financial performance of each reporting unit in accordance with applicable guidance an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit if after assessing these qualitative factors the company determines that it is more likely than not that its reporting unit’s carrying value is less than its fair value as of july 1 2016 the company determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting units was greater than their carrying amounts 

  

in 2015 the company exercised its option to bypass the qualitative assessment and performed the first step of the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment assessment for each reportable business segment as part of the quantitative assessment the company estimated the fair value of each of its reportable business segments using a market approach the company believed this approach provided the best indicator of fair value by utilizing market prices and other relevant metrics for comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics and recent transactions of similar businesses within the industry significant estimates and assumptions were used in the company’s goodwill impairment assessment including revenue and profitability projections determination of appropriate publicly traded market comparison companies and comparable revenue and earnings multiples derived from 

 

comparable publicly traded companies and from recent acquisitions within our industry as part of our quantitative approach the company evaluated whether it was reasonably likely that changes to management’s estimates and assumptions would have a material impact on the results of the goodwill impairment assessment as of july 1 2015 we determined that the fair value of each of the company’s reportable business segments was substantially in excess of their respective carrying amounts and therefore no goodwill impairment resulted from the assessment 

  

the company has not recognized any goodwill impairment in 2016 2015 or 2014 in connection with its annual impairment assessment 

  

acquisitions  the company accounts for acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting which requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date the purchase price of acquisitions is allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values and any excess purchase price over the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill any subsequent adjustments to the purchase price allocation prior to the completion of the measurement period will be reflected as an adjustment to goodwill in the period in which the adjustments are identified the company may use independent valuation specialists to assist in determining the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed which could require certain significant management assumptions and estimates 

  

defined benefit plan obligation  the defined benefit plan obligation is based on significant assumptions such as mortality rates discount rates and plan asset rates of return as determined by the company in consultation with the respective benefit plan actuaries and investment advisors refer to note 7 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  

income taxes  deferred income taxes are provided for revenue and expenses which are recognized in different periods for income tax and financial statement reporting purposes at december 31 2016 the cumulative amount of undistributed earnings of foreign affiliated companies was approximately 41825 deferred income taxes are not provided on undistributed earnings of foreign affiliated companies as it is the company’s intention to reinvest these earnings permanently outside the us it is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if undistributed earnings were to be repatriated as there is a significant amount of uncertainty with respect to the tax impact of the remittance of these earnings due to the fact that dividends received from numerous foreign subsidiaries may generate additional foreign tax credits which could ultimately reduce the us tax cost of the dividend these uncertainties are further complicated by the significant number of foreign tax jurisdictions and entities involved deferred tax assets are regularly assessed for recoverability based on both historical and anticipated earnings levels and a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that these amounts will not be recovered the tax effects of an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns are recognized only if it is “more likely than not” to be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on its technical merits as of the reporting date the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement the company includes estimated interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes 

  

 

disclosures about contractual obligations and commitments 

  

the following table summarizes the company’s known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of december 31 2016 as well as an estimate of the timing in which such obligations are expected to be satisfied 

  





  



  



  



  

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

the company in the normal course of doing business is exposed to a variety of risks including market risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates the company does not have any significant concentration with any one counterparty 

  

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

  

the company conducts business in many international currencies through its worldwide operations and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the company’s sales gross margins and equity the company attempts to manage currency exposure risk in a number of ways including producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency cost reduction and pricing actions and working capital management however there can be no assurance that these actions will be fully effective in managing currency risk especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the company’s worldwide operations 

  

as of december 31 2016 the company had four forward contracts of varying amounts that effectively fixed euro great britain pound and korean won intercompany debt obligations into fixed hong kong dollar denominated obligations expiring at various times through 2017 concurrent with the underlying intercompany loans the fair value of the contracts at december 31 2016 resulted in a net asset of 84 a 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material effect on the value of the hedges as of december 31 2016 and 2015 the company does not engage in purchasing forward contracts for trading or speculative purposes 

  

refer to note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of derivative financial instruments 

  

interest rate risk 

  

the company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on the company’s financing activities the company manages its exposure to interest rate risk through a mix of fixed and variable rate debt in 2014 the company issued 7500 principal amount of unsecured 255 senior notes due january 2019 3750 principal amount of unsecured 155 senior notes due september 2017 and 3750 principal amount of unsecured 3125 senior notes due september 2021 the company used all of the net proceeds to repay the outstanding 6000 million 475 senior notes that were due in november 2014 and to repay amounts outstanding under its revolving credit facility and credit facilities 

  

any borrowings under the revolving credit facility either bear interest at or trade at rates that fluctuate with a spread over libor and any borrowings under the commercial paper program are subject to floating interest rates therefore when the company borrows under these debt instruments the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates as of december 31 2016 10244 or 34 of the company’s outstanding borrowings related mainly to its commercial paper program were subject to floating interest rates at december 31 2016 the company’s average floating rate on such borrowings was 106 a 10 change in this interest rate at december 31 2016 and 2015 would not have a material effect on interest expense the company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2017 although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not change significantly

the company is dependent on the communications industry including information technology and data communications wireless communications and broadband communications 

  

approximately 49 of the company’s 2015 net sales came from sales to the communications industry including information technology and data communication wireless communications and broadband communications with 19 of the company’s 2015 net sales coming from sales to the mobile device market demand for these products is subject to rapid technological change see below—“the company is dependent on the acceptance of new product introductions for continued revenue growth” these markets are dominated by several large manufacturers and operators who regularly exert significant pressure on their suppliers including the company furthermore there has been a trend on the part of oem customers to consolidate their lists of qualified suppliers to companies that have the ability to meet certain quality delivery and other standards while maintaining competitive prices there can be no assurance that the company will be able to meet these standards or maintain competitive pricing and therefore continue to compete successfully in the communications industry the company’s failure to do so could have an adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

  

approximately 6 and 8 of the company’s 2015 net sales came from sales to the broadband communications and mobile networks markets respectively demand for the company’s products in these markets depends primarily on capital spending by operators for constructing rebuilding or upgrading their systems the amount of this capital spending and therefore the company’s sales and profitability will be affected by a variety of factors including general economic conditions consolidation within the communications industry the financial condition of operators and their access to financing competition technological developments new legislation and regulation of operators there can be no assurance that existing levels of capital spending will continue or that spending will not decrease 

  

changes in defense expenditures may reduce the company’s sales 

  

approximately 10 of the company’s 2015 net sales came from sales to the military market the company participates in a broad spectrum of defense programs and believes that no one program accounted for more than 1 of its 2015 net sales the substantial majority of these sales are related to both us and foreign military and defense programs the company’s sales are generally to contractors and subcontractors of the us or foreign governments or to distributors that in turn sell to the contractors and subcontractors accordingly the company’s sales are affected by changes in the defense budgets of the us and foreign governments a significant decline in us defense expenditures and foreign government defense expenditures could have an adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

  

the company encounters competition in substantially all areas of its business 

  

the company competes primarily on the basis of technology innovation product quality price customer service and delivery time competitors include large diversified companies some of which have substantially greater assets and financial resources than the company as well as medium to small companies there can be no assurance that additional competitors will not enter the company’s existing markets nor can there be any assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against existing or new competition and the inability to do so could have an adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

  

the company is dependent on the acceptance of new product introductions for continued revenue growth 

  

the company estimates that products introduced in the last two years accounted for approximately 25 of 2015 net sales the company’s longterm results of operations depend substantially upon its ability to continue to conceive design source and market 

  

  

new products and upon continuing market acceptance of its existing and future product lines in the ordinary course of business the company continually develops or creates new product line concepts if the company fails to or is significantly delayed in introducing new product line concepts or if the company’s new products are not met with market acceptance its business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

  

covenants in the company’s credit agreements may adversely affect the company 

  

the credit agreement dated as of july 31 2013 among the company certain subsidiaries of the company and a syndicate of financial institutions the “revolving credit facility” and which also backstops the company’s commercial paper program contains financial and other covenants such as a limit on the ratio of debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization a limit on priority indebtedness and limits on incurrence of liens although the company believes none of these covenants is presently restrictive to the company’s operations the ability to meet the financial covenants can be affected by events beyond the company’s control and the company cannot provide assurance that it will meet those tests a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the revolving credit facility upon the occurrence of an event of default under any of the company’s credit facilities the lenders could elect to declare amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit if the lenders accelerate the repayment of borrowings the company may not have sufficient assets to repay the revolving credit facility and other indebtedness as of december 31 2015 the company had outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and the commercial paper program of nil and 8239 million respectively 

  

downgrades of the company’s credit rating could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

  

if the credit rating agencies that rate the company’s debt were to downgrade the company’s credit rating in conjunction with a deterioration of the company’s performance it may increase the company’s cost of capital and make it more difficult for the company to obtain new financing which could adversely affect the company’s business 

  

inability to access capital markets may adversely affect the company’s business 

  

the company’s ability to invest in its business and make strategic acquisitions requires access to the capital markets if general economic and capital market conditions deteriorate significantly it could impact the company’s ability to access the capital markets while the company has not encountered any financing difficulties the capital and credit markets have experienced significant volatility in recent years market conditions could make it more difficult to access capital to finance investments and acquisitions as such this could adversely affect the company’s results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

  

the company’s results may be negatively affected by changing interest rates 

  

the company is subject to interest rate volatility with regard to existing and future issuances of debt the company monitors the mix of fixedrate and variablerate debt as well as the mix of shortterm and longterm debt as of december 31 2015 8289 million or 29 of the company’s outstanding borrowings were subject to floating interest rates primarily due to changes in libor 

  

as of december 31 2015 the company had the following unsecured senior notes outstanding 

  

   

a 10 change in libor at december 31 2015 would have no material effect on the company’s interest expense the company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2016 although there can be no assurance that interest rates will not change significantly 

  

the company’s results may be negatively affected by foreign currency exchange rates 

  

the company conducts business in many international currencies through its worldwide operations and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies including possible currency devaluations changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the company’s sales gross margins and equity the company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk in a number of ways including producing its products in the same country or region in which the

  

  

products are sold thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency cost reduction and pricing actions and working capital management however there can be no assurance that these actions will be fully effective in managing currency risk especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the company’s worldwide operations which could have an adverse effect on the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

  

the company is subject to the risks of political economic and military instability in countries outside the united states 

  

nonus markets account for a substantial portion of the company’s business during 2015 nonus markets constituted approximately 70 of the company’s net sales with china constituting approximately 30 of the company’s net sales the company employs approximately 90 of its workforce outside the united states the company’s customers are located throughout the world and it has many manufacturing administrative and sales facilities outside the united states because the company has extensive nonus operations as well as significant cash and cash investments held at institutions located outside of the us it is exposed to risks that could negatively affect sales profitability or the liquidity of such cash and cash investments including 

  

·   tariffs trade barriers and trade disputes

the company may experience difficulties in obtaining a consistent supply of materials at stable pricing levels which could adversely affect its results of operations 

  

the company uses basic materials like aluminum steel copper titanium metal alloys gold silver certain rare earth metals and plastic resins in its manufacturing processes volatility in the prices of such materials and availability of supply may have a substantial impact on the price the company pays for such materials in addition to the extent such cost increases cannot be recovered through sales price increases or productivity improvements the company’s margins may decline 

  

the company may not be able to attract and retain key employees 

  

the company’s continued success depends upon its continued ability to hire and retain key employees at its operations around the world any difficulties in obtaining or retaining the management and other human resource competencies that the company needs to achieve its business objectives may have an adverse effect on the company’s performance

recent accounting pronouncements 

  

see note 1 of the notes to the company’s consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements 

  

pensions 

  

the company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans “us plans” which cover certain us employees and which represent the majority of the plan assets and benefit obligations of the aggregate defined benefit plans of the company the us plans’ benefits are generally based on years of service and compensation and are generally noncontributory certain us employees not covered by the us plans are covered by defined contribution plans certain foreign subsidiaries also have defined benefit plans covering their employees the “international plans” the pension expense for the us plans and international plans the “plans” approximated 310 224 and 301 in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively and is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions established on january 1 of the applicable year including a weightedaverage discount rate mortality projections rate of increase of future compensation levels and an expected longterm rate of return on the respective plans’ assets 

  

the discount rate used by the company for valuing pension liabilities is based on a review of high quality corporate bond yields with maturities approximating the remaining life of the projected benefit obligations the discount rate for the us plans on this basis was 411 at december 31 2015 and 375 at december 31 2014 the increase in the discount rate resulted in a decrease in the accrued benefit obligation for the us plans of approximately 190 at december 31 2015 at december 31 2015 the company elected to further refine its approach for calculating its service and interest costs beginning in 2016 by applying a split discount rate approach under which specific spot rates along the selected yield curve are applied to the relevant projected cash flows as the company believes this method more precisely measures its obligations the mortality assumptions used by the company reflect commonly used mortality tables and improvement scales for each plan and increased life expectancies for plan participants 

  

in developing the expected longterm rate of return assumption for the us plans the company evaluated input from its external actuaries and investment consultants as well as longterm inflation assumptions projected returns by such consultants are based on broad equity and bond indices the company also considered its historical twentyyear compounded return of approximately 9 which has been in excess of these broad equity and bond benchmark indices the expected longterm rate of return on the us plans’ assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of 60 with equity managers with an expected longterm rate of return of approximately 9 and 40 with fixed income managers with an expected longterm rate of return of approximately 6 the company believes that the longterm asset allocation on average will approximate 60 with equity managers and 40 with fixed income managers the company regularly reviews the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances investments to its targeted allocation when considered appropriate based on this methodology the company’s expected longterm rate of return assumption to determine the benefit obligation of the us plans at december 31 2015 and 2014 is 800 

  

  

the company made cash contributions to the plans of 241 238 and 233 in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively the total liability for accrued pension and postemployment benefit obligations under the company’s pension and postretirement benefit plans decreased in 2015 to 2660 37 of which is included in other accrued expenses primarily representing required contributions to be made during 2016 for unfunded foreign plans from 2793 in 2014 primarily due to an increase in the discount rate the company estimates that based on current actuarial calculations it will make a cash contribution to the plans in 2016 of approximately 220 most of which will be to the us plans cash contributions in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors including the investment performance of the respective plans’ assets 

  

the company offers various defined contribution plans for us and foreign employees participation in these plans is based on certain eligibility requirements the company matches the majority of employee contributions to the us defined contribution plans with cash contributions up to a maximum of 5 of eligible compensation the company provided matching contributions of approximately 42 38 and 30 in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates estimates are adjusted as new information becomes available the company’s critical accounting policies and estimates are set forth below the significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 of the notes to the company’s consolidated financial statements 

  

revenue recognition  the company’s primary source of revenues is from product sales to its customers revenue from sales of the company’s products is recognized at the time the goods are delivered title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership pass to the customer provided the earning process is complete and revenue is measurable such recognition generally occurs when the products reach the shipping point the sales price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured delivery is determined by the company’s shipping terms which are primarily freight on board shipping point revenue is recorded at the net amount to be received after deductions for estimated discounts allowances and returns these estimates and reserves are determined and adjusted as needed based upon historical experience contract terms and other related factors the shipping costs for the majority of the company’s sales are paid directly by the company’s customers in the broadband communications market approximately 6 of net sales in 2015 the company pays for shipping costs to the majority of its customers shipping costs are also paid by the company for certain customers in the interconnect products and assemblies segment amounts billed to customers related to shipping costs are immaterial and are included in net sales shipping costs incurred to transport products to the customer which are not reimbursed are included in selling general and administrative expenses

  

inventories  inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost which approximates average cost or market provisions for slowmoving and obsolete inventory are made based on historical experience and product demand should future product demand change existing inventory could become slowmoving or obsolete and provisions would be increased accordingly

  

depreciable assets  property plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation the appropriateness and the recoverability of the carrying value of such assets are periodically reviewed taking into consideration current and expected business conditions the company has not recorded any significant impairments

  

goodwill  annually the company performs its evaluation for the impairment of goodwill for the company’s two reporting units the company has defined its reporting units as the two reportable business segments “interconnect products and assemblies” and “cable products and solutions” as the components of these reportable business segments have similar economic characteristics in 2015 the company changed its annual assessment date for goodwill impairment to be as of july 1 rather than june 30 which had no impact on the outcome of the assessment

  

in 2014 the company utilized the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it was necessary to perform the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment assessment in accordance with applicable guidance an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the company determines based on a qualitative assessment of events and circumstances that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount the company had determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting units was greater than their carrying amounts 

  

in 2015 the company exercised its option to bypass the qualitative assessment and in the third quarter the company performed the first step of the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment assessment for each reportable business segment as part of the quantitative assessment the company estimated the fair value of each of its reportable business segments using a market approach the company believes this approach provides the best indicator of fair value by utilizing market prices and other relevant metrics for comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics and recent transactions of similar 

  

  

businesses within the industry significant estimates and assumptions were used in the company’s goodwill impairment assessment including revenue and profitability projections determination of appropriate publicly traded market comparison companies and comparable revenue and earnings multiples derived from comparable publicly traded companies and from recent acquisitions within our industry as part of our quantitative approach the company evaluated whether there were reasonably likely changes to management’s estimates and assumptions that would have a material impact on the results of the goodwill impairment assessment as of july 1 2015 we determined that the fair value of each of the company’s reportable business segments was substantially in excess of their respective carrying amounts and therefore no goodwill impairment resulted from the assessment 

  

the company has not recognized any goodwill impairment in 2015 2014 or 2013 in connection with its annual impairment assessment 

  

defined benefit plan obligation  the defined benefit plan obligation is based on significant assumptions such as mortality rates discount rates and plan asset rates of return as determined by the company in consultation with the respective benefit plan actuaries and investment advisors see note 7 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements

  

income taxes  deferred income taxes are provided for revenue and expenses which are recognized in different periods for income tax and financial statement reporting purposes at december 31 2015 the cumulative amount of undistributed earnings of foreign affiliated companies was approximately 3699 deferred income taxes are not provided on undistributed earnings of foreign affiliated companies as it is the company’s intention to reinvest these earnings permanently outside the us it is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if undistributed earnings were to be repatriated as there is a significant amount of uncertainty with respect to the tax impact of the remittance of these earnings due to the fact that dividends received from numerous foreign subsidiaries may generate additional foreign tax credits which could ultimately reduce the us tax cost of the dividend these uncertainties are further complicated by the significant number of foreign tax jurisdictions and entities involved deferred tax assets are regularly assessed for recoverability based on both historical and anticipated earnings levels and a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that these amounts will not be recovered the tax effects of an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns are recognized only if it is “more likely than not” to be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on its technical merits as of the reporting date the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement the company includes estimated interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes

  

  

disclosures about contractual obligations and commitments 

  

the following table summarizes the company’s known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of december 31 2015 as well as an estimate of the timing in which such obligations are expected to be satisfied 

  

   

1   the company has excluded expected interest payments on the revolving credit facility and commercial paper program from the above table as this calculation is largely dependent on average debt levels the company expects to have during each of the years presented the actual interest payments made related to the company’s revolving credit facility and commercial paper program in 2015 were 62 expected debt levels and therefore expected interest payments are difficult to predict as they are significantly impacted by such items as future acquisitions repurchases of treasury stock dividend payments as well as payments or additional borrowings made to reduce or increase the underlying revolver balance

  

2   included in this table are estimated benefit payments expected to be made under the company’s unfunded pension and postretirement benefit plans the company also maintains several funded pension and postretirement benefit plans the most significant of which covers its us employees over the past several years there has been no minimum requirement for company contributions to the us plans due to prior contributions made in excess of minimum requirements and as a result there was no anticipated minimum required contribution included in the table above related to the us plans for 2016 however the company did make a voluntary contribution to the us plans of approximately 150 in 2015 and anticipates making a similar voluntary contribution in 2016 it is not possible to reasonably estimate expected required contributions in the above table after 2016 since several assumptions are required to calculate minimum required contributions such as the discount rate and expected returns on pension assets

  

3   as of december 31 2015 the company has noncurrent liabilities of approximately 206 recognized in accordance with the income taxes topic of the accounting standards codification these liabilities have been excluded from the above table due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows it is difficult to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which all of these liabilities might be paid

  

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

the company in the normal course of doing business is exposed to a variety of risks including market risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 

  

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

  

the company conducts business in many international currencies through its worldwide operations and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the company’s sales gross margins and equity the company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk in a number of ways including producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency cost reduction and pricing actions and working capital management however there can be no assurance that these actions will be fully effective in managing currency risk especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the company’s worldwide operations

  

as of december 31 2015 the company had six forward contracts of varying amounts that effectively fixed euro great britain pound and korean won intercompany debt obligations into fixed hong kong dollar denominated obligations expiring at various times through 2017 concurrent with the underlying intercompany loans the fair value of the contracts at december 31 2015 resulted in a net asset of 33 a 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates at december 31 2015 would not have a material effect on the value of the hedges the company does not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for trading or speculative purposes 

  

refer to note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of derivative financial instruments 

  

interest rate risk 

  

the company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on the company’s financing activities the company manages its exposure to interest rate risk through a mix of fixed and variable rate debt in 2014 the company issued 7500 principal amount of unsecured 255 senior notes due january 2019 3750 principal amount of unsecured 155 senior notes due september 2017 and 3750 principal amount of unsecured 3125 senior notes due september 2021 the company used all of the net proceeds to repay the outstanding 6000 million 475 senior notes that were due in november 2014 and to repay amounts outstanding under its revolving credit facility and credit facilities which reduced the company’s interest expense 

  

any borrowings under the revolving credit facility and commercial paper program either bear interest at or trade at rates that fluctuate with a spread over libor therefore when the company borrows under these debt instruments the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates as of december 31 2015 8289 or 29 of the company’s outstanding borrowings related mainly to its commercial paper program were subject to floating interest rates primarily due to changes in libor at december 31 2015 the company’s average libor rate was 088 a 10 change in the libor interest rate at december 31 2015 would not have a material effect on interest expense the company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2016 although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not change significantly

approximately 7 and 11 of the company’s 2014 net sales came from sales to the broadband communications and mobile networks markets respectively demand for the company’s products in these markets depends primarily on capital spending by operators for constructing rebuilding or upgrading their systems the amount of this capital spending and therefore the company’s sales and profitability will be affected by a variety of factors including general economic conditions consolidation within the communications industry the financial condition of operators and their access to financing competition technological developments new legislation and regulation of operators there can be no assurance that existing levels of capital spending will continue or that spending will not decrease

ordinary course of business the company continually develops or creates new product line concepts if the company fails to or is significantly delayed in introducing new product line concepts or if the company’s new products are not met with market acceptance its business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

  

covenants in the company’s credit agreements may adversely affect the company

downgrades of the company’s credit rating could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition

inability to access capital markets may adversely affect the company’s business

as of december 31 2014 the company had the following unsecured senior notes outstanding 

  

   

a 10 change in libor at december 31 2014 would have no material effect on the company’s interest expense the company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2015 although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not change significantly 

  

  

the company’s results may be negatively affected by foreign currency exchange rates 

  

the company conducts business in many international currencies through its worldwide operations and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the company’s sales gross margins and equity the company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk in a number of ways including producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency cost reduction and pricing actions and working capital management however there can be no assurance that these actions will be fully effective in managing currency risk especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the company’s worldwide operations which could have an adverse effect on the company’s results of operations and financial condition

the company conducts business in many international currencies through its worldwide operations and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the company’s sales gross margins and equity the company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk in a number of ways including producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency cost reduction and pricing actions and working capital management however there can be no assurance that these actions will be fully effective in managing currency risk especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the company’s worldwide operations

pensions 

  

the company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans “us plans” which cover certain us employees and which represent the majority of the plan assets and benefit obligations of the aggregate defined benefit plans of the company the us plans’ benefits are generally based on years of service and compensation and are generally noncontributory certain us employees not covered by the us plans are covered by defined contribution plans certain foreign subsidiaries also have defined benefit plans covering their employees the “international plans” the pension expense for the us plans and international plans the “plans” approximated 224 301 and 252 in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively and is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions established on january 1 of the applicable year including a weightedaverage discount rate mortality projections rate increase of future compensation levels and an expected longterm rate of return on the respective plans’ assets 

  

the discount rate used by the company for valuing pension liabilities is based on a review of high quality corporate bond yields with maturities approximating the remaining life of the projected benefit obligations the discount rate for the us plans on this basis was 375 at december 31 2014 and 460 at december 31 2013 the mortality assumptions used by the company reflect commonly used mortality tables and improvement scales for each plan in 2014 the company considered the updated mortality tables and improvement scales recently issued by the society of actuaries along with other mortality information available to develop updated mortality assumptions for the us plans these updated mortality assumptions reflected increased life expectancies for plan participants the decrease in the discount rate and the updated mortality assumptions resulted in an increase in the accrued benefit obligation for the us plans of approximately 800 at december 312014 

  

in developing the expected longterm rate of return assumption for the us plans the company evaluated input from its external actuaries and investment consultants as well as longterm inflation assumptions projected returns by such consultants are based on broad equity and bond indices the company also considered its historical twentyyear compounded return of approximately 9 which has been in excess of these broad equity and bond benchmark indices the expected longterm rate of return on the us plans’ assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of 60 with equity managers with an expected longterm rate of return of approximately 9 and 40 with fixed income managers with an expected longterm rate of return of approximately 7 the company believes that the longterm asset allocation on average will approximate 60 with equity managers and 40 with fixed income managers the company regularly reviews the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances investments to its targeted allocation when considered appropriate based on this methodology the company’s expected longterm rate of return assumption to determine the accrued benefit obligation of the us plans at december 31 2014 and 2013 is 800 

  

the company made cash contributions to the plans of 238 233 and 218 in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively the total liability for accrued pension and postemployment benefit obligations under the company’s pension and postretirement benefit plans increased in 2014 to 2793 50 of which is included in other accrued expenses primarily representing required contributions to be made during 2015 for unfunded foreign plans from 1795 in 2013 primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate and update in mortality projections the company estimates that based on current actuarial calculations it will make a cash contribution to the plans in 2015 of approximately 220 most of which is related to the us plans cash contributions in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors including the investment performance of the respective plans’ assets 

  

the company offers various defined contribution plans for us and foreign employees participation in these plans is based on certain eligibility requirements the company matches the majority of employee contributions to the us defined contribution plans with cash contributions up to a maximum of 5 of eligible compensation the company provided matching contributions of approximately 38 30 and 27 in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively

disclosures about contractual obligations and commitments 

  

the following table summarizes the company’s known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of december 31 2014 as well as an estimate of the timing in which such obligations are expected to be satisfied 

  

   

1   the company has excluded expected interest payments on the revolving credit facility credit agreement and commercial paper program from the above table as this calculation is largely dependent on average debt levels the company expects to have during each of the years presented the actual interest payments made related to the company’s revolving credit facility credit agreement and commercial paper program in 2014 were 75 expected debt levels and therefore expected interest payments are difficult to predict as they are significantly impacted by such items as future acquisitions repurchases of treasury stock dividend payments as well as payments or additional borrowing made to reduce or increase the underlying revolver balance 

  

2   included in this table are estimated benefit payments expected to be made under the company’s unfunded pension and postretirement benefit plans the company also maintains several funded pension and postretirement benefit plans the most significant of which covers its us employees over the past several years there has been no minimum requirement for company contributions to the us plans due to prior contributions made in excess of minimum requirements however the company did make a voluntary contribution of approximately 150 in 2014 an anticipated minimum required contribution of approximately 97 was included in the above table related to the us plans for 2015 it is not possible to reasonably estimate expected required contributions in the above table after 2015 since several assumptions are required to calculate minimum required contributions such as the discount rate and expected returns on pension assets 

  

3   as of december 31 2014 the company has noncurrent liabilities of approximately 192 recognized in accordance with the income taxes topic of the accounting standards codification these liabilities have been excluded from the above table due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows it is difficult to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which all of these liabilities might be paid 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

the company in the normal course of doing business is exposed to a variety of risks including market risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 

  

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

  

the company conducts business in many international currencies through its worldwide operations and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the company’s sales gross margins and equity the company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk in a number of ways including producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency cost reduction and pricing actions and working capital management however there can be no assurance that these actions will be fully effective in managing currency risk especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the company’s worldwide operations 

  

as of december 31 2014 the company had five forward contracts of varying amounts that effectively fixed euro great britain pound and us dollar intercompany debt obligations into fixed hong kong dollar denominated obligations expiring 

  

  

at various times throughout 2015 concurrent with the underlying intercompany loans the fair value of the contracts at december 31 2014 resulted in an asset of 110 a 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates at december 31 2014 would not have a material effect on the value of hedge assets the company does not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for trading or speculative purposes 

  

refer to note 3 of the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of derivative financial instruments 

  

interest rate risk 

  

the company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on the company’s financing activities the company manages its exposure to interest rate risk through a proportion of fixed and variable rate debt in 2014 the company issued 7500 principal amount of unsecured 255 senior notes due january 2019 at 99846 of their face value 3750 principal amount of unsecured 155 senior notes due september 2017 at 99898 of their face value and 3750 principal amount of unsecured 3125 senior notes due september 2021 at 99912 of their face value the company used all of the net proceeds to repay the outstanding 6000 million 475 senior notes that were due in november 2014 and to repay amounts outstanding under its revolving credit facility and credit agreement which reduced the company’s interest expense 

  

throughout the year the company borrows under its revolving credit facility credit agreement and commercial paper program borrowings under these agreements either bear interest at or trade at rates that fluctuate with a spread over libor therefore when the company borrows under these debt instruments the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates as of december 31 2014 6710 or 25 of the company’s outstanding borrowings related mainly to its commercial paper program were subject to floating interest rates primarily due to changes in libor at december 31 2014 the company’s average libor rate was 038 a 10 change in the libor interest rate at december 31 2014 would not have a material effect on interest expense the company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2015 although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not change significantly

subsequent to the acquisition of amphenol corporation from allied signal corporation “allied signal” in 1987 allied signal merged with honeywell international inc in december 1999 “honeywell” the company and honeywell were named jointly and severally liable as potentially responsible parties in connection with several environmental cleanup sites the company and honeywell jointly consented to perform certain investigations and remediation and monitoring activities at the route 8 landfill and the richardson hill road landfill and they were jointly ordered to perform work at the sidney landfill all as referred to above all of the costs incurred relating to these three sites are currently reimbursed by honeywell based on an agreement the “honeywell agreement” entered into in connection with the acquisition in 1987 the environmental investigation remediation and monitoring activities identified by the company including those referred to above are covered under the honeywell agreement management does not believe that the costs associated with resolution of these or any other environmental matters will have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

since 1987 the company has not been identified or named as a potentially responsible party with respect to any other significant onsite or offsite hazardous waste matters in addition the company believes that its manufacturing activities and disposal practices since 1987 have been in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations nonetheless it is possible that the company will be named as a potentially responsible party in the future with respect to additional superfund or other sites although the company is unable to predict with any reasonable certainty the extent of its ultimate liability with respect to any pending or future environmental matters the company believes based upon information currently known by management about the company’s manufacturing activities disposal practices and estimates of liability with respect to known environmental matters that any such liability will not have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows

the company is dependent on the communications industry including information technology and data communications wireless communications and broadband communications 

  

approximately 56 of the company’s 2013 net sales came from sales to the communications industry including information technology and data communication wireless communications and broadband communications of which 19 of the company’s 2013 net sales came from sales to the mobile device market demand for these products is subject to rapid technological change see below—“the company is dependent on the acceptance of new product introductions for continued revenue growth” these markets are dominated by several large manufacturers and operators who regularly exert significant price pressure on their suppliers including the company there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to compete successfully in the communications industry and the company’s failure to do so could have an adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

  

approximately 8 and 10 of the company’s 2013 net sales came from sales to the broadband communications and mobile networks markets respectively demand for the company’s products in these markets depends primarily on capital spending by operators for constructing rebuilding or upgrading their systems the amount of this capital spending and therefore the company’s sales and profitability will be affected by a variety of factors including general economic conditions consolidation within the communications industry the financial condition of operators and their access to financing competition technological developments new legislation and regulation of operators there can be no assurance that existing levels of capital spending will continue or that spending will not decrease 

  

changes in defense expenditures may reduce the company’s sales 

  

approximately 12 of the company’s 2013 net sales came from sales to the military market the company participates in a broad spectrum of defense programs and believes that no one program accounted for more than 1 of its 2013 net sales the substantial majority of these sales are related to both us and foreign military and defense programs the company’s sales are generally to contractors and subcontractors of the us or foreign governments or to distributors that in turn sell to the contractors and subcontractors accordingly the company’s sales are affected by changes in the defense budgets of the us and foreign governments a significant decline in us defense expenditures and foreign government defense expenditures generally could adversely affect the company’s business and have an adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

  

the company encounters competition in substantially all areas of its business 

  

the company competes primarily on the basis of technology innovation product quality price customer service and delivery time competitors include large diversified companies some of which have substantially greater assets and financial resources than the company as well as medium to small companies there can be no assurance that additional competitors will not enter the company’s existing markets nor can there be any assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against existing or new competition and the inability to do so could have an adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

  

the company is dependent on the acceptance of new product introductions for continued revenue growth 

  

the company estimates that products introduced in the last two years accounted for approximately 20 of 2013 net sales the company’s longterm results of operations depend substantially upon its ability to continue to conceive design source and market new products and upon continuing market acceptance of its existing and future product lines in the ordinary course of business the company continually develops or creates new product line concepts if the company fails to or is significantly delayed in introducing new product line concepts or if the company’s new products do not meet with market acceptance its business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

  

covenants in the company’s credit agreements may adversely affect the company 

  

the credit agreement amended on july 1 2013 among the company certain subsidiaries of the company and a syndicate of financial institutions the “revolving credit facility” contains financial and other covenants such as a limit on the ratio of debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization a limit on priority indebtedness and limits on incurrence of liens although the company believes none of these covenants is presently restrictive to the company’s operations the ability to meet the financial covenants can be affected by events beyond the company’s control and the company cannot provide assurance that it will meet those tests a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the revolving credit facility upon the occurrence of an event of default under any of the company’s credit facilities the lenders could elect to declare amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit if the lenders accelerate the repayment of borrowings the company may not have sufficient assets to repay the revolving credit facility and other indebtedness 

  

  

downgrades of the company’s debt rating could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

  

if the credit rating agencies that rate the company’s debt were to downgrade the company’s credit rating in conjunction with a deterioration of the company’s performance it may increase the company’s cost of capital and make it more difficult for the company to obtain new financing which could adversely affect the company’s business 

  

the company’s results may be negatively affected by changing interest rates  

  

the company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on the company’s financing activities as of december 31 2013 10341 million or 48 of the company’s outstanding borrowings were subject to floating interest rates primarily libor the company has 6000 million of unsecured senior notes due november 2014 outstanding which were issued at 99813 of their face value and which have a fixed interest rate of 475 the “475 senior notes” the company has 5000 million of unsecured senior notes due february 2022 outstanding which were issued at 99746 of their face value and which have a fixed interest rate of 400 the “400 senior notes” additionally in january 2014 the company issued 7500 million of unsecured senior notes due january 2019 which were issued at 99846 of their face value and have a fixed interest rate of 255 the “255 senior notes” the company used the net proceeds from the sale of the 255 senior notes to repay borrowings under the company’s revolving credit facility which reduced the company’s interest rate exposure 

  

a 10 change in libor at december 31 2013 would have no material effect on the company’s interest expense the company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2014 although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly change 

  

the company’s results may be negatively affected by foreign currency exchange rates 

  

the company conducts business in many international currencies through its worldwide operations and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the company’s sales gross margins and equity the company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk in a number of ways including producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency cost reduction and pricing actions and working capital management however there can be no assurance that these actions will be fully effective in managing currency risk especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the company’s worldwide operations which could have an adverse effect on the company’s results of operations and financial conditions 

  

the company is subject to the risks of political economic and military instability in countries outside the united states including china

geographically sales in the us in 2013 increased approximately 4 14306 million in 2013 versus 13797 million in 2012 compared to 2012 international sales for 2013 increased approximately 9 in us dollars and in local currencies 31841 million in 2013 versus 29124 million in 2012 compared to 2012 with particular strength in europe the comparatively weaker us dollar in 2013 had the effect of increasing net sales by approximately 154 million when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2012 

  

the gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was 315 in 2013 compared to 313 in 2012 the increase in gross profit margin as a percentage of sales relates primarily to higher margins in the interconnect products and assemblies segment due primarily to increased volume and cost reduction actions operating margin in the interconnect products and assemblies segment was 218 

  

  

and 215 of sales in 2013 and 2012 respectively operating margin in the cable products and solutions segment decreased to 134 in 2013 from 135 of sales in 2012 primarily as a result of market pricing and product mix on a consolidated basis operating income margin was 194 up 10 basis points from 2012 which included the impact of acquisitionrelated expenses discussed below 

  

as separately presented in the consolidated statements of income the company incurred 60 million and 20 million of acquisitionrelated expenses in 2013 and 2012 respectively in connection with acquisitions made during each of these respective years these expenses include professional fees transactionrelated fees and other external expenses for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 these expenses had an impact on net income of 46 million or 002 per share and 20 million or 001 per share respectively excluding the effect of these expenses operating income margin was 196 in 2013 compared to 193 in 2012

interest expense was 636 million for 2013 compared to 596 million for 2012 the increase is primarily attributed to higher average debt levels from the company’s acquisitions and stock repurchase programs 

  

other income net was 134 million for 2013 compared to 101 million for 2012 primarily related to interest income on higher levels of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

  

the provision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 246 in 2013 and 282 in 2012 the 2013 tax rate reflects a decrease in tax expense and the 2012 tax rate reflects an increase in tax expense of 113 million or 007 per diluted common share resulting from the delay by the us government in the reinstatement of certain federal income tax provisions for the year 2012 relating primarily to research and development credits and certain us taxes on foreign income that are part of the tax provisions within the american taxpayer relief act such tax provisions were reinstated on january 2 2013 with retroactive effect to 2012 under us gaap the benefit to the company of 113 million relating to the 2012 tax year was recorded as a benefit in the first quarter of 2013 at the date of reinstatement as such between the fourth quarter of 2012 and the first quarter of 2013 there is no net impact on the company from an income statement perspective the 2013 tax rate also reflects a reduction in tax expense of 36 million for tax reserve adjustments relating to the completion of the audits of certain of the company’s prior year tax returns excluding these impacts as well as the net impact of the acquisitionrelated expenses the company’s effective tax rate for 2013 and 2012 was 263 and 267 respectively 

  

the company operates in over sixty tax jurisdictions and at any point in time has numerous audits underway at various stages of completion with few exceptions the company is subject to income tax examinations by tax authorities for the years 2010 and after the company is generally not able to precisely estimate the ultimate settlement amounts or timing until the close of an audit the company evaluates its tax positions and establishes liabilities for uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local authorities and may not be fully sustained despite the company’s belief that the underlying tax positions are fully supportable as of december 31 2013 the amount of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits which if recognized would impact the effective tax rate was approximately 149 million the majority of which is included in other longterm liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets unrecognized tax benefits are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted for changing facts and circumstances including progress of tax audits and closing of statute of limitations based on information currently available management anticipates that over the next twelve month period audit activity could be completed and statutes of limitations may close relating to existing unrecognized tax benefits of approximately 18 million

the gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was 313 in 2012 compared to 316 in 2011 the decrease in gross profit margin as a percentage of sales relates primarily to lower margins in the interconnect products and assemblies segment due primarily to product mix partially offset by increased margins in the cable products and solutions segment primarily as a result of higher volumes and favorable product mix from an acquisition in 2012 operating margin in the interconnect product and assemblies segment was 215 of sales in both 2012 and 2011 as the lower gross margin was offset by lower selling general and administrative expenses operating margin in the cable products and solutions segment increased to 135 in 2012 from 127 of sales in 2011 primarily as a result of higher gross margins on a consolidated basis operating margins improved from 191 in 2011 to 193 in 2012

interest expense was 596 million for 2012 compared to 430 million for 2011 the increase is primarily attributed to higher average debt levels related to the stock repurchases made under the 2011 program and higher average borrowing costs due primarily to the issuance of the 400 senior notes in january 2012 

  

other income net was 101 million for 2012 compared to 81 million for 2011 primarily related to interest income on higher levels of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

  

the provision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 282 in 2012 and 262 in 2011 the 2012 tax rate reflects an increase in tax expense of 113 million or 007 per diluted common share resulting from the delay by the us government in the reinstatement of certain federal income tax provisions for the year 2012 relating primarily to research and development credits and certain us taxes on foreign income that are part of the tax provisions within the american taxpayer relief act such tax provisions were reinstated on january 2 2013 with retroactive effect to 2012 under us gaap the benefit to the company of 113 million relating to the 2012 tax year will be recorded as a benefit in the first quarter of 2013 at the date of reinstatement as such between the fourth quarter of 2012 and the first quarter of 2013 there is no net impact on the company from an income statement perspective the 2011 tax rate reflects a decrease of 45 million relating primarily to reserve adjustments from the favorable settlement of certain tax positions and the completion of prior year audits excluding these impacts as well as the net impact of the acquisitionrelated expenses the loss incurred related to the 2011 sidney flood and the 2011 contingent consideration gain the company’s effective tax rate for 2012 and 2011 was 267 and 268 respectively

environmental matters 

  

certain operations of the company are subject to environmental laws and regulations which govern the discharge of pollutants into the air and water as well as the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes the company believes that its operations are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that the costs of continuing compliance will not have a material effect on the company’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

owners and occupiers of sites containing hazardous substances as well as generators of hazardous substances are subject to broad liability under various environmental laws and regulations including expenditures for cleanup and monitoring costs and potential damages arising out of past disposal activities such liability in many cases may be imposed regardless of fault or the legality of the original disposal activity the company has performed remediation activities and is currently performing operations and maintenance and monitoring activities at three offsite disposal sites previously utilized by the company’s facility in sidney new york and others  the richardson hill road landfill the route 8 landfill and the sidney landfill actions at the richardson hill road and sidney landfills were undertaken subsequent to designation as “superfund” sites on the national priorities list under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 the route 8 landfill was designated as a new york state inactive hazardous waste disposal site with remedial actions taken pursuant to chapter 6 section 3751 of the new york code of rules and regulations in addition the company is currently performing monitoring activities at and in proximity to its manufacturing site in sidney new york the company is also engaged in remediating or monitoring environmental conditions at certain of its other manufacturing facilities and has been named as a potentially responsible party for cleanup costs at other offsite disposal sites

inflation and costs 

  

the cost of the company’s products is influenced by the cost of a wide variety of raw materials including precious metals such as gold and silver used in plating aluminum copper brass and steel used for contacts shells and cable and plastic materials used in molding connector bodies inserts and cable the company strives to offset the impact of increases in the cost of raw materials labor and services through price increases productivity improvements and cost saving programs however in certain markets particularly in the communications related markets this can be difficult and there is no guarantee that the company will be successful 

  

foreign exchange 

  

the company conducts business in many international currencies through its worldwide operations and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the company’s sales gross margins and equity the company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk in a number of ways including producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency cost reduction and pricing actions and working capital management however there can be no assurance that these actions will be fully effective in managing currency risk especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the company’s worldwide operations 

  

recent accounting pronouncements 

  

in march 2013 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update “asu” 201305 parent’s accounting for the cumulative translation adjustment upon derecognition of certain subsidiaries or groups of assets within a foreign entity or of an investment in a foreign entity “asu 201305” which clarifies preexisting guidance regarding the treatment of cumulative translation adjustments when a parent sells part or all of its investment in a foreign entity asu 201305 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2013 however early adoption is permitted the company does not expect that the adoption of this update will have a significant effect on its financial statements 

  

in february 2013 the fasb issued asu 201302 reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income “asu 201302” the update requires disclosure of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in addition an entity is required to present either on the face of the consolidated statements of income or in the notes significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income but only if the amount reclassified is required to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period for amounts not reclassified in their entirety to net income an entity is required to crossreference to other disclosures that provide additional detail about those amounts asu 201302 was effective prospectively for the company for the first quarter of 2013 because this standard only impacts presentation and disclosure requirements its adoption did not have a significant effect on the company’s financial statements 

  

pensions 

  

the company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans “us plans” which cover certain us employees and which represent the majority of the plan assets and benefit obligations of the aggregate defined benefit plans of the company the us plans’ benefits are generally based on years of service and compensation and are generally noncontributory certain us employees not covered by the us plans are covered by defined contribution plans certain foreign subsidiaries also have defined benefit plans covering their employees the “international plans” the pension expense for the us plans and international plans the “plans” approximated 301 million 252 million and 191 million in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively and is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions established on january 1 of the applicable year including a weightedaverage discount rate rate increase of future compensation levels and an expected longterm rate of return on the respective plans’ assets 

  

the discount rate used by the company for valuing pension liabilities is based on a review of high quality corporate bond yields with maturities approximating the remaining life of the projected benefit obligations the discount rate for the us plans on this basis was 460 at december 31 2013 and 375 at december 31 2012 although future changes to the discount rate are unknown had the discount rate increased or decreased 50 basis points the accrued benefit obligation would have decreased or increased by approximately 200 million 

  

in developing the expected longterm rate of return assumption for the us plans the company evaluated input from its external actuaries and investment consultants as well as longterm inflation assumptions projected returns by such consultants are based on broad equity and bond indices the company also considered its historical twentyyear compounded return of approximately 9 which has been in excess of these broad equity and bond benchmark indices as described above the expected longterm rate of return on the us plans’ assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of 60 with equity managers with an expected longterm rate of 

  

  

return of approximately 9 and 40 with fixed income managers with an expected longterm rate of return of approximately 7 as of december 31 2013 and 2012 the asset allocation was 65 and 62 with equity managers and 32 and 37 with fixed income managers and 3 and 1 in cash respectively the company believes that the longterm asset allocation on average will approximate 60 with equity managers and 40 with fixed income managers the company regularly reviews the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances investments to its targeted allocation when considered appropriate based on this methodology the company’s expected longterm rate of return assumption to determine the accrued benefit obligation of the us plans at december 31 2013 and 2012 is 800 

  

the company made cash contributions to the plans of 233 million 218 million and 228 million in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively the total liability for accrued pension and postemployment benefit obligations under the company’s pension and postretirement benefit plans decreased in 2013 to 1795 million 40 million of which is included in other accrued expenses primarily representing required contributions to be made during 2014 for unfunded foreign plans from 2466 million in 2012 primarily due to an increase of the discount rate assumption compared to 2012 the company estimates that based on current actuarial calculations it will make a cash contribution to the plans in 2014 of approximately 220 million most of which is related to the us plans cash contributions in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors including the investment performance of the respective plans’ assets 

  

the company offers various defined contribution plans for us and foreign employees participation in these plans is based on certain eligibility requirements the company matches the majority of employee contributions to the us defined contribution plans with cash contributions up to a maximum of 5 of eligible compensation the company provided matching contributions of approximately 30 million 27 million and 25 million in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates

income taxes  deferred income taxes are provided for revenue and expenses which are recognized in different periods for income tax and financial statement reporting purposes at december 31 2013 the cumulative amount of undistributed earnings of foreign affiliated companies was approximately 26 billion deferred income taxes are not provided on undistributed earnings of foreign affiliated companies as it is the company’s intention to reinvest these earnings permanently outside the us it is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if undistributed earnings were to be repatriated as there is a significant amount of uncertainty with respect to the tax impact of the remittance of these earnings due to the fact that dividends received from foreign subsidiaries may generate additional foreign tax credits which could ultimately reduce the us tax cost of the dividend these uncertainties are further complicated by the significant number of foreign tax jurisdictions involved deferred tax assets are regularly assessed for recoverability based on both historical and anticipated earnings levels and a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that these amounts will not be recovered the tax effects of an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns are recognized only if it is “more likely than not” to be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on its technical merits as of the reporting date the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement the company includes estimated interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes 

  

the significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 to the company’s consolidated financial statements 

  

disclosures about contractual obligations and commitments 

  

the following table summarizes the company’s known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of december 31 2013 as well as an estimate of the timing in which such obligations are expected to be satisfied 

  

 

  

1   the company has excluded expected interest payments on the revolving credit facility and credit agreement from the above table as this calculation is largely dependent on average debt levels the company expects to have during each of the years presented the actual interest payments made related to the revolving credit facility credit agreement and receivables securitization facility in 2013 were 106 million expected debt levels and therefore expected interest payments are difficult to predict as they are significantly impacted by such items as future acquisitions repurchases of treasury stock dividend payments as well as payments or additional borrowing made to reduce or increase the underlying revolver balance 

  

additionally the company has excluded the expected interest payments on the 255 senior notes which were issued in january 2014 and are due in january 2019 the net proceeds from the sale of the 255 senior notes were used to repay borrowings under the revolving credit facility the company expects to make annual interest payments of approximately 191 million until maturity of the 255 senior notes 

  

2   included in this table are estimated benefit payments expected to be made under the company’s unfunded pension and postretirement benefit plans the company also maintains several funded pension and postretirement benefit plans the most significant of which covers its us employees over the past several years there has been no minimum requirement for company contributions to the us plans due to prior contributions made in excess of minimum requirements however the company did make a voluntary contribution of approximately 150 million in 2013 an anticipated minimum required contribution of approximately 90 million was included in the above table related to the us plans for 2014 it is not possible to reasonably estimate expected required contributions in the above table after 2014 since several assumptions are required to calculate minimum required contributions such as the discount rate and expected returns on pension assets 

  

3   as of december 31 2013 the company has noncurrent liabilities of approximately 149 million recognized in accordance with the income taxes topic of the accounting standards codification these liabilities have been excluded from the above table due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows it is difficult to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid

if actions taken by management to limit monitor or control financial enterprise risk exposures are not successful the company’s business and consolidated financial statements could be materially adversely affected in such case the trading price of the company’s common stock could decline and investors may lose all or part of their investment 

  

the company is dependent on the communications industry including information technology and data communications wireless communications and broadband communications 

  

approximately 57 of the company’s 2012 revenues came from sales to the communications industry including information technology and data communication wireless communications and broadband communications of which 20 of the company’s 2012 revenues came from sales to the wireless device market demand for these products is subject to rapid technological change see below—“the company is dependent on the acceptance of new product introductions for continued revenue growth” these markets are dominated by several large manufacturers and operators who regularly exert significant price pressure on their suppliers including the company there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to compete successfully in the communications industry and the company’s failure to do so could have an adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

  

approximately 7 and 10 of the company’s 2012 revenues came from sales to the broadband communications and wireless infrastructure markets respectively demand for the company’s products in these markets depends primarily on capital spending by operators for constructing rebuilding or upgrading their systems the amount of this capital spending and therefore the company’s sales and profitability will be affected by a variety of factors including general economic conditions consolidation within the communications industry the financial condition of operators and their access to financing competition technological developments new legislation and regulation of operators there can be no assurance that existing levels of capital spending will continue or that spending will not decrease 

  

changes in defense expenditures may reduce the company’s sales 

  

approximately 14 of the company’s 2012 revenues came from sales to the military market the company participates in a broad spectrum of defense programs and believes that no one program accounted for more than 1 of its 2012 revenues the substantial majority of these sales are related to both us and foreign military and defense programs the company’s sales are generally to contractors and subcontractors of the us or foreign governments or to distributors that in turn sell to the contractors and subcontractors accordingly the company’s sales are affected by changes in the defense budgets of the us and foreign governments a significant decline in us defense expenditures and foreign government defense expenditures generally could adversely affect the company’s business and have an adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

  

the company encounters competition in substantially all areas of its business 

  

the company competes primarily on the basis of technology innovation product quality price customer service and delivery time competitors include large diversified companies some of which have substantially greater assets and financial resources than the company as well as medium to small companies there can be no assurance that additional competitors will not enter the company’s existing markets nor can there be any assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against existing or new competition and the inability to do so could have an adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

  

the company is dependent on the acceptance of new product introductions for continued revenue growth 

  

the company estimates that products introduced in the last two years accounted for approximately 24 of 2012 net sales the company’s longterm results of operations depend substantially upon its ability to continue to conceive design source and market new products and upon continuing market acceptance of its existing and future product lines in the ordinary course of business the company continually develops or creates new product line concepts if the company fails to or is significantly delayed in introducing new product line concepts or if the company’s new products do not meet with market acceptance its business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

  

covenants in the company’s credit agreements may adversely affect the company 

  

the credit agreement amended on june 30 2011 among the company certain subsidiaries of the company and a syndicate of financial institutions the “revolving credit facility” contains financial and other covenants such as a limit on the ratio of debt to 

  

  

earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization a limit on priority indebtedness and limits on incurrence of liens although the company believes none of these covenants is presently restrictive to the company’s operations the ability to meet the financial covenants can be affected by events beyond the company’s control and the company cannot provide assurance that it will meet those tests a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the revolving credit facility upon the occurrence of an event of default under any of the company’s credit facilities the lenders could elect to declare amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit if the lenders accelerate the repayment of borrowings the company may not have sufficient assets to repay the revolving credit facility and other indebtedness 

  

downgrades of the company’s debt rating could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

  

if the credit rating agencies that rate the company’s debt were to downgrade the company’s credit rating in conjunction with a deterioration of the company’s performance it may increase the company’s cost of capital and make it more difficult for the company to obtain new financing which could adversely affect the company’s business 

  

the company’s results may be negatively affected by changing interest rates  

  

the company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on the company’s financing activities as of december 31 2012 6081 million or 36 of the company’s outstanding borrowings were subject to floating interest rates primarily libor the company has 6000 million of unsecured senior notes due november 2014 outstanding which were issued at 99813 of their face value and which have a fixed interest rate of 475 the “475 senior notes” the company has 5000 million of unsecured senior notes due february 2022 outstanding which were issued at 99746 of their face value and which have a fixed interest rate of 400 the “400 senior notes” 

  

a 10 change in libor at december 31 2012 would have no material effect on the company’s interest expense the company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2013 although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly change 

  

the company’s results may be negatively affected by foreign currency exchange rates 

  

the company conducts business in many international currencies through its worldwide operations and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the company’s sales gross margins and equity the company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk in a number of ways including producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency cost reduction and pricing actions and working capital management however there can be no assurance that these actions will be fully effective in managing currency risk especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the company’s worldwide operations which could have an adverse effect on the company’s results of operations and financial conditions 

  

the company is subject to the risks of political economic and military instability in countries outside the united states 

  

nonus markets account for a substantial portion of the company’s business during 2012 nonus markets constituted approximately 68 of the company’s net sales the company employs more than 90 of its workforce outside the united states the company’s customers are located throughout the world and it has many manufacturing administrative and sales facilities outside the united states because the company has extensive nonus operations as well as significant cash and cash investments held at institutions located outside of the us it is exposed to risks that could negatively affect sales profitability or the liquidity of such cash and cash investments including 

  

·   tariffs trade barriers and trade disputes 

·   regulations related to customs and importexport matters

the company may experience difficulties in obtaining a consistent supply of materials at stable pricing levels which could adversely affect its results of operations 

  

the company uses basic materials like steel aluminum brass copper bimetallic products silver gold and plastic resins in its manufacturing processes volatility in the prices of such material and availability of supply may have a substantial impact on the price the company pays for such materials in addition to the extent such cost increases cannot be recovered through sales price increases or productivity improvements the company’s margin may decline 

  

the company may not be able to attract and retain key employees 

  

the company’s continued success depends upon its continued ability to hire and retain key employees at its operations around the world any difficulties in obtaining or retaining the management and other human resource competencies that the company needs to achieve its business objectives may have an adverse effect on the company’s performance 

  

changes in general economic conditions and other factors beyond the company’s control may adversely impact its business 

  

the following factors could adversely impact the company’s business 

  

·   a global economic slowdown in any of the company’s market segments

results of operations 

  

the following table sets forth the components of net income attributable to amphenol corporation as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated 

  

   

  

2012 compared to 2011 

  

net sales were 42921 million for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to 39398 million for the year ended december 31 2011 an increase of 9 in us dollars 10 in local currencies and 5 organically excluding both currency and acquisition impacts sales in the interconnect products and assemblies segment in 2012 approximately 93 of net sales increased 9 in us dollars 10 in local currencies and 5 organically compared to 2011 39873 million in 2012 versus 36660 million in 2011 the company achieved strong organic growth in the automotive industrial mobile devices information technology “it” and data communication equipment and commercial aerospace markets sales to the automotive market increased approximately 1217 million driven primarily by acquisitions and growth in new electronics applications industrial market sales increased approximately 792 million primarily reflecting acquisitions and increased sales to the alternative energy and oil and gas markets sales to the mobile devices market increased approximately 696 million primarily due to increased demand on new mobile computing platforms sales to the it and data communication equipment market increased approximately 636 million primarily due to increased sales of high speed and power products in latest generation servers sales to the commercial aerospace market increased approximately 380 million primarily due to higher airplane production volumes as well as new airplane platforms this was partially offset by reductions in sales to the military aerospace market approximately 229 million primarily due to reductions in procurement by defense contractors related to budget uncertainties and a reduction in sales to the wireless infrastructure market approximately 266 million primarily due to slowed demand at base stationequipment manufacturers sales in the cable products segment in 2012 approximately 7 of net sales increased 11 in us dollars 14 in local currencies and 8 organically compared to 2011 3048 million in 2012 versus 2737 million in 2011 organic growth was primarily due to increased demand in broadband markets 

  

geographically sales in the us in 2012 increased approximately 9 13797 million in 2012 versus 12689 million in 2011 compared to 2011 international sales for 2012 increased approximately 9 in us dollars and 11 in local currencies 29124 million in 2012 versus 26709 million in 2011 compared to 2011 with particular strength in asia the comparatively stronger us dollar in 2012 had the effect of decreasing net sales by approximately 483 million when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2011 

  

the gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was 313 in 2012 compared to 316 in 2011 the decrease in gross profit margin as a percentage of sales relates primarily to lower margins in the interconnect products and assemblies segment due primarily to product mix partially offset by increased margins in the cable products segment primarily as a result of higher volumes and favorable product mix from an acquisition in 2012 operating margin in the interconnect product and assemblies segment was 215 of sales in both 2012 and 2011 as the lower gross margin was offset by lower selling general and administrative expenses operating margin in the cable products segment increased to 135 in 2012 from 127 of sales in 2011 primarily as a result of higher gross margins on a consolidated basis operating margins improved from 191 in 2011 to 193 in 2012 

  

as separately presented in the consolidated statements of income the company incurred 20 million of acquisitionrelated expenses in both 2012 and 2011 in connection with acquisitions made during each of these respective years for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 these expenses had an impact of 20 million and 18 million on net income respectively or 001 per share for each year 

  

selling general and administrative expenses were 5129 million and 4863 million in 2012 and 2011 selling general and administrative expenses increased approximately 5 in 2012 over 2011 compared to a 9 increase in sales and therefore declined as a percentage of sales from 124 in 2011 to 120 in 2012 the decrease as a percentage of sales relates primarily to cost control actions and product mix administrative expenses increased approximately 245 million in 2012 primarily related to increases in stockbased compensation expense salaries and employeerelated benefits and amortization of acquisition related identified intangible assets and represented approximately 47 and 45 of sales for 2012 and 2011 respectively research and development expenditures increased approximately 36 million in 2012 reflecting increases in expenditures for new product development and represented approximately 22 and 23 of sales for 2012 and 2011 respectively selling and marketing expenses in 2012 were consistent with amounts incurred in 2011 and represented approximately 51 and 56 of sales for 2012 and 2011 respectively 

  

interest expense was 596 million for 2012 compared to 430 million for 2011 the increase is primarily attributed to higher average debt levels related to the stock repurchases made under the 2011 program and higher average borrowing costs due primarily to the issuance of the 400 senior notes in january 2012 

  

other income net was 101 million for 2012 compared to 81 million for 2011 primarily related to interest income on higher levels of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

  

the provision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 282 in 2012 and 262 in 2011 the 2012 tax rate reflects an increase in tax expense of 113 million or 007 per diluted common share resulting from the delay by the us government in the reinstatement of certain federal income tax provisions for the year 2012 relating primarily to research and development credits and certain us taxes on foreign income that are part of the tax provisions within the american taxpayer relief act such tax provisions were reinstated on january 2 2013 with retroactive effect to 2012 under 

  

  

us gaap the related benefit to the company of 113 million relating to the 2012 tax year will be recorded as a benefit in the first quarter of 2013 at the date of reinstatement as such between the fourth quarter of 2012 and the first quarter of 2013 there is no net impact on the company from an income statement perspective the 2011 tax rate reflects a decrease of 45 million relating primarily to reserve adjustments from the favorable settlement of certain tax positions and the completion of prior year audits excluding these adjustments as well as the net impact of the acquisition related expenses the loss incurred related to the 2011 sidney flood and the 2011 contingent consideration gain the company’s effective tax rate for 2012 and 2011 was 267 and 268 respectively 

  

the company operates in over sixty tax jurisdictions and at any point in time has numerous audits underway at various stages of completion with few exceptions the company is subject to income tax examinations by tax authorities for the years 2009 and after the company is generally not able to precisely estimate the ultimate settlement amounts or timing until the close of an audit the company evaluates its tax positions and establishes liabilities for uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local authorities and may not be fully sustained despite the company’s belief that the underlying tax positions are fully supportable as of december 31 2012 the amount of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits which if recognized would impact the effective tax rate was approximately 162 million the majority of which is included in other longterm liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets unrecognized tax benefits are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted for changing facts and circumstances including progress of tax audits and closing of statute of limitations based on information currently available management anticipates that over the next twelve month period audit activity could be completed and statutes of limitations may close relating to existing unrecognized tax benefits of approximately 56 million 

  

2011 compared to 2010 

  

net sales were 39398 million for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to 35541 million for 2010 an increase of 11 in us dollars 9 in local currencies and 6 organically excluding both currency and acquisition impacts sales in the interconnect products and assemblies segment in 2011 approximately 93 of net sales increased 11 in us dollars 10 in local currencies and 7 organically compared to 2010 36660 million in 2011 versus 32931 million in 2010 driven by strength in the wireless devices automotive industrial and commercial aerospace markets sales to the wireless devices market increased approximately 1954 million primarily due to increased smart wireless device and tablet computer demand sales to the automotive market increased approximately 1010 million driven primarily by new electronics applications as well as from the impact of two acquisitions made during the year industrial market sales increased approximately 713 million primarily reflecting increased sales to alternative energy oil and gas and heavy equipment markets sales to the commercial aerospace market increased approximately 360 million primarily due to higher airplane production volumes as well as next generation jet liner production this was partially offset by reductions in sales to the military aerospace market approximately 95 million primarily due to reductions in procurement by defense contractors related to budget uncertainties and also due to the approximately 180 million business interruption impact from the flood at the company’s sidney new york facility in early september 2011 as further described below the “flood impact” partially offset by acquisition growth from a 2010 acquisition and a reduction in sales to the wireless infrastructure market approximately 217 million primarily due to slowed demand at base stationequipment manufacturers sales in the cable products segment in 2011 approximately 7 of net sales increased 5 in us dollars and 3 in local currencies compared to 2010 2737 million in 2011 versus 2610 million in 2010 primarily due to increased spending in south american wireless infrastructure markets during the year partially offset by lower spending in broadband communications markets 

  

geographically sales in the us in 2011 increased approximately 1 12689 million in 2011 versus 12582 million in 2010 compared to 2010 international sales for 2011 increased approximately 16 in us dollars and 14 in local currencies 26709 million in 2011 versus 22960 million in 2010 compared to 2010 with particular strength in asia the comparatively weaker us dollar in 2011 had the effect of increasing net sales by approximately 596 million when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2010 

  

the gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was 316 in 2011 compared to 326 in 2010 the operating margin for the interconnect products and assemblies segment decreased approximately 05 compared to the prior year as a result of the impacts of increases in input costs primarily due to higher commodity prices these impacts were partially offset by the positive impacts of higher volume cost reduction actions and price increases the operating margins for the cable products segment decreased 09 primarily as a result of higher relative material costs 

  

the company incurred damage at its sidney new york manufacturing facility as a result of severe and sudden flooding in new york state in early september 2011 as separately presented in the consolidated statements of income the company recorded a charge of 215 million 135 million after taxes or 008 per share for propertyrelated damage as well as cleanup and repair efforts incurred through december 31 2011 net of insurance recoveries this charge includes the company’s loss for damaged inventory and machinery and equipment the sidney new york manufacturing facility had limited manufacturing and sales activity primarily during the third quarter of 2011 but the plant was substantially back to full production by the end of the fourth quarter of 2011 

  

  

during the year ended december 31 2011 the company reassessed based on current 2011 performance expectations a contingent acquisitionrelated obligation which would have been payable in 2012 related to a 2010 acquisition note 3 performance expectations were reduced as a result of a softening in demand in the defense market and the related deferral of certain defense related programs to periods beyond 2011 and therefore outside the contractual earnout period therefore it was determined that the payment related to 2011 profitability levels was no longer probable and the company adjusted the remaining contingent consideration liability of 178 million as a gain in operating income as separately presented in the consolidated statements of income based on the actual 2011 results of the acquired company it has been determined that the 2012 contingent consideration payment is in fact not payable this adjustment had an impact of 112 million on net income or 006 per share for the year ended december 31 2011 

  

as separately presented in the consolidated statements of income the company incurred 20 million of acquisitionrelated expenses in 2011 or 001 per share in connection with an acquisition made in the fourth quarter in the interconnect products and assemblies segment 

  

selling general and administrative expenses were 4863 million and 4579 million in 2011 and 2010 or approximately 12 and 13 of net sales for 2011 and 2010 respectively selling and marketing expenses increased approximately 104 million in 2011 due primarily to the higher sales volume and the impact on related costs such as freight and employeerelated costs research and development expenditures increased approximately 113 million in 2011 reflecting increases in expenditures for new product development and represented approximately 2 of sales for both 2011 and 2010 administrative expenses increased approximately 67 million in 2011 primarily related to increases in stockbased compensation expense salaries and employeerelated benefits and amortization of acquisition related identified intangible assets and represented approximately 5 of sales for both 2011 and 2010 

  

interest expense was 430 million for 2011 compared to 407 million for 2010 the increase is primarily attributed to higher average debt levels related to the company’s stock repurchase program note 7 partially offset by lower average borrowing costs 

  

other income net was 81 million for 2011 compared to 41 million for 2010 primarily related to interest income on higher levels of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

  

the provision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 262 in 2011 and 243 in 2010 the 2011 and 2010 tax rates reflect a reduction in tax expense of 45 million and 207 million respectively relating primarily to reserve adjustments from the favorable settlement of certain tax positions and the completion of prior year audits excluding these adjustments as well as the net impact of acquisition related expenses the loss related to the 2011 sidney flood and the 2011 contingent consideration gain the company’s effective tax rate for 2011 and 2010 was 268 and 274 respectively

cash flow provided by operating activities was 6747 million for 2012 compared to 5652 million for 2011 the increase in cash flow provided by operating activities for 2012 compared to 2011 is primarily due to an increase in net income and a lower increase in components of working capital partially offset by a net increase in other longterm assets cash flow provided by operating activities was 5652 million for 2011 compared to 4249 million for 2010 cash flow provided by operating activities for the 2010 period includes the effect of adoption of financial accounting standards board “fasb” accounting standards update “asu” 200916 “asu 200916” which became effective january 1 2010 and resulted in a decrease to cash flow provided by operating activities of 820 million in 2010 the increase in cash flow provided by operating activities for 2011 compared to 2010 excluding the effect of adoption of asu 200916 in 2010 is primarily due to an increase in net income a lower increase in components of working capital and a decrease in other longterm assets primarily related to deferred income taxes 

  

the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flow increased 89 million in 2012 due primarily to increases in inventory and accounts receivable of 459 million and 1239 million respectively offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of 994 million and 615 million respectively the components of working capital increased 1103 million in 2011 due primarily to increases in inventory accounts receivable and other current assets of 885 million 97 million and 89 million respectively and a decrease of 275 million in accounts payable partially offset by a 243 million increase in accrued liabilities the components of working capital increased 1201 million in 2010 due primarily to increases in accounts receivable inventory and other current assets of 1577 million 652 million and 56 million respectively partially offset by a 769 million increase in accounts payable and a 315 million increase in accrued liabilities

at december 31 2012 and 2011 the company had cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 9425 million and 6489 million respectively the majority of these amounts are located outside of the us the company does not currently intend to repatriate these funds however any repatriation of funds would result in the need to accrue and pay income taxes 

  

in june 2011 the company amended its 10000 million unsecured credit facility the “revolving credit facility” to reduce borrowing costs and to extend the maturity date from august 2014 to july 2016 at december 31 2012 borrowings and availability under the revolving credit facility were 5004 million and 4996 million respectively as of december 31 2012 the interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility was at a spread over libor the revolving credit facility requires payment of certain annual agency and commitment fees and requires that the company satisfy certain financial covenants at december 31 2012 the company was in compliance with the financial covenants under the revolving credit facility 

  

in november 2009 the company issued 6000 million principal amount of unsecured 475 senior notes due november 2014 the “475 senior notes” at 99813 of their face value interest on the 475 senior notes is payable semiannually on may 15 and november 15 of each year to the holders of record as of the immediately preceding may 1 and november 1 the company may at its option redeem some or all of the 475 senior notes at any time by paying a makewhole premium plus accrued and unpaid interest if any to the date of repurchase the 475 senior notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the company’s other unsecured senior indebtedness the fair value of the 475 senior notes at december 31 2012 was approximately 6400 million based on recent bid prices 

  

in january 2012 the company issued 5000 million principal amount of unsecured 400 senior notes due february 2022 the “400 senior notes” at 99746 of their face value net proceeds from the sale of the 400 senior notes were used to repay borrowings under the company’s revolving credit facility interest on the 400 senior notes is payable semiannually on february 1 and august 1 of each year beginning august 1 2012 to the holders of record as of the immediately preceding january 15 and july 15 the company may at its option redeem some or all of the 400 senior notes at any time by paying 100 of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest if any to the date of repurchase plus a makewhole premium if redeemed prior to november 1 2021 the 400 senior notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the company’s other unsecured senior indebtedness the fair value of the 400 senior notes at december 31 2012 was approximately 5330 million based on recent bid prices 

  

a subsidiary of the company has entered into a receivables securitization facility with a financial institution whereby the subsidiary can sell an undivided interest of up to 1000 million in a designated pool of qualified accounts receivable the “receivables securitization facility” the company services administers and collects the receivables on behalf of the purchaser the 

  

  

receivables securitization facility includes certain covenants and provides for various events of termination transfers of receivables are reflected as debt issued in the company’s consolidated statements of cash flow and the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors at december 31 2011 and december 31 2012 is accounted for as a secured borrowing and is included in the company’s consolidated balance sheets as longterm debt at december 31 2012 borrowings under the receivables securitization facility were 1000 million fees incurred in connection with the receivables securitization facility are included in interest expense such fees were approximately 10 million 16 million and 15 million for 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively in january 2013 the company extended the receivables securitization facility to amend the expiration date to january 2014 

  

the carrying value of borrowings under the company’s revolving credit facility and receivables securitization facility approximated their fair value at december 31 2012 due to their relative shortterm maturities and market interest rates 

  

the company had 146 million of issued and unused letters of credit at december 31 2012 

  

the company’s primary ongoing cash requirements will be for operating and capital expenditures product development activities repurchase of its common stock funding of pension obligations dividends and debt service the company may also use cash to fund all or part of the cost of acquisitions the company expects that capital expenditures in 2013 will be approximately 150 to 170 million after declaration by the board of directors the company paid a quarterly dividend on its common stock of 0105 per share in 2012 and 0015 per share in 2011 total dividends declared during 2012 2011 and 2010 were 677 million 101 million and 104 million respectively total dividends paid in 2012 were 701 million including those declared in 2011 and paid in 2012 total dividends paid in 2011 were 103 million including those declared in 2010 and paid in 2011 and total dividends paid in 2010 were 104 million including those declared in 2009 and paid in 2010 the company’s debt service requirements consist primarily of principal and interest on the senior notes the revolving credit facility and the receivables securitization facility 

  

the company’s primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flow the revolving credit facility the receivables securitization facility and cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments the company expects that ongoing cash requirements will be funded from these sources however the company’s sources of liquidity could be adversely affected by among other things a decrease in demand for the company’s products a deterioration in certain of the company’s financial ratios or a deterioration in the quality of the company’s accounts receivable however management believes that the company’s cash cash equivalents and shortterm investment position ability to generate strong cash flow from operations availability under its revolving credit facility and its receivables securitization facility will allow it to meet its obligations for the next twelve months 

  

in january 2011 the company announced that its board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which the company could repurchase up to 20 million shares of its common stock during the three year period ending january 31 2014 the “2011 program” during the twelve months ended december 31 2012 the company repurchased 66 million shares of its common stock under the 2011 program for approximately 3800 million these treasury shares have been retired by the company and common stock and accumulated earnings were reduced accordingly as of december 31 2012 the company had repurchased all shares authorized under the 2011 program 

  

in january 2013 the company announced that its board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which the company may repurchase up to 10 million shares of its common stock during the two year period ending january 31 2015 the “2013 program” the price and timing of any such purchases under the 2013 program will depend on factors such as levels of cash generation from operations the volume of stock option exercises by employees cash requirements for acquisitions economic and market conditions and stock price through february 15 2013 the company has repurchased 07 million shares of its common stock under the 2013 program for 503 million these treasury shares will be retired by the company and common stock and accumulated earnings will be reduced accordingly at february 15 2013 approximately 93 million additional shares of common stock may be repurchased under the 2013 program 

  

environmental matters 

  

subsequent to the acquisition of amphenol from allied signal corporation “allied signal” in 1987 allied signal merged with honeywell international inc in december 1999 “honeywell” the company and honeywell were named jointly and severally liable as potentially responsible parties in connection with several environmental cleanup sites the company and honeywell jointly consented to perform certain investigations and remediation and monitoring activities at the route 8 landfill and the richardson hill road landfill and they were jointly ordered to perform work at the sidney landfill all as referred to above all of the costs incurred relating to these three sites are currently reimbursed by honeywell based on an agreement the “honeywell agreement” entered into in connection with the acquisition in 1987 the environmental investigation remediation and monitoring activities identified by the company including those referred to above are covered under the honeywell agreement management does not believe that the costs associated with resolution of these or any other environmental matters will have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

  

since 1987 the company has not been identified nor has it been named as a potentially responsible party with respect to any other significant onsite or offsite hazardous waste matters in addition the company believes that its manufacturing activities and disposal practices since 1987 have been in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations nonetheless it is possible that the company will be named as a potentially responsible party in the future with respect to additional superfund or other sites although the company is unable to predict with any reasonable certainty the extent of its ultimate liability with respect to any pending or future environmental matters the company believes based upon information currently known by management about the company’s manufacturing activities disposal practices and estimates of liability with respect to known environmental matters that any such liability will not have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

inflation and costs 

  

the cost of the company’s products is influenced by the cost of a wide variety of raw materials including precious metals such as gold and silver used in plating aluminum copper brass and steel used for contacts shells and cable and plastic materials used in molding connector bodies inserts and cable the company strives to offset the impact of increases in the cost of raw materials labor and services through price increases productivity improvements and cost saving programs however in certain markets particularly in the communications related markets this can be difficult and there is no guarantee that the company will be successful 

  

foreign exchange 

  

the company conducts business in many international currencies through its worldwide operations and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the company’s sales gross margins and equity the company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk in a number of ways including producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency cost reduction and pricing actions and working capital management however there can be no assurance that these actions will be fully effective in managing currency risk especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the company’s worldwide operations 

  

recent accounting pronouncements 

  

in february 2013 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued asu 201302 reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income “asu 201302” the update requires disclosure of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in addition an entity is required to present either on the face of the consolidated statements of income or in the notes significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income but only if the amount reclassified is required to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period for amounts not reclassified in their entirety to net income an entity is required to crossreference to other disclosures that provide additional detail about those amounts asu 201302 is effective prospectively for the company for annual and interim periods beginning january 1 2013 the company does not expect that the adoption of this update will have a material effect on its financial statements 

  

in september 2011 the fasb issued asu 201108 intangibles  goodwill and other testing for goodwill impairment “asu 201108” which allows an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test under this amendment an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines based on a qualitative assessment of events and circumstances that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount asu 201108 was effective for the company as of january 1 2012 the company utilized the option to assess qualitative factors pursuant to this update when performing its 2012 annual impairment assessment the adoption of this update did not have a material effect on the company’s financial statements 

  

in may 2011 the fasb issued asu 201104 fair value measurement amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss “asu 201104” asu 201104 improves comparability of fair value measurements presented and disclosed in financial statements prepared with us generally accepted accounting principles and international financial reporting standards asu 201104 clarifies the application of existing fair value measurement requirements including 1 the application of the highest and best use and valuation premise concepts 2 measuring the fair value of an instrument classified in a reporting entity’s shareholders’ equity and 3 quantitative information required for fair value measurements categorized within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy asu 201104 also provides guidance on measuring the fair value of financial instruments managed within a portfolio and application of premiums and discounts in a fair value measurement in addition asu 201104 requires additional disclosure for level 3 measurements regarding the sensitivity of fair value to changes in unobservable inputs and any interrelationships between those inputs the amendments in this guidance are to be applied prospectively and were 

  

  

effective for the company beginning january 1 2012 the adoption of this update did not have a material effect on the company’s financial statements 

  

pensions 

  

the company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries have two defined benefit pension plans “us plans” which cover certain us employees and which represent the majority of the plan assets and benefit obligations of the aggregate defined benefit plans of the company the us plans’ benefits are generally based on years of service and compensation and are generally noncontributory certain us employees not covered by the us plans are covered by defined contribution plans certain foreign subsidiaries also have defined benefit plans covering their employees the “international plans” the pension expense for the us plans and international plans the “plans” approximated 252 million 191 million and 180 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively and is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions established on january 1 of the applicable year including a weightedaverage discount rate rate increase of future compensation levels and an expected longterm rate of return on the respective plans’ assets 

  

the discount rate used by the company for valuing pension liabilities is based on a review of high quality corporate bond yields with maturities approximating the remaining life of the projected benefit obligations the discount rate for the us plans on this basis was 375 at december 31 2012 and 445 at december 31 2011 although future changes to the discount rate are unknown had the discount rate increased or decreased 50 basis points the accrued benefit obligation would have decreased or increased by approximately 230 million 

  

in developing the expected longterm rate of return assumption for the us plans the company evaluated input from its external actuaries and investment consultants as well as longterm inflation assumptions projected returns by such consultants are based on broad equity and bond indices the company also considered its historical twentyyear compounded return of approximately 9 which has been in excess of these broad equity and bond benchmark indices as described above the expected longterm rate of return on the us plans’ assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of 60 with equity managers with an expected longterm rate of return of approximately 9 and 40 with fixed income managers with an expected longterm rate of return of approximately 7 as of december 31 2012 and 2011 the asset allocation was 62 with equity managers and 37 with fixed income managers and 1 in cash the company believes that the longterm asset allocation on average will approximate 60 with equity managers and 40 with fixed income managers the company regularly reviews the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances investments to its targeted allocation when considered appropriate based on this methodology the company’s expected longterm rate of return assumption to determine the accrued benefit obligation of the us plans at december 31 2012 and 2011 is approximately 800 and 825 respectively 

  

the company made cash contributions to the plans of 218 million 228 million and 173 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively the total liability for accrued pension and postemployment benefit obligations under the company’s pension and postretirement benefit plans increased in 2012 to 2466 million 37 million of which is included in other accrued expenses representing required contributions to be made during 2013 for unfunded foreign plans from 2103 million in 2011 primarily due to a reduction of the discount rate assumption compared to 2011 the company estimates that based on current actuarial calculations it will make a cash contribution to the plans in 2013 of approximately 210 million most of which is related to the us plans cash contributions in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors including the investment performance of the respective plans’ assets 

  

the company offers various defined contribution plans for us and foreign employees participation in these plans is based on certain eligibility requirements the company matches the majority of employee contributions to the us defined contribution plans with cash contributions up to a maximum of 5 of eligible compensation the company provided matching contributions of approximately 27 million 25 million and 22 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

  

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates estimates are adjusted as new information becomes available the company’s critical accounting policies and estimates are set forth below 

  

revenue recognition  the company’s primary source of revenues is from product sales to its customers revenue from sales of the company’s products is recognized at the time the goods are delivered and title passes provided the earning process is complete and revenue is measurable delivery is determined by the company’s shipping terms which are primarily freight on board shipping point revenue is recorded at the net amount to be received after deductions for estimated discounts allowances and returns these estimates and reserves are determined and adjusted as needed based upon historical experience contract terms and other related factors the shipping costs for the majority of the company’s sales are paid directly by the company’s customers in the broadband communications market approximately 8 of consolidated sales in 2012 the company pays for shipping costs to the majority of its customers shipping costs are also paid by the company for certain customers in the interconnect products and assemblies segment amounts billed to customers related to shipping costs are immaterial and are included in net sales shipping costs incurred to transport products to the customer which are not reimbursed are included in selling general and administrative expense 

  

inventories  inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost which approximates average cost or market provisions for slowmoving and obsolete inventory are made based on historical experience and product demand should future product demand change existing inventory could become slowmoving or obsolete and provisions would be increased accordingly 

  

depreciable assets  property plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation the appropriateness and the recoverability of the carrying value of such assets are periodically reviewed taking into consideration current and expected business conditions the company has not recorded any significant impairments 

  

goodwill  the company performs its annual evaluation for the impairment of goodwill for the company’s reporting units as of each june 30 the company has defined its reporting units as the two reportable business segments “interconnect products and assemblies” and “cable products” as the components of these reportable business segments have similar economic characteristics in 2012 the company utilized the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test in accordance with asu 201108 intangibles – goodwill and other testing for goodwill impairment “asu 201108” which was adopted by the company as of january 1 2012 under this amendment an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the company determines based on a qualitative assessment of events and circumstances that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount 

  

as of june 30 2012 and for each previous year in which the impairment test has been performed the estimated fair value of the company’s reporting units significantly exceeded their carrying values and therefore the company has not recognized any goodwill impairment in 2012 2011 or 2010 in connection with its annual impairment test 

  

defined benefit plan obligation  the defined benefit plan obligation is based on significant assumptions such as mortality rates discount rates and plan asset rates of return as determined by the company in consultation with the respective benefit plan actuaries and investment advisors note 9 

  

income taxes  deferred income taxes are provided for revenue and expenses which are recognized in different periods for income tax and financial statement reporting purposes at december 31 2012 the cumulative amount of undistributed earnings of foreign affiliated companies was approximately 22 billion deferred income taxes are not provided on undistributed earnings of foreign affiliated companies as it is the company’s intention to reinvest these earnings permanently outside the us it is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if undistributed earnings were to be repatriated as there is a significant amount of uncertainty with respect to the tax impact of the remittance of these earnings due to the fact that dividends received from foreign subsidiaries may generate additional foreign tax credits which could ultimately reduce the us tax cost of the dividend these uncertainties are further complicated by the significant number of foreign tax jurisdictions involved deferred tax assets are regularly assessed for recoverability based on both historical and anticipated earnings levels and a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that these amounts will not be recovered the tax effects of an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns are recognized only if it is “more likely than not” to be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on its technical merits as of the reporting date the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement the company includes estimated interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes 

  

the significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 to the company’s consolidated financial statements 

  

  

disclosures about contractual obligations and commitments 

  

the following table summarizes the company’s known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of december 31 2012 as well as an estimate of the timing in which such obligations are expected to be satisfied 

  

 

  

1   the company has excluded expected interest payments on the revolving credit facility and the receivables securitization facility from the above table as this calculation is largely dependent on average debt levels the company expects to have during each of the years presented the actual interest payments made related to the revolving credit facility and receivables securitization facility in 2012 were 83 million expected debt levels and therefore expected interest payments are difficult to predict as they are significantly impacted by such items as future acquisitions repurchases of treasury stock dividend payments as well as payments or additional borrowing made to reduce or increase the underlying revolver balance 

  

2   included in this table are estimated benefit payments expected to be made under the company’s unfunded pension and postretirement benefit plans the company also maintains several funded pension and postretirement benefit plans the most significant of which covers its us employees over the past several years there has been no minimum requirement for company contributions to the us plans due to prior contributions made in excess of minimum requirements however the company did make a voluntary contribution of approximately 185 million in 2012 an anticipated minimum required contribution of approximately 92 million was included in the above table related to the us plans for 2013 it is not possible to reasonably estimate expected required contributions in the above table after 2013 since several assumptions are required to calculate minimum required contributions such as the discount rate and expected returns on pension assets 

  

3   as of december 31 2012 the company has noncurrent liabilities of approximately 162 million recognized in accordance with the income taxes topic of the accounting standards codification these liabilities have been excluded from the above table due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows it is difficult to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid

certain operations of the company are subject to environmental laws and regulations which govern the discharge of pollutants into the air and water as well as the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes the company believes that its operations are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that the costs of continuing compliance will not have a material effect on the company’s financial condition or results of operations 

  

  

owners and occupiers of sites containing hazardous substances as well as generators of hazardous substances are subject to broad liability under various environmental laws and regulations including expenditures for cleanup and monitoring costs and potential damages arising out of past disposal activities such liability in many cases may be imposed regardless of fault or the legality of the original disposal activity the company has performed remediation activities and is currently performing operations and maintenance and monitoring activities at three offsite disposal sites previously utilized by the company’s facility in sidney new york and others  the richardson hill road landfill the route 8 landfill and the sidney landfill actions at the richardson hill road and sidney landfills were undertaken subsequent to designation as “superfund” sites on the national priorities list under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 the route 8 landfill was designated as a new york state inactive hazardous waste disposal site with remedial actions taken pursuant to chapter 6 section 3751 of the new york code of rules and regulations in addition the company is currently performing monitoring activities at and in proximity to its manufacturing site in sidney new york the company is also engaged in remediating or monitoring environmental conditions at certain of its other manufacturing facilities and has been named as a potentially responsible party for cleanup costs at other offsite disposal sites 

  

subsequent to the acquisition of amphenol from allied signal corporation “allied signal” in 1987 allied signal merged with honeywell international inc in december 1999 “honeywell” the company and honeywell were named jointly and severally liable as potentially responsible parties in connection with several environmental cleanup sites the company and honeywell jointly consented to perform certain investigations and remediation and monitoring activities at the route 8 landfill and the richardson hill road landfill and they were jointly ordered to perform work at the sidney landfill all as referred to above all of the costs incurred relating to these three sites are currently reimbursed by honeywell based on an agreement the “honeywell agreement” entered into in connection with the acquisition in 1987 management does not believe that the costs associated with resolution of these or any other environmental matters will have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations the environmental investigation remediation and monitoring activities identified by the company including those referred to above are covered under the honeywell agreement 

  

since 1987 the company has not been identified nor has it been named as a potentially responsible party with respect to any other significant onsite or offsite hazardous waste matters in addition the company believes that its manufacturing activities and disposal practices since 1987 have been in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations nonetheless it is possible that the company will be named as a potentially responsible party in the future with respect to additional superfund or other sites although the company is unable to predict with any reasonable certainty the extent of its ultimate liability with respect to any pending or future environmental matters the company believes based upon information currently known by management about the company’s manufacturing activities disposal practices and estimates of liability with respect to known environmental matters that any such liability will not have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations

if actions taken by management to limit monitor or control financial enterprise risk exposures are not successful the company’s business and consolidated financial statements could be materially adversely affected in such case the trading price of the company’s common stock could decline and investors may lose all or part of their investment 

  

the company is dependent on the communications industry including telecommunications and data communications wireless communications and broadband communications 

  

approximately 59 of the company’s 2011 revenues came from sales to the communications industry including telecommunication and data communication wireless communications and broadband communications of which 20 of the company’s sales came from sales to the wireless device market demand for these products is subject to rapid technological change see below—“the company is dependent on the acceptance of new product introductions for continued revenue growth” these markets are dominated by several large manufacturers and operators who regularly exert significant price pressure on their suppliers including the company there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to compete successfully in the communications industry and the company’s failure to do so could have an adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

  

approximately 7 and 12 of the company’s 2011 revenues came from sales to the broadband communications and wireless infrastructure markets respectively demand for the company’s products in these markets depends primarily on capital spending by operators for constructing rebuilding or upgrading their systems the amount of this capital spending and therefore the company’s sales and profitability will be affected by a variety of factors including general economic conditions consolidation within the communications industry the financial condition of operators and their access to financing competition technological developments new legislation and regulation of operators there can be no assurance that existing levels of capital spending will continue or that spending will not decrease 

  

changes in defense expenditures may reduce the company’s sales 

  

approximately 15 of the company’s 2011 revenues came from sales to the military market the company participates in a broad spectrum of defense programs and believes that no one program accounted for more than 1 of its 2011 revenues the substantial majority of these sales are related to both us and foreign military and defense programs the company’s sales are generally to contractors and subcontractors of the us or foreign governments or to distributors that in turn sell to the contractors and subcontractors accordingly the company’s sales are affected by changes in the defense budgets of the us and foreign governments a significant decline in us defense expenditures and foreign government defense expenditures generally could adversely affect the company’s business and have an adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

  

the company encounters competition in substantially all areas of its business 

  

the company competes primarily on the basis of technology innovation product quality price customer service and delivery time competitors include large diversified companies some of which have substantially greater assets and financial resources than the company as well as medium to small companies there can be no assurance that additional competitors will not enter the company’s existing markets nor can there be any assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against existing or new competition and the inability to do so could have an adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

  

the company is dependent on the acceptance of new product introductions for continued revenue growth 

  

the company estimates that products introduced in the last two years accounted for approximately 24 of 2011 net sales the company’s longterm results of operations depend substantially upon its ability to continue to conceive design source and market new products and upon continuing market acceptance of its existing and future product lines in the ordinary course of business the company continually develops or creates new product line concepts if the company fails to or is significantly delayed in introducing new product line concepts or if the company’s new products do not meet with market acceptance its business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

  

  

covenants in the company’s credit agreements may adversely affect the company 

  

the credit agreement amended on june 30 2011 among the company certain subsidiaries of the company and a syndicate of financial institutions the “revolving credit facility” contains financial and other covenants such as a limit on the ratio of debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization a limit on priority indebtedness and limits on incurrence of liens although the company believes none of these covenants is presently restrictive to the company’s operations the ability to meet the financial covenants can be affected by events beyond the company’s control and the company cannot provide assurance that it will meet those tests a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the revolving credit facility upon the occurrence of an event of default under any of the company’s credit facilities the lenders could elect to declare amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit if the lenders accelerate the repayment of borrowings the company may not have sufficient assets to repay the revolving credit facility and other indebtedness 

  

downgrades of the company’s debt rating could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

  

if the credit rating agencies that rate the company’s debt were to downgrade the company’s credit rating in conjunction with a deterioration of the company’s performance it may increase the company’s cost of capital and make it more difficult for the company to obtain new financing which could adversely affect the company’s business 

  

the company’s results may be negatively affected by changing interest rates  

  

the company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on the company’s financing activities as of december 31 2011 7778 million or 56 of the company’s outstanding borrowings were subject to floating interest rates primarily libor the company has 6000 million of unsecured senior notes due november 2014 outstanding which were issued at 99813 of their face value and which have a fixed interest rate of 475 the “475 senior notes” in addition in january 2012 the company issued 5000 million of unsecured senior notes due february 2022 at 99746 of their face value and which have a fixed interest rate of 400 the “400 senior notes” the net proceeds from the sale of the 400 senior notes were used to repay borrowings under the company’s revolving credit facility 

  

a 10 change in libor at december 31 2011would have no material effect on the company’s interest expense the company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2012 although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly change 

  

the company’s results may be negatively affected by foreign currency exchange rates 

  

the company conducts business in several international currencies through its worldwide operations and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the company’s sales gross margins and equity the company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk in a number of ways including producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency cost reduction and pricing actions and working capital management however there can be no assurance that these actions will be fully effective in managing currency risk especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the company’s worldwide operations which could have an adverse effect on the company’s results of operations and financial conditions 

  

the company is subject to the risks of political economic and military instability in countries outside the united states 

  

nonus markets account for a substantial portion of the company’s business during 2011 nonus markets constituted approximately 68 of the company’s net sales the company employs more than 89 of its workforce outside the united states the company’s customers are located throughout the world and it has many manufacturing administrative and sales facilities outside the united states because the company has extensive nonus operations as well as the amount of cash and cash investments that are held at institutions located outside of the us it is exposed to risks that could negatively affect sales profitability or the liquidity of such cash and cash investments including 

  

·   tariffs trade barriers and trade disputes 

·   regulations related to customs and importexport matters

the company may experience difficulties and unanticipated expense of assimilating newly acquired businesses including the potential for the impairment of goodwill 

  

the company has completed a number of acquisitions in the past few years and anticipates that it will continue to pursue acquisition opportunities as part of its growth strategy the company may experience difficulty and unanticipated expense in integrating such acquisitions and the acquisitions may not perform as expected at december 31 2011 the total assets of the company were 44452 million which included 17461 million of goodwill the excess of fair value of consideration paid over the fair value of net identifiable assets of businesses acquired the company performs annual evaluations for the potential impairment of the carrying value of goodwill such evaluations have not resulted in the need to recognize an impairment however if the financial performance of the company’s businesses were to decline significantly the company could incur a material noncash charge to its income statement for the impairment of goodwill 

  

the company may experience difficulties in obtaining a consistent supply of materials at stable pricing levels which could adversely affect its results of operations 

  

the company uses basic materials like steel aluminum brass copper bimetallic products silver gold and plastic resins in its manufacturing processes volatility in the prices of such material and availability of supply may have a substantial impact on the price the company pays for such materials in addition to the extent such cost increases cannot be recovered through sales price increases or productivity improvements the company’s margin may decline 

  

the company may not be able to attract and retain key employees 

  

the company’s continued success depends upon its continued ability to hire and retain key employees at its operations around the world any difficulties in obtaining or retaining the management and other human resource competencies that the company needs to achieve its business objectives may have an adverse effect on the company’s performance

2011 compared to 2010 

  

net sales were 39398 million for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to 35541 million for 2010 an increase of 11 in us dollars 9 in local currencies and 6 organically excluding both currency and acquisition impacts sales of interconnect products and assemblies in 2011 approximately 93 of net sales increased 11 in us dollars 10 in local currencies and 7 organically compared to 2010 36660 million in 2011 versus 32931 million in 2010 driven by strength in the wireless devices automotive industrial and commercial aerospace markets sales to the wireless devices market increased approximately 1954 million primarily due to increased smart wireless device and tablet computer demand sales to the automotive market increased approximately 1010 million driven primarily by new electronics applications as well as from the impact of two acquisitions made during the year industrial market sales increased approximately 713 million primarily reflecting increased sales to alternative energy oil and gas and heavy equipment markets sales to the commercial aerospace market increased approximately 360 million primarily due to higher airplane production volumes as well as next generation jet liner production this was partially offset by reductions in sales to the military aerospace market approximately 95 million primarily due to reductions in procurement by defense contractors related to budget uncertainties and also due to the approximately 180 million business interruption impact from the flood at the company’s sidney new york facility in early september 2011 as further described below the “flood impact” partially offset by acquisition growth from a 2010 acquisition and a reduction in sales to the wireless infrastructure market approximately 217 million primarily due to slowed demand at base stationequipment manufacturers sales of cable products in 2011 approximately 7 of net sales increased 5 in us dollars and 3 in local currencies compared to 2010 2737 million in 2011 versus 2610 million in 2010 primarily due to increased spending in south american wireless infrastructure markets during the year partially offset by lower spending in broadband communications markets 

  

geographically sales in the us in 2011 increased approximately 1 12689 million in 2011 versus 12582 million in 2010 compared to 2010 international sales for 2011 increased approximately 16 in us dollars and 14 in local currencies 26709 million in 2011 versus 22960 million in 2010 compared to 2010 with particular strength in asia the comparatively weaker us dollar in 2011 had the effect of increasing net sales by approximately 596 million when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2010 

  

the gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was 316 in 2011 compared to 326 in 2010 the operating margin for the interconnect products and assemblies segment decreased approximately 05 compared to the prior year as a result of the impacts of increases in input costs primarily due to higher commodity prices these impacts were partially offset by the positive impacts of higher volume cost reduction actions and price increases the operating margins for the cable products segment decreased 09 primarily as a result of higher relative material costs 

  

the company incurred damage at its sidney new york manufacturing facility as a result of severe and sudden flooding in new york state in early september 2011 as separately presented in the consolidated statements of income the company recorded a charge of 215 million 135 million after taxes for propertyrelated damage as well as cleanup and repair efforts incurred through december 31 2011 net of insurance recoveries this charge includes the company’s loss for damaged inventory and machinery and equipment the sidney facility had limited manufacturing and sales activity primarily during the third quarter of 2011 but the plant was substantially back to full production by the end of the fourth quarter of 2011 

  

during the year ended december 31 2011 the company reassessed based on current 2011 performance expectations a contingent acquisitionrelated obligation which would have been payable in 2012 related to a 2010 acquisition note 3 performance expectations were reduced as a result of a softening in demand in the defense market and the related deferral of certain defense related programs to periods beyond 2011 and therefore outside the contractual earnout period therefore it was determined that the payment related to 2011 profitability levels was no longer probable and the company adjusted the remaining contingent consideration liability of 178 million as a gain in operating income as separately presented in the consolidated statements of income based on the actual 2011 results of the acquired company it has been determined that the 2012 contingent consideration payment is in fact not payable this adjustment had an impact of 112 million on net income or 006 per share for the year ended december 31 2011

interest expense was 430 million for 2011 compared to 407 million for 2010 the increase is primarily attributed to higher average debt levels related to the company’s stock repurchase program note 7 partially offset by lower average borrowing costs 

  

other income net was 81 million for 2011 compared to 41 million for 2010 primarily related to interest income on higher levels of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

  

the provision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 262 in 2011 and 243 in 2010 the 2011 and 2010 tax rates reflect a reduction in tax expense of 45 million and 207 million respectively relating primarily to reserve adjustments from the favorable settlement of certain tax positions and the completion of prior year audits excluding these adjustments the company’s effective tax rate for 2011 and 2010 was 268 and 274 respectively

the gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was 326 in 2010 compared to 314 in 2009 the operating margin for interconnect products and assemblies increased approximately 23 compared to the prior year primarily as a result of higher volume levels combined with the proactive and aggressive management of all elements of costs cable operating margins decreased 17 primarily as a result of higher relative material costs and the impact of market price reductions 

  

selling general and administrative expenses were 4579 million and 3976 million in 2010 and 2009 or approximately 13 and 14 of net sales for 2010 and 2009 respectively the increase in expense in 2010 is primarily attributable to increases in the major components of selling general and administrative expenses selling and marketing expenses increased approximately 171 million in 2010 due primarily to the higher sales volume and the impact on related costs such as freight and employee costs research and development expenditures increased approximately 136 million reflecting increases in expenditures for new product development and represented approximately 2 of sales for both 2010 and 2009 administrative expenses increased approximately 296 million primarily related to an increase in stockbased compensation expense amortization of identified intangible assets and employee incentive payments and represented approximately 5 of sales for both 2010 and 2009 

  

interest expense was 407 million for 2010 compared to 366 million for 2009 the increase is primarily attributable to the inclusion of fees of 15 million in 2010 on the company’s receivables securitization facility in interest expense included in other expense net in 2009 in accordance with the adoption of the financial accounting standards board “fasb” accounting standards update “asu” no 200916 accounting for transfers of financial assets “asu 200916” which was effective january 1 2010 note 2 and is also attributable to onetime expenses of 05 million for the early extinguishment of the company’s previous credit facility and a full year of deferred debt issue costs in the 2010 related to the senior notes issuance in november 2009 

  

the provision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 243 in 2010 and 267 in 2009 the 2010 tax rate reflects a reduction in tax expense of 207 million relating primarily to reserve adjustments from the favorable settlement of certain international tax positions and the completion of prior year audits the 2009 tax rate reflects a reduction in tax expense of 36 million for tax reserve adjustments relating to the completion of the audit of certain of the company’s prior year tax returns excluding these adjustments the company’s effective tax rate for 2010 and 2009 was 274 and 275 respectively

in january 2011 the company announced that its board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which the company may repurchase up to 20 million shares of its common stock during the three year period ending january 31 2014 the “program” during the twelve months ended december 31 2011 the company repurchased 134 million shares of its common stock for approximately 6722 million these treasury shares have been or will be retired by the company and common stock and accumulated earnings were reduced accordingly the price and timing of any such purchases under the program after december 31 2011 will depend on factors such as levels of cash generation from operations the volume of stock option exercises by employees cash requirements for acquisitions economic and market conditions and stock price as of december 31 2011 66 million shares of common stock may be repurchased under the program through february 17 2012 the company has repurchased an additional 11 million shares of its common stock for 602 million at february 17 2012 approximately 55 million additional shares of common stock may be repurchased under the program 

  

environmental matters 

  

subsequent to the acquisition of amphenol from allied signal corporation “allied signal” in 1987 allied signal merged with honeywell international inc in december 1999 “honeywell” the company and honeywell were named jointly and severally liable as potentially responsible parties in connection with several environmental cleanup sites the company and honeywell jointly consented to perform certain investigations and remediation and monitoring activities at two sites the “route 8” landfill and the “richardson hill road” landfill and they were jointly ordered to perform work at another site the “sidney” landfill all of the costs incurred relating to these three sites are currently reimbursed by honeywell based on an agreement the “honeywell agreement” entered into in connection with the acquisition in 1987 management does not believe that the costs associated with resolution of these or any other environmental matters will have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations the environmental investigations remediation and monitoring activities identified by the company including those referred to above are covered under the honeywell agreement 

  

inflation and costs 

  

the cost of the company’s products is influenced by the cost of a wide variety of raw materials including precious metals such as gold and silver used in plating aluminum copper brass and steel used for contacts shells and cable and plastic materials used in molding connector bodies inserts and cable the company strives to offset the impact of increases in the cost of raw materials labor and services through price increases productivity improvements and cost saving programs however in certain markets particularly in the communications related markets this can be difficult and there is no guarantee that the company will be successful 

  

foreign exchange 

  

the company conducts business in several international currencies through its worldwide operations and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the company’s sales gross margins and equity the company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk in a number of ways including producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency cost reduction and pricing actions and working capital management however there can be no assurance that these actions will be fully effective in managing currency risk especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the company’s worldwide operations 

  

  

new accounting pronouncements 

  

in september 2011 the fasb issued accounting standards update “asu” 201108 intangibles  goodwill and other “asu 201108” which allows an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test under this amendment an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines based on a qualitative assessment of events and circumstances that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount asu 201108 is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2011 the company will consider this update when performing its annual impairment assessment in the third quarter of 2012 

  

in june 2011 the fasb issued asu no 201105 presentation of comprehensive income “asu 201105” asu 201105 requires companies to present the components of net income and other comprehensive income either as one continuous statement or as two consecutive statements it eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders’ equity asu 201105 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2011 and is applied retrospectively the company has adopted this update and presented the consolidated statements of comprehensive income immediately following the consolidated statements of income 

  

in may 2011 the fasb issued asu no 201104 fair value measurement amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss “asu 201104” asu 201104 improves comparability of fair value measurements presented and disclosed in financial statements prepared with us generally accepted accounting principles and international financial reporting standards asu 201104 clarifies the application of existing fair value measurement requirements including 1 the application of the highest and best use and valuation premise concepts 2 measuring the fair value of an instrument classified in a reporting entity’s shareholders’ equity and 3 quantitative information required for fair value measurements categorized within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy asu 201104 also provides guidance on measuring the fair value of financial instruments managed within a portfolio and application of premiums and discounts in a fair value measurement in addition asu 201104 requires additional disclosure for level 3 measurements regarding the sensitivity of fair value to changes in unobservable inputs and any interrelationships between those inputs the amendments in this guidance are to be applied prospectively and are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2011 the company does not expect that the adoption of this update will have a material effect on its financial statements 

  

pensions 

  

the company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries have two defined benefit pension plans “us plans” which cover certain us employees and which represent the majority of the plan assets and benefit obligations of the aggregate defined benefit plans of the company the us plans’ benefits are generally based on years of service and compensation and are generally noncontributory certain us employees not covered by the us plans are covered by defined contribution plans certain foreign subsidiaries also have defined benefit plans covering their employees the “international plans” the pension expense for the us plans and international plans the “plans” approximated 191 million 180 million and 165 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively and is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions established on january 1 of the applicable year including a weightedaverage discount rate rate increase of future compensation levels and an expected longterm rate of return on the respective plans’ assets 

  

the discount rate used by the company for valuing pension liabilities is based on a review of high quality corporate bond yields with maturities approximating the remaining life of the projected benefit obligations the discount rate for the us plans on this basis was 445 at december 31 2011 and 520 at december 31 2010 although future changes to the discount rate are unknown had the discount rate increased or decreased 50 basis points the accrued benefit obligation would have decreased or increased by approximately 210 million 

  

in developing the expected longterm rate of return assumption for the us plans the company evaluated input from its external actuaries and investment consultants as well as longterm inflation assumptions projected returns by such consultants are based on broad equity and bond indices the company also considered its historical twentyyear compounded return of approximately 9 which has been in excess of these broad equity and bond benchmark indices the expected longterm rate of return on the us plans’ assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of 60 with equity managers with an expected longterm rate of return of approximately 9 and 40 with fixed income managers with an expected longterm rate of return of approximately 7 as of december 31 2011 the asset allocation was 62 with equity managers and 37 with fixed income managers and 1 in cash as of december 31 2010 the asset allocation was 59 with equity managers and 36 with fixed income managers and 5 in cash the company believes that the longterm asset allocation on average will approximate 60 with equity managers and 40 with fixed income managers the company regularly reviews the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances investments to its targeted 

  

  

allocation when considered appropriate based on this methodology the company’s expected longterm rate of return assumption to determine the accrued benefit obligation of the us plans at both december 31 2011 and 2010 is approximately 825 respectively 

  

the company made cash contributions to the plans of 228 million and 173 million in 2011 and 2010 respectively the total liability for accrued pension and postemployment benefit obligations under the company’s pension and postretirement benefit plans increased in 2011 to 2103 million 32 million of which is included in other accrued expenses representing required contributions to be made during 2012 for unfunded foreign plans from 1799 million in 2010 primarily due to a reduction of the discount rate assumption compared to 2010 the company estimates that based on current actuarial calculations it will make a cash contribution to the plans in 2012 of approximately 260 million most of which is related to the us plans cash contributions in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors including the investment performance of the respective plans’ assets 

  

the company offers various defined contribution plans for us and foreign employees participation in these plans is based on certain eligibility requirements the company matches the majority of employee contributions to the us defined contribution plans with cash contributions up to a maximum of 5 of eligible compensation the company provided matching contributions of approximately 25 million and 22 million in 2011 and 2010 respectively 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates estimates are adjusted as new information becomes available the company’s significant accounting policies are set forth below 

  

revenue recognition  the company’s primary source of revenues is from product sales to its customers revenue from sales of the company’s products is recognized at the time the goods are delivered and title passes provided the earning process is complete and revenue is measurable delivery is determined by the company’s shipping terms which are primarily freight on board shipping point revenue is recorded at the net amount to be received after deductions for estimated discounts allowances and returns these estimates and reserves are determined and adjusted as needed based upon historical experience contract terms and other related factors the shipping costs for the majority of the company’s sales are paid directly by the company’s customers in the broadband communications market approximately 7 of consolidated sales in 2011 the company pays for shipping cost to the majority of its customers shipping costs are also paid by the company for certain customers in the interconnect products and assemblies segment amounts billed to customers related to shipping costs are immaterial and are included in net sales shipping costs incurred to transport products to the customer which are not reimbursed are included in selling general and administrative expense 

  

inventories  inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost which approximates average cost or market provisions for slowmoving and obsolete inventory are made based on historical experience and product demand should future product demand change existing inventory could become slowmoving or obsolete and provisions would be increased accordingly 

  

depreciable assets  property plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation the appropriateness and the recoverability of the carrying value of such assets are periodically reviewed taking into consideration current and expected business conditions the company has not recorded any significant impairments 

  

goodwill  the company performs its annual evaluation for the impairment of goodwill for the company’s reporting units as of each june 30 the company has determined that its reporting units are its two reportable business segments “interconnect products and assemblies” and “cable products” as the components of these reportable business segments have similar economic characteristics goodwill impairment for each reporting unit is evaluated using a twostep approach requiring the company to determine the fair value of the reporting unit and to compare that to the carrying value of the reporting unit if the carrying value exceeded the fair value the goodwill of the reporting unit would be potentially impaired and a second step of testing would be performed to measure the impairment loss the second step of the goodwill impairment test would require the comparison of the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill to the carrying amount of that goodwill if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds its fair value an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the excess the second step of the goodwill impairment test was not required 

  

as of june 30 2011 and for each previous year in which the impairment test has been performed the estimated fair value of the company’s reporting units exceeded their carrying values and therefore no impairment was recognized 

  

  

defined benefit plan obligation  the defined benefit plan obligation is based on significant assumptions such as mortality rates discount rates and plan asset rates of return as determined by the company in consultation with the respective benefit plan actuaries and investment advisors 

  

income taxes  deferred income taxes are provided for revenue and expenses which are recognized in different periods for income tax and financial statement reporting purposes at december 31 2011 the cumulative amount of undistributed earnings of foreign affiliated companies was approximately 21 billion deferred income taxes are not provided on undistributed earnings of foreign affiliated companies which are considered to be permanently invested it is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if undistributed earnings were to be repatriated as there is a significant amount of uncertainty with respect to the tax impact of the remittance of these earnings due to the fact that dividends received from foreign subsidiaries could bring additional foreign tax credits which could ultimately reduce the us tax cost of the dividend these uncertainties are further complicated by the significant number of foreign tax jurisdictions involved deferred tax assets are regularly assessed for recoverability based on both historical and anticipated earnings levels and a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that these amounts will not be recovered the tax effects of an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns are recognized only if it is “more likely than not” to be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on its technical merits as of the reporting date the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement the company includes estimated interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes 

  

the significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 to the company’s consolidated financial statements 

  

  

disclosures about contractual obligations and commitments 

  

the following table summarizes the company’s known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of december 31 2011 as well as an estimate of the timing in which such obligations are expected to be satisfied 

  

 

  

1   the company has excluded expected interest payments on the revolving credit facility and the receivables securitization facility from the above table as this calculation is largely dependent on average debt levels the company expects to have during each of the years presented the actual interest payments made related to the revolving credit facility and receivables securitization facility in 2011 were 137 million including amortization of the fees related to the amendment of the revolving credit facility expected debt levels and therefore expected interest payments are difficult to predict as they are significantly impacted by such items as future acquisitions repurchases of treasury stock dividend payments as well as payments or additional borrowing made to reduce or increase the underlying revolver balance 

  

2   included in this table are estimated benefit payments expected to be made under the company’s unfunded pension and postretirement benefit plans the company also maintains several funded pension and postretirement benefit plans the most significant of which covers its us employees over the past several years there has been no minimum requirement for company contributions to the us plans due to prior contributions made in excess of minimum requirements however the company did make a voluntary contribution of approximately 200 million in 2011 an anticipated minimum required contribution of approximately 212 million was included in the above table related to the us plans for 2012 it is not possible to reasonably estimate expected required contributions in the above table after 2012 since several assumptions are required to calculate minimum required contributions such as the discount rate and expected returns on pension assets 

  

3   as of december 31 2011 the company has noncurrent liabilities of approximately 219 million recognized in accordance with the income taxes topic of the accounting standards codification these liabilities have been excluded from the above table due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows it is difficult to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid 

  

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

the company in the normal course of doing business is exposed to a variety of risks including market risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates

approximately 60 of the company’s 2010 revenues came from sales to the communications industry including telecommunication and data communication wireless communications and broadband communications demand for these products is subject to rapid technological change see below—“the company is dependent on the acceptance of new product introductions for continued revenue growth” these markets are dominated by several large manufacturers and operators who regularly exert significant price pressure on their suppliers including the company the loss of one or more of the large communications customers could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to compete successfully in the communications industry and the company’s failure to do so could have an adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

  

approximately 8 of the company’s 2010 revenues came from sales to the broadband communications industry demand for the company’s broadband communications products depends primarily on capital spending by cable television operators for constructing rebuilding or upgrading their systems the amount of this capital spending and therefore the company’s sales and profitability will be affected by a variety of factors including general economic conditions acquisitions of cable television operators by noncable television operators cable system consolidation within the industry the financial condition of domestic cable television operators and their access to financing competition from satellite telephone and television providers and telephone companies technological developments and new legislation and regulation of cable television operators there can be no assurance that existing levels of cable television capital spending will continue or that cable television spending will not decrease

the company is dependent on the acceptance of new product introductions for continued revenue growth 

  

the company estimates that products introduced in the last two years accounted for approximately 25 of 2010 net sales the company’s longterm results of operations depend substantially upon its ability to continue to conceive design source and market new products and upon continuing market acceptance of its existing and future product lines in the ordinary course of business the company continually develops or creates new product line concepts if the company fails to or is significantly delayed in introducing new product line concepts or if the company’s new products do not meet with market acceptance its business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected

the provision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 243 in 2010 and 267 in 2009 the 2010 tax rate reflects a reduction in tax expense of 207 million relating primarily to reserve adjustments from the favorable settlement of certain international tax positions and the completion of prior year audits the 2009 tax rate reflects a reduction in tax expense of 36 million for tax reserve adjustments relating to the completion of the audit of certain of the company’s prior year tax returns excluding these adjustments the company’s effective tax rate for 2010 and 2009 was 274 and 275 respectively 

  

the company is present in over fifty taxable jurisdictions and at any point in time has numerous audits underway at various stages of completion with few exceptions the company is subject to income tax examinations by tax authorities for the years 

  

  

2007 and after the company is generally not able to precisely estimate the ultimate settlement amounts or timing until the close of an audit the company evaluates its tax positions and establishes liabilities for uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local authorities and may not be fully sustained despite the company’s belief that the underlying tax positions are fully supportable as of december 31 2010 the amount of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits which if recognized would impact the effective tax rate was approximately 233 million the majority of which is included in other longterm liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets unrecognized tax benefits are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted for changing facts and circumstances including progress of tax audits and closing of statute of limitations based on information currently available management anticipates that over the next twelve month period audit activity could be completed and statutes of limitations may close relating to existing unrecognized tax benefits of approximately 48 million 

  

  

2009 compared to 2008 

  

net sales were 28201   million for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to 32365 million for 2008 a decrease of 13 in us dollars 12 in local currencies and 16 organically excluding both currency and acquisition impacts sales of interconnect products and assemblies in 2009 approximately 91 of net sales decreased 13 in us dollars and 12 in local currencies compared to 2008 25666 million in 2009 versus 29506 million in 2008 sales decreased in the company’s major end markets including the industrial telecommunications and data communications automotive wireless communications and militaryaerospace markets as a result of the global economic downturn the industrial market sales decreased approximately 1139 million reflecting significantly lower demand for a broad range of industrial equipment including factory automation natural resource exploration heavy equipment and railwaymass transit the telecommunications and data communications market sales decreased approximately 1648 million primarily due to reduced sales of high speed interconnect products for servers and switching as well as network and storage equipment reflecting significantly lower enterprise and data center equipment demand sales to the automotive market decreased approximately 423 million primarily due to the general softness in the domestic and european automotive markets the wireless communications market sales decreased approximately 461 million in primarily all areas including the mobile device market primarily related to lower handset demand and the wireless infrastructure market due to lower demand at base stationequipment manufacturers partially offset by increased sales to cell site installation customers primarily due to the impact of acquisitions sales to the militaryaerospace markets decreased approximately 208 million primarily due to lower demand in the commercial aircraft market and to a lesser extent the defense market partially offset by the impact of acquisitions sales of cable products in 2009 approximately 9 of net sales decreased 11 in us dollars and 9 in local currencies compared to 2008 2535 million in 2009 versus 2859 million in 2008 this decrease is primarily attributable to a slowdown in spending in domestic and international broadband and cable television markets resulting from weak economic conditions 

  

geographically sales in the us in 2009 decreased approximately 14 in us dollars 10017 million in 2009 versus 11593 million in 2008 and decreased approximately 13 in local currencies international sales for 2009 decreased approximately 12 in us dollars 18183 million in 2009 versus 20772 million in 2008 and decreased approximately 11 in local currencies compared to 2008 the comparatively stronger us dollar in 2009 had the effect of decreasing net sales by approximately 382 million when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2008 

  

the gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was 314 in 2009 compared to 324 in 2008 the operating margin for interconnect products and assemblies decreased approximately 23 compared to the prior year primarily as a result of reduced volume levels given the current economic environment partially offset by effective cost control programs cable operating margins increased 39 primarily as a result of the positive impacts of lower material costs and operational cost reduction actions which more than offset the impact of lower sales volume 

  

selling general and administrative expenses were 3976 million and 4169 million in 2009 and 2008 or approximately 14 and 13 of net sales for 2009 and 2008 respectively the decrease in expense in 2009 is primarily attributable to lower sales volume and the positive effects of cost reduction actions selling and marketing expenses decreased approximately 129 million in 2009 due primarily to the lower sales volume and the impact on sales related costs such as freight and employee related costs research and development expenditures decreased approximately 41 million administrative expenses decreased approximately 23 million and represented approximately 50 and 45 of sales for 2009 and 2008 respectively 

  

interest expense was 366 million for 2009 compared to 396 million for 2008 the decrease is primarily attributable to lower average interest rates in 2009 partially offset by higher average debt levels the company incurred a 46 million charge or 02 per share for the early extinguishment of certain interest rate swaps in 2009 

  

the provision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 267 in 2009 and 275 in 2008 the lower effective tax rate in 2009 results primarily from a smaller decrease in income during 2009 in lower rate jurisdictions and includes a reduction in tax expense of 36 million for tax reserve adjustments relating to the completion of the audit of certain of the company’s prior year tax returns 

  

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

cash flow provided by operating activities was 4249 million for 2010 cash flow provided by operating activities was reduced by 820 million related to the effect of adoption of asu 200916 refer to note 3 to the consolidated financial statements cash flow provided by operating activities excluding the effect of adoption of asu 200916 was 5069 million compared to 5823 million and 4815 million 2009 and 2008 respectively excluding the effect of adoption the decrease in cash flow provided by operating activities in 2010 compared to 2009 is primarily attributable to an increase in the components of working capital compared to decreases in these components in 2009 offset by an increase in net income and an increase in noncash expenses including depreciation and stockbased compensation expense the increase in cash flow provided by operating activities in 2009 compared to 2008 is primarily attributable to decreases in the components of working capital compared to increases in these components in 2008 and an increase in depreciation and amortization partially offset by a decrease in net income 

  

the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flow increased 1201million in 2010 due primarily to a 1577 million increase in accounts receivable an increase of 652 million in inventory and an increase of 56 million in other current assets partially offset by a 769 million increase in accounts payable and a 315 million increase in accrued liabilities 

  

the components of working capital decreased 1256 million in 2009 due primarily to decreases in accounts receivable inventory and other current assets of 966 million 763 million and 60 million respectively offset by a 317 million decrease in accounts payable a 30 million decrease in accounts receivable sold under the company’s receivable securitization program and a 26 million decrease in accrued liabilities 

  

the components of working capital increased 400 million in 2008 due primarily to increases in inventory of 476 million and other current assets of 75 million partially offset by a 322 million increase in accrued liabilities a 27 million increase in accounts payable and a 15 million decrease in accounts receivable 

  

the following represents the significant changes in the amounts as presented on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets in 2010 accounts receivable increased 2690 million to 7185 million resulting from the inclusion of 820 million of receivables previously sold under the company’s receivables securitization facility in accordance with the adoption of asu 200916 refer to note 3 to the consolidated financial statements and also reflecting higher sales levels the impact of acquisitions of 220 million and translation resulting from the comparatively weaker us dollar at december 31 2010 compared to december 31 2009 “translation” for further discussion of the adoption of asu 200916 refer to note 3 to the consolidated financial statements days sales outstanding increased to approximately 68 days from 64 days in 2009 inventory increased 874 million to 5492 million primarily due to the impact of higher sales activity the impact of acquisitions of 188 million and translation inventory days at december 31 2010 and 2009 were 77 and 80 respectively land and depreciable assets net increased 341 million to 3670 million reflecting capital expenditures of 1095 million as well as assets from acquisitions of approximately 142 million and translation offset by depreciation of 861 million and disposals goodwill increased 1646 million to 15333 million primarily as a result of two acquisitions in the interconnect products and assemblies segment completed during the year other longterm assets increased 262 million to 1234 million primarily due to an increase in identifiable intangible assets resulting from 2010 acquisitions partially offset by a decrease in longterm deferred tax assets of 92 million accounts payable increased 928 million to 3850 million primarily as a result of an increase in purchasing activity during the year related to higher sales levels and due to the impact of acquisitions of 148 million accrued acquisitionrelated obligations increased 324 million to 396 million primarily reflecting contingent consideration obligations of 396 million relating to an acquisition completed in 2010 partially offset by payments and adjustments to accrued acquisitionrelated obligations relating to previous acquisitions other longterm liabilities increased 140 million to 419 million primarily due to contingent consideration obligations expected to be paid in 2012 associated with the aforementioned acquisition in 2010 

  

in 2010 cash flow provided by operating activities of 4249 million proceeds from the exercise of stock options including excess tax benefits from stockbased payment arrangements of 613 million net borrowings of 454 million and proceeds from disposal of fixed assets of 19 million were used to fund acquisitionrelated payments of 1804 million capital expenditures of 1095 million purchases of shortterm investments of 602 million payments to shareholders of noncontrolling interests of 246 million dividend payments of 104 million and to fund fees and expenses in connection with refinancing the company’s revolving credit facility of 70 million which resulted in an increase in cash and cash equivalents of 1413 million in 2009 cash flow provided by from operating activities of 5823 million proceeds from the issuance of senior notes of 5989 million proceeds from the exercise of stock options including excess tax benefits from stockbased payment arrangements of 416 million and proceeds from disposal of fixed assets of 32 million were used to fund 2800 million of acquisitions including payments for performancebased additional cash consideration capital expenditures of 631 million purchases of shortterm investments of 333 million payments to shareholders of noncontrolling interests of 233 million dividend payments 

  

  

of 103 million net repayments of the revolving credit facility and foreign debt of 6319 million costs related to the issuance of senior notes and the early extinguishment of interest rate swap agreements of 47 million and 46 million respectively which resulted in an increase in cash and cash equivalents on hand of 1696 million at december 31 2010 and 2009 the company had cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 6242 million and 4224 million respectively the majority of these amounts are located outside of the us 

  

in november 2009 the company issued 6000 million in principal amount of its unsecured 475 senior notes due in november 2014 the “senior notes” at 99813 of their face value 09 million unamortized at december 31 2010 net proceeds from the sale of the senior notes were used to repay borrowings under the company’s senior credit facility in addition the company incurred fees and expenses related to the senior notes of 47 million which were deferred and are being amortized using the effective interest method over the term of the senior notes as interest expense interest on the senior notes is payable semiannually on may 15 and november 15 of each year to the holders of record as of the immediately preceding may 1 and november 1 the company may at its option redeem some or all of the senior notes at any time by paying a makewhole premium plus accrued and unpaid interest if any to the date of repurchase the senior notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the company’s other unsecured senior indebtedness the fair value of the senior notes at december 31 2010 was approximately 6387 million based on recent bid prices 

  

in august 2010 the company refinanced its senior credit facility the new 10000 million unsecured revolving credit facility the “revolving credit facility” matures in august 2014 the net proceeds from the refinancing were used to repay 2470 million of borrowings outstanding under the company’s previous senior unsecured credit facility at december 31 2010 borrowings and availability under the facility were 1036 million and 8964 million respectively the company’s interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility is libor plus 225 basis points the company also pays certain annual agency and commitment fees the revolving credit facility requires that the company satisfy certain financial covenants at december 31 2010 the company was in compliance with such financial covenants in connection with the refinancing the company incurred onetime expenses for the early extinguishment of debt of 05 million relating to unamortized deferred debt issue costs these costs are included in interest expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of income the company also paid fees and expenses of 69 million in conjunction with the new revolving credit facility which are deferred and amortized into interest expense through its maturity 

  

a subsidiary of the company has an agreement with a financial institution whereby the subsidiary can sell an undivided interest of up to 1000 million in a designated pool of qualified accounts receivable the “receivables securitization facility” the company services administers and collects the receivables on behalf of the purchaser the receivables securitization facility includes certain covenants and provides for various events of termination and expires in may 2013 in accordance with previous accounting guidance the receivables sold under the receivables securitization facility were accounted for offbalance sheet as a sale of receivables as discussed in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements the company adopted asu 200916 on january 1 2010 as a result the company no longer accounts for the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors under the receivables securitization facility as a sale in addition transfers of receivables occurring on or after january 1 2010 are reflected as debt issued in the company’s consolidated statements of cash flows and the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors at december 31 2010 is accounted for as a secured borrowing and is included in the company’s consolidated balance sheets as longterm debt at december 31 2010 borrowings under the receivables securitization facility were 920 million at december 31 2009 820 million of receivables were sold and were therefore not reflected in accounts receivable and longterm debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets additionally in accordance with asu 200916 fees incurred in connection with the receivables securitization facility which were included in other expense net for prior periods are now included in interest expense such fees were approximately 15 million for both 2010 and 2009 

  

the carrying value of the company’s revolving credit facility and receivables securitization facility approximated their fair value at december 31 2010 

  

the company’s primary ongoing cash requirements will be for operating and capital expenditures product development activities repurchase of its common stock funding of pension obligations dividends and debt service the company may also use cash to fund all or part of the cost of acquisitions the company expects that capital expenditures in 2011 will be approximately 1200 to 1400 million the company pays a quarterly dividend on its common stock of 015 per share cumulative dividends declared and paid during 2010 were 104 million including those declared in 2009 and paid in 2010 the company’s debt service requirements consist primarily of principal and interest on senior notes the revolving credit facility and its receivables securitization facility 

  

the company’s primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flow the revolving credit facility the receivables securitization facility and cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments the company expects that ongoing cash 

  

  

requirements will be funded from these sources however the company’s sources of liquidity could be adversely affected by among other things a decrease in demand for the company’s products a deterioration in certain of the company’s financial ratios or a deterioration in the quality of the company’s accounts receivable however management believes that the company’s cash cash equivalents and shortterm investment position ability to generate strong cash flow from operations availability under its revolving credit facility and its receivables securitization facility will allow it to meet its obligations for the next twelve months 

  

the company had an openmarket stock repurchase program the “program” to repurchase up to 20 million shares of its common stock which expired on january 31 2010 the company did not purchase any shares of its common stock under the program or otherwise in 2010 in january 2011 the company announced that its board of directors authorized a new stock repurchase program under which the company may repurchase up to 20 million shares of its common stock during the three year period ending january 31 2014 the price and timing of any such purchases will depend on factors such as debt levels of cash generation from operations the volume of stock option exercises by employees cash requirements for acquisitions economic and market conditions and stock price 

  

environmental matters 

  

subsequent to the acquisition of amphenol from allied signal corporation “allied signal” in 1987 allied signal merged with honeywell international inc in december 1999 “honeywell” the company and honeywell were named jointly and severally liable as potentially responsible parties in connection with several environmental cleanup sites the company and honeywell jointly consented to perform certain investigations and remediation and monitoring activities at two sites the “route 8” landfill and the “richardson hill road” landfill and they were jointly ordered to perform work at another site the “sidney” landfill all of the costs incurred relating to these three sites are currently reimbursed by honeywell based on an agreement the “honeywell agreement” entered into in connection with the acquisition in 1987 management does not believe that the costs associated with resolution of these or any other environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations the environmental investigations remediation and monitoring activities identified by the company including those referred to above are covered under the honeywell agreement 

  

inflation and costs 

  

the cost of the company’s products is influenced by the cost of a wide variety of raw materials including precious metals such as gold and silver used in plating aluminum copper brass and steel used for contacts shells and cable and plastic materials used in molding connector bodies inserts and cable in general increases in the cost of raw materials labor and services have been offset by price increases productivity improvements and cost saving programs 

  

risk management 

  

the company has to a significant degree mitigated its exposure to currency risk in its business operations by manufacturing and procuring its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold so that costs generally reflect local economic conditions in other cases involving us export sales raw materials are a significant component of product costs for the majority of such sales and raw material costs are generally dollar based on a worldwide scale such as basic metals and petroleumderived materials 

  

adoption of new accounting pronouncements 

  

in june 2009 the fasb issued asu 200916 which limits the circumstances in which transferred financial assets can be derecognized and requires enhanced disclosures regarding transfers of financial assets and a transferor’s continuing involvement with transferred financial assets the company adopted asu 200916 on january 1 2010 as a result the company no longer accounts for the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors under the company’s receivables securitization facility as a sale in addition transfers of receivables occurring on or after january 1 2010 are reflected as debt issued in the company’s consolidated statements of cash flow resulting in a reduction of cash flow provided by operating activities and increase in cash provided by financing activities of 820 million for the year ended december 31 2010 and recognized as longterm debt in the company’s consolidated balance sheets refer to the discussion of the company’s receivables securitization facility in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

in january 2010 the fasb issued new guidance to enhance disclosure requirements related to fair value measurements by requiring certain new disclosures and clarifying certain existing disclosures this new guidance requires disclosure of the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level 1 and level 2 recurring fair value measurements and the reasons for the transfers in addition the new guidance requires additional information related to activities in the reconciliation of level 3 fair 

  

  

value measurements the new guidance also expands the disclosures related to the disaggregation of assets and liabilities and information about inputs and valuation techniques the new guidance related to level 1 and level 2 fair value measurements was effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2009 and the new guidance related to level 3 fair value measurements was effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2010 and interim periods during those fiscal years effective january 1 2010 the company adopted the new guidance related to level 1 and level 2 fair value measurements the company’s adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and related notes refer to the fair value measurements disclosure in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

pensions 

  

the company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries have two defined benefit pension plans “us plans” which subject to the curtailment described below cover its us employees and which represent the majority of the plan assets and benefit obligations of the aggregate defined benefit plans of the company the us plans’ benefits are generally based on years of service and compensation and are generally noncontributory certain us employees not covered by the us plans are covered by defined contribution plans certain foreign subsidiaries also have defined benefit plans covering their employees the “international plans” the pension expense for the us plans and international plans the “plans” approximated 180 million 165 million and 122 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively and is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions established on january 1 of the applicable year including a weighted — average discount rate rate increase of future compensation levels and an expected longterm rate of return on the respective plans’ assets 

  

the discount rate used by the company for valuing pension liabilities is based on a review of high quality corporate bond yields with maturities approximating the remaining life of the projected benefit obligations the discount rate for the us plans on this basis was 520 at december 31 2010 and 575 at december 31 2009 although future changes to the discount rate are unknown had the discount rate increased or decreased 50 basis points the accrued benefit obligation would have decreased or increased by approximately 198 million 

  

in developing the expected longterm rate of return assumption for the us plans the company evaluated input from its external actuaries and investment consultants as well as longterm inflation assumptions projected returns by such consultants are based on broad equity and bond indices the company also considered its historical twentyyear compounded return of approximately 10 which has been in excess of these broad equity and bond benchmark indices the expected longterm rate of return on the us plans’ assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of 60 with equity managers with an expected longterm rate of return of approximately 9 and 40 with fixed income managers with an expected longterm rate of return of approximately 7 as of december 31 2010 the asset allocation was 59 with equity managers and 36 with fixed income managers and 5 in cash as of december 31 2009 the asset allocation was 59 with equity managers and 38 with fixed income managers and 3 in cash the company believes that the longterm asset allocation on average will approximate 60 with equity managers and 40 with fixed income managers the company regularly reviews the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances investments to its targeted allocation when considered appropriate based on this methodology the company’s expected longterm rate of return assumption to determine the accrued benefit obligation of the us plans at both december 31 2010 and 2009 is approximately 825 

  

effective january 1 2007 the company effected a curtailment related to one of the us plans which resulted in no additional benefits being credited to salaried employees who had less than 25 years of service with the company or who had not attained age 50 and who had less than 15 years of service with the company for affected employees the curtailment in additional us plan benefits was replaced with a company match defined contribution plan to which the company contributed approximately 22 million and 20 million in 2010 and 2009 respectively 

  

the company made cash contributions to the plans of 173 million and 26 million in 2010 and 2009 respectively the total liability for accrued pension and postemployment benefit obligations under the company’s pension and postretirement benefit plans increased in 2010 to 1799 million 33 million of which is included in other accrued expenses representing required contributions to be made during 2011 for unfunded foreign plans from 1765 million in 2009 primarily due to a reduction of the discount rate assumption compared to 2009 offset by an increase in plan assets the company estimates that based on current actuarial calculations it will make a cash contribution to the plans in 2011 of approximately 194 million the majority of which is related to the us plans cash contributions in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors including the investment performance of the respective plans’ assets 

  

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates estimates are adjusted as new information becomes available the company’s significant accounting policies are set forth below 

  

revenue recognition  the company’s primary source of revenues is from product sales to its customers revenue from sales of the company’s products is recognized at the time the goods are delivered and title passes provided the earning process is complete and revenue is measurable delivery is determined by the company’s shipping terms which are primarily freight on board shipping point revenue is recorded at the net amount to be received after deductions for estimated discounts allowances and returns these estimates and reserves are determined and adjusted as needed based upon historical experience contract terms and other related factors the shipping costs for the majority of the company’s sales are paid directly by the company’s customers in the broadband communication market approximately 7 of consolidated sales the company pays for shipping cost to the majority of its customers shipping costs are also paid by the company for certain customers in the interconnect products and assemblies segment amounts billed to customers related to shipping costs are immaterial and are included in net sales shipping costs incurred to transport products to the customer which are not reimbursed are included in selling general and administrative expense 

  

inventories  inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost which approximates average cost or market provisions for slowmoving and obsolete inventory are made based on historical experience and product demand should future product demand change existing inventory could become slowmoving or obsolete and provisions would be increased accordingly 

  

depreciable assets  property plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation the appropriateness and the recoverability of the carrying value of such assets are periodically reviewed taking into consideration current and expected business conditions the company has not recorded any significant impairments 

  

goodwill  the company performs its annual evaluation for the impairment of goodwill for the company’s reporting units in accordance with asc topic intangibles — goodwill and other as of each june 30 the company has defined its reporting units as the two reportable business segments “interconnect products and assemblies” and “cable products” as the components of these reportable business segments have similar economic characteristics goodwill impairment for each reporting unit is evaluated using a twostep approach requiring the company to determine the fair value of the reporting unit and to compare that to the carrying value of the reporting unit if the carrying value exceeded the fair value the goodwill of the reporting unit would be potentially impaired and a second step of testing would be performed to measure the impairment loss the second step of the goodwill impairment test would require the comparison of the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill to the carrying amount of that goodwill if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds its fair value an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the excess the second step of the goodwill impairment test was not required 

  

as of june 30 2010 and for each previous year in which the impairment test has been performed the fair market value of the company’s reporting units exceeded their carrying values and therefore no impairment was recognized 

  

defined benefit plan obligation  the defined benefit plan obligation is based on significant assumptions such as mortality rates discount rates and plan asset rates of return as determined by the company in consultation with the respective benefit plan actuaries and investment advisors 

  

income taxes  deferred income taxes are provided for revenue and expenses which are recognized in different periods for income tax and financial statement purposes deferred income taxes are not provided on undistributed earnings of foreign affiliated companies which are considered to be permanently invested it is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if undistributed earnings were to be repatriated deferred tax assets are regularly assessed for recoverability based on both historical and anticipated earnings levels and a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that these amounts will not be recovered the tax effects of an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns are recognized only if it is “more likely than not” to be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on its technical merits as of the reporting date the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement the company includes estimated interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes 

  

the significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 to the company’s consolidated financial statements 

  

  

disclosures about contractual obligations and commitments 

  

the following table summarizes the company’s known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of december 31 2010 as well as an estimate of the timing in which such obligations are expected to be satisfied 

  

   

1   the company has excluded expected interest payments on the revolving credit facility and the receivables securitization facility from the above table as this calculation is largely dependent on average debt levels the company expects to have at the end of each of the years presented the actual interest payments made related to the revolving credit facility and receivables securitization facility in 2010 were 111 million expected debt levels and therefore expected interest payments are difficult to predict as they are significantly impacted by such items as future acquisitions repurchases of treasury stock dividend payments as well as payments or additional borrowing made to reduce or increase the underlying revolver balance 

2   accrued acquisitionrelated obligations consist of obligations for additional purchase price and performancebased cash consideration 

3   included in this table are estimated benefit payments expected to be made under the company’s unfunded pension and postretirement benefit plans the company also maintains several funded pension and postretirement benefit plans the most significant of which covers its us employees over the past several years there has been no minimum requirement for company contributions to the us plans due to prior contributions made in excess of minimum requirements however the company did make a voluntary contribution of approximately 15 million in 2010 the company anticipates making a contribution to the us plans of approximately 15 million in 2011 an anticipated minimum required contribution of approximately 13 million was included in the above table related to the us plans for 2011 it is not possible to reasonably estimate expected required contributions in the above table after 2011 since several assumptions are required to calculate minimum required contributions such as the discount rate and expected returns on pension assets 

4   as of december 31 2010 the company has noncurrent liabilities of approximately 233 million recognized in accordance with the income taxes topic of the asc these liabilities have been excluded from the above table due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows it is difficult to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid

environmental matters 

  

certain operations of the company are subject to environmental laws and regulations which govern the discharge of pollutants into the air and water as well as the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes the company believes that its operations are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that the costs of continuing compliance will not have a material effect on the company’s financial condition or results of operations 

  

subsequent to the acquisition of amphenol from allied signal corporation “allied signal” in 1987 allied signal merged with honeywell international inc in december 1999 “honeywell” the company and honeywell were named jointly and severally liable as potentially responsible parties in connection with several environmental cleanup sites the company and honeywell jointly consented to perform certain investigations and remediation and monitoring activities at two sites the “route 8” landfill and the “richardson hill road” landfill and they were jointly ordered to perform work at another site the “sidney” landfill the costs incurred relating to these three sites are currently reimbursed by honeywell based on an agreement the “honeywell agreement” entered into in connection with the acquisition in 1987 for sites covered by the honeywell agreement to the extent that conditions or circumstances occurred or existed at the time of or prior to the acquisition in 1987 honeywell is obligated to reimburse the company 100 of such costs honeywell representatives continue to work closely with the company in addressing the most significant environmental liabilities covered by the honeywell agreement management does not believe that the costs associated with resolution of these or any other environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations the environmental investigation remediation and monitoring activities identified by the company including those referred to above are covered under the honeywell agreement 

  

owners and occupiers of sites containing hazardous substances as well as generators of hazardous substances are subject to broad liability under various federal and state environmental laws and regulations including expenditures for cleanup and monitoring costs and potential damages arising out of past disposal activities such liability in many cases may be imposed regardless of fault or the legality of the original disposal activity the company has performed remediation activities and is currently performing operations and maintenance and monitoring activities at three offsite disposal sites previously utilized by the company’s sidney facility and others to wit the richardson hill road landfill the route 8 landfill and the sidney landfill actions at the richardson hill road and sidney landfills were undertaken subsequent to designation as “superfund” sites on the national priorities list under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 the route 8 landfill was designated as a new york state inactive hazardous waste disposal site with remedial actions taken pursuant to chapter 6 section 3751 of the new york code of rules and regulations in addition the company is currently performing monitoring activities at and in proximity to its manufacturing site in sidney new york the company is also engaged in remediating or monitoring environmental conditions at certain of its other manufacturing facilities and has been named as a potentially responsible party for cleanup costs at other offsite disposal sites all such environmental matters referred to in this paragraph are covered by the honeywell agreement 

  

since 1987 the company has not been identified nor has it been named as a potentially responsible party with respect to any other significant onsite or offsite hazardous waste matters in addition the company believes that its manufacturing activities and disposal practices since 1987 have been in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations nonetheless it is possible that the company will be named as a potentially responsible party in the future with respect to additional superfund or other sites although the company is unable to predict with any reasonable certainty the extent of its ultimate liability with respect to any pending or future environmental matters the company believes based upon information currently known by management about the company’s manufacturing activities disposal practices and estimates of liability with respect to known environmental matters that any such liability will not be material to its financial condition or results of operations

if any of the following risks actually occur the company’s business and consolidated financial statements could be materially adversely affected in such case the trading price of the company’s common stock could decline and investors may lose all or part of their investment 

  

the company is dependent on the communications industry including telecommunication and data communication wireless communications and broadband communications 

  

approximately 61 of the company’s revenues for the year ended december 31 2009 came from sales to the communications industry including telecommunication and data communication wireless communications and broadband communications demand for these products is subject to rapid technological change see below—“the company is dependent on the acceptance of new product introductions for continued revenue growth” these markets are dominated by several large manufacturers and operators who regularly exert significant price pressure on their suppliers including the company the loss of one or more of the large communications customers could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to compete successfully in the communications industry and the company’s failure to do so could have an adverse effect on the company’s results of operations 

  

approximately 10 of the company’s 2009 revenues came from sales to the broadband communications industry demand for the company’s broadband communications products depends primarily on capital spending by cable television operators for constructing rebuilding or upgrading their systems the amount of this capital spending and therefore the company’s sales and profitability will be affected by a variety of factors including general economic conditions acquisitions of cable television operators by noncable television operators cable system consolidation within the industry the financial condition of domestic cable television operators and their access to financing competition from satellite telephone and television providers and telephone companies technological developments and new legislation and regulation of cable television operators there can be no assurance that existing levels of cable television capital spending will continue or that cable television spending will not decrease 

  

changes in defense expenditures may reduce the company’s sales 

  

approximately 18 of the company’s 2009 revenues came from sales to the military market the company participates in a broad spectrum of defense programs and believes that no one program accounted for more than 1 of its 2009 revenues the substantial majority of these sales are related to both us and foreign military and defense programs however the company’s sales are generally to contractors and subcontractors of the us or foreign governments or to distributors that in turn sell to the contractors and subcontractors nevertheless the company’s sales are affected by changes in the defense budgets of the us and foreign governments a decline in us defense expenditures and defense expenditures generally could adversely affect the company’s business 

  

the company encounters competition in substantially all areas of its business 

  

the company competes primarily on the basis of technology innovation product quality price customer service and delivery time competitors include large diversified companies some of which have substantially greater assets and financial resources than the company as well as medium to small companies there can be no assurance that additional competitors will not enter the company’s existing markets nor can there be any assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against existing or new competition and the inability to do so could have an adverse effect on the company’s business and operations 

  

the company is dependent on the acceptance of new product introductions for continued revenue growth 

  

the company estimates that products introduced in the last two years accounted for approximately 25 of 2009 net sales the company’s longterm results of operations depend substantially upon its ability to continue to conceive design source and market new products and upon continuing market acceptance of its existing and future product lines in the ordinary course of 

  

  

business the company continually develops or creates new product line concepts if the company fails to or is significantly delayed in introducing new product line concepts or if the company’s new products do not meet with market acceptance our results of operations may be adversely affected 

  

covenants in the company’s credit agreements may adversely affect the company 

  

the company’s revolving credit facility contains financial and other covenants such as a limit on the ratio of debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization minimum levels of net worth and limits on incurrence of liens although the company believes none of these covenants are presently restrictive to the company’s operations the ability to meet the financial covenants can be affected by events beyond the company’s control and the company cannot provide assurance that the company will meet those tests a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the company’s credit agreements upon the occurrence of an event of default under any of the company’s credit facilities the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding there under to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit if the lenders accelerate the repayment of borrowings the company may not have sufficient assets to repay the company’s credit facilities and other indebtedness see “liquidity and capital resources” 

  

downgrades of the company’s debt rating could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial position 

  

if the credit rating agencies that rate the company’s debt were to downgrade the company’s credit rating in conjunction with a deterioration of the company’s performance it may increase the company’s cost of capital and make it more difficult for the company to obtain new financing which could adversely affect the company’s business 

  

the company’s results may be negatively affected by changing interest rates  

  

the company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on the company’s financing activities in november 2009 the company issued 6000 million of unsecured senior notes at a discount of 99813 due in november 2014 with a fixed interest rate of 475 the company also utilizes interest rate swap agreements to manage and mitigate its exposure to changes in interest rates for amounts outstanding on its revolving credit facility as of december 31 2009 the company had interest rate protection in the form of swaps that effectively fixed the company’s libor interest rate on 1500 million at 473 expiring in july 2010 

  

a 10 change in the libor interest rate at december 31 2009 would have no material effect on interest expense the company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2010 although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly change 

  

the company’s results may be negatively affected by foreign currency exchange rates 

  

the company conducts business in several international currencies through its worldwide operations and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the company’s sales gross margins and shareholders’ equity the company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk by producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency and by managing its working capital there can be no assurance that this approach will be successful especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the company’s worldwide operations which could have an adverse effect on the results of the company’s operations 

  

the company is subject to the risks of political economic and military instability in countries outside the united states 

  

nonus markets account for a substantial portion of the company’s business during 2009 nonus markets constituted approximately 64 of the company’s net sales the company employs more than 88 of its workforce outside the united states the company’s customers are located throughout the world and it has many manufacturing administrative and sales facilities outside the united states because of the company’s extensive nonus operations it is exposed to risks that could negatively affect sales or profitability including 

  

·   tariffs trade barriers and trade disputes 

·   regulations related to customs and importexport matters 

·   longer payment cycles 

  

  

·   tax issues such as tax law changes examinations by taxing authorities variations in tax laws from country to country as compared to the united states and difficulties in repatriating in a taxefficient manner cash generated or held abroad 

·   challenges in collecting accounts receivable 

·   employment regulations and local labor conditions 

·   difficulties protecting intellectual property 

·   instability in economic or political conditions including inflation recession and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts and

2009 compared to 2008 

  

net sales were 28201   million for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to 32365 million for 2008 a decrease of 13 in us dollars 12 in local currencies and 16 organically excluding both currency and acquisition impacts sales of interconnect products and assemblies in 2009 approximately 91 of net sales decreased 13 in us dollars and 12 in local currencies compared to 2008 25666 million in 2009 versus 29506 million in 2008 sales decreased in the company’s major end markets including the industrial telecommunications and data communications automotive wireless communications and militaryaerospace markets as a result of the global economic downturn the industrial market sales decreased approximately 1139 million reflecting significantly lower demand for a broad range of industrial equipment including factory automation natural resource exploration heavy equipment and railwaymass transit the telecommunications and data communications market sales decreased approximately 1648 million primarily due to reduced sales of high speed interconnect products for servers and switching as well as network and storage equipment reflecting significantly lower enterprise and data center equipment demand sales to the automotive market decreased approximately 423 million primarily due to the general softness in the domestic and european automotive markets the wireless communications market sales decreased approximately 461 million in primarily all areas including the mobile device market primarily related to lower handset demand and the wireless infrastructure market due to lower demand at base stationequipment manufacturers partially offset by increased sales to cell site installation customers primarily due to the impact of acquisitions sales to the militaryaerospace markets decreased approximately 208 million primarily due to lower demand in the commercial aircraft market and to a lesser extent the defense market partially offset by the impact of acquisitions sales of cable products in 2009 approximately 9 of net sales decreased 11 in us dollars and 9 in local currencies compared to 2008 2535 million in 2009 versus 2859 million in 2008 this decrease is primarily attributable to a slowdown in spending in domestic and international broadband and cable television markets resulting from weak economic conditions 

  

geographically sales in the us in 2009 decreased approximately 14 in us dollars 10017 million in 2009 versus 11593 million in 2008 and decreased approximately 13 in local currencies international sales for 2009 decreased approximately 12 in us dollars 18183 million in 2009 versus 20772 million in 2008 and decreased approximately 11 in local currencies compared to 2008 the comparatively stronger us dollar in 2009 had the effect of decreasing net sales by approximately 382 million when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2008 

  

the gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was 314 in 2009 compared to 324 in 2008 the operating margin for interconnect products and assemblies decreased approximately 23 compared to the prior year primarily as a result of reduced volume levels given the current economic environment partially offset by effective cost control programs cable operating margins increased 39 primarily as a result of the positive impacts of lower material costs and operational cost reduction actions which more than offset the impact of lower sales volume 

  

selling general and administrative expenses were 3976 million and 4169 million in 2009 and 2008 or approximately 14 and 13 of net sales for 2009 and 2008 respectively the decrease in expense in 2009 is primarily attributable to lower sales volume and the positive effects of cost reduction actions selling and marketing expenses decreased approximately 129 million in 2009 due primarily to the lower sales volume and the impact on sales related costs such as freight and employee related costs research and development expenditures decreased approximately 41 million administrative expenses decreased approximately 23 million and represented approximately 50 and 45 of sales for 2009 and 2008 respectively 

  

interest expense was 366 million for 2009 compared to 396 million for 2008 the decrease is primarily attributable to lower average interest rates in 2009 partially offset by higher average debt levels the company incurred a 46 million charge or 02 per share for the early extinguishment of certain interest rate swaps in 2009 refer to” liquidity and capital resources” for further discussion 

  

the provision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 267 in 2009 and 275 in 2008   the lower effective tax rate in 2009 results primarily from a smaller decrease in income during 2009 in lower rate jurisdictions 

  

  

2008 compared to 2007 

  

net sales were 32365   million for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to 28510 million for 2007 an increase of 14 in us dollars and 12 in local currencies the increase in sales in 2008 over 2007 excluding acquisitions was 10 in us dollars and 9 in local currencies sales of interconnect products and assemblies in 2008 approximately 91 of net sales increased 15 in us dollars and 13 in local currencies compared to 2007 29506 million in 2008 versus 25693 million in 2007 sales increased in all of the company’s major end markets except automotive including the wireless communications militaryaerospace telecommunications and data communications and industrial markets the increase in sales in the wireless communications markets approximately 2052 million is attributable to increased sales to the mobile device market primarily relating to new products for mobile phones increased demand in the wireless infrastructure market from base stationequipment manufacturers and to a lesser extent increased sales to cell site installation customers sales to the militaryaerospace markets increased approximately 908 million primarily due to increased sales to military customers for various defense related programs including war related spending an increase in sales to commercial aerospace customers and the impact of acquisitions the increase in sales to the telecommunications and data communications related markets approximately 539 million reflects increased sales of high speed interconnect products for servers and switching and network equipment for data centers as well as the impact of acquisitions the increase in sales in the industrial market approximately 201 million primarily reflects the impact of acquisitions as well as increased sales to the natural resource exploration and railwaymass transit markets the automotive market was slightly down in 2008 approximately 30 million versus 2007 reflecting the general softness in the domestic and european automotive markets sales of cable products in 2008 approximately 9 of net sales increased 1 in us dollars and 3 in local currencies compared to 2007 2859 million in 2008 versus 2818 million in 2007 such increase is primarily due to the impact of price increases 

  

geographically sales in the us in 2008 and 2007 were relatively flat 11593 million in 2008 versus 11558 million in 2007 international sales for 2008 increased approximately 23 in us dollars 20772 million in 2008 versus 16952 million in 2007 and increased approximately 21 in local currency compared to 2007 the comparatively weak us dollar in 2008 had the effect of increasing net sales by approximately 343 million when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2007 

  

the gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was relatively flat at 324 in 2008 compared to 326 in 2007 the operating margin for interconnect products and assemblies increased approximately 03 compared to the prior year mainly as a result of the continuing development of new higher margin application specific products excellent operating leverage on incremental volume and aggressive programs of cost control cable operating margins decreased 10 due primarily to the impact of higher material costs for the majority of 2008 partially offset by the impact of price increases 

  

selling general and administrative expenses were 4169 million and 3773 million in 2008 and 2007 respectively or approximately 13 of net sales in both 2008 and 2007 the increase in expense in 2008 is attributable to increases in the major components of selling general and administrative expenses research and development expenditures increased approximately 57 million reflecting increases in expenditures for new product development and represented approximately 2 of sales for both 2008 and 2007 selling and marketing expense remained approximately 65 of sales for both 2008 and 2007 administrative expense which represented approximately 45 of sales for both 2008 and 2007 increased by approximately 161 million due primarily to increases in stockbased compensation expense of 39 million as well as cost increases relating to salaries and employeerelated benefits 

  

interest expense was 396 million for 2008 compared to 369 million for 2007 the increase is primarily attributable to the higher average debt levels in 2008 

  

other expenses net for 2008 were not significant other expenses net for 2007 were 45 million and are comprised primarily of program fees on the sale of accounts receivable of 52 million and agency and commitment fees on the company’s credit facilities of 18 million offset by interest income of 27 million 

  

the provision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 275 in 2008 and 289 in 2007   the lower effective tax rate results primarily from an increase in income in lower tax jurisdictions and changes in the company’s income repatriation plans the total effective rate reduction lowered tax expense in 2008 by approximately 83 million or an additional 04 per share 

  

  

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

cash provided by operating activities totaled 5823 million 4815 million and 3879 million for 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively the increase in cash from operating activities in 2009 compared to 2008 is primarily attributable to decreases in the components of working capital compared to increases in these components in 2008 and an increase in depreciation and amortization partially offset by a decrease in net income the increase in cash from operating activities in 2008 compared to 2007 is primarily attributable to an increase in net income an increase in depreciation and amortization and a lower increase in the components of working capital compared to the increase in 2007 

  

the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flow decreased 1256 million in 2009 due primarily to decreases in accounts receivable inventory and other current assets of 966 million 763 million and 60 million respectively offset by a 317 million decrease in accounts payable 161 million in excess tax benefits from stockbased payment arrangements a 30 million decrease in accounts receivable sold under the company’s receivable securitization program and a 26 million decrease in accrued liabilities 

  

the components of working capital increased 400 million in 2008 due primarily to increases in inventory of 476 million 213 million in excess tax benefits from stockbased payment arrangements and 75 million of other current assets partially offset by a 322 million increase in accrued liabilities a 27 million increase in accounts payable and a 15 million decrease in accounts receivable

the following represents the significant changes in the amounts as presented on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets in 2009 accounts receivable decreased 664 million to 4496 million primarily reflecting the impact of lower sales levels and a reduction in days sales outstanding partially offset by the impact of acquisitions of 188 million and translation resulting from the comparatively weaker us dollar at december 31 2009 compared to december 31 2008 “translation” days sales outstanding decreased to approximately 64 days from 72 days in 2008 inventory decreased 508 million to 4618 million primarily due to adjustments to production activity in response to lower demand levels offset by the impact of acquisitions of 201 million and translation inventory days at december 31 2009 and 2008 were 80 and 88 respectively other current assets increased 321 million to 1244 million primarily due to higher shortterm investments purchases during 2009 land and depreciable assets net decreased 116 million to 3329 million reflecting capital expenditures of 631 million as well as assets from acquisitions of approximately 100 million and translation of 59 million offset by depreciation of 851 million and disposals of 55 million goodwill increased 1363 million to 13687 million primarily as a result of two acquisitions in the interconnect products and assemblies segment completed during the year other longterm assets increased 158 million to 972 million primarily due to an increase in identifiable intangible assets resulting from 2009 acquisitions partially offset by a decrease in longterm deferred tax assets of 95 million accounts payable decreased 138 million to 2921 million primarily as a result of a decrease in purchasing activity during the year related to lower sales levels offset by the impact of acquisitions of 107 and translation total accrued liabilities decreased 1178 million primarily as a result of payments and adjustments made related to accrued acquisitionrelated obligations of 1131 million as well as a decrease in accrued foreign income taxes accrued pension and post employment benefit obligations increased 106 million to 1722 million due primarily to a higher projected benefit obligation as a result of a lower discount rate assumption offset by an increase in plan assets during the year other longterm liabilities decreased 152 million to 279 million due to the reclassification of the fair value of shortterm interest rate swaps to other accrued expenses in 2009

the subsequent events topic of the asc provides general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued in particular these standards set forth 1 the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements 2 the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements and 3 the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date certain standards within the subsequent events topic regarding disclosure became effective for interim or annual financial periods ending after june 15 2009 the company adopted such standards which did not have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements the company evaluated subsequent events through the date the accompanying financial statements were issued which was february 23 2010 

  

in june 2009 the transfers and servicing topic and the consolidation topic of the asc were amended specifically in terms of transfers of financial assets and consolidation of variable interest entities these standards apply prospectively to financial asset transfers occurring in fiscal years beginning after november 15 2009 to variable interest entities existing on or after november 15 2009 

  

the objective of the amendment to the transfers and servicing topic of the asc is to improve the relevance representational faithfulness and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial statements about a transfer of financial assets the effects of a transfer on its financial position financial performance and cash flows and a transferor’s continuing involvement if any in transferred financial assets this amendment eliminates the exemption from consolidation for qualifying special purpose entities “qspes” as a result a transferor must evaluate existing qspes to determine whether they must be consolidated in the reporting entity’s financial statements 

  

the objective of the amendment to the consolidation topic of the asc is to require an enterprise to perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprise’s variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity this analysis identifies the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity as the enterprise that has both of the following characteristics 1 the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and 2 the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity 

  

the company evaluated the amendments discussed above and as a result the company will report receivables sold under its receivable securitization agreement that are currently reported offbalance sheet as accounts receivable and shortterm debt on its consolidated balance sheets effective january 1 2010 as of december 31 2009 and december 31 2008 approximately 820 million and 850 million respectively of receivables were sold and are not reflected in accounts receivable or debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets fees associated with the accounts receivable agreement which are currently included in other expenses net will be included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of income the company’s credit ratios and ratings have always treated receivables sold under the accounts receivable agreement as debt and therefore these ratios and ratings will be unaffected by the adoption of the amendment to this topic 

  

pensions 

  

the company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries have a defined benefit pension plan “us plan” covering certain of its us employees us plan benefits are generally based on years of service and compensation and are generally noncontributory certain foreign subsidiaries also have defined benefit plans covering employees the pension expense for pension plans approximated 165 million 122 million and 161 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively and is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions established on january 1 of the applicable year including an expected longterm rate of return on the us plan assets in developing the expected longterm rate of return assumption for the us plan the company evaluated input from its external actuaries and investment consultants as well as longterm inflation assumptions projected returns by such consultants are based on broad equity and bond indices the company also considered its historical twentyyear compounded return of approximately 10 which has been in excess of these broad equity and bond benchmark indices the expected longterm rate of return on the us plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of 60 with equity managers with an expected longterm rate of return of 95 and 40 with fixed income managers with an expected longterm rate of return of 70 as of december 31 2009 the asset allocation was 59 with equity managers and 38 with fixed income managers and 3 in cash the company believes that the longterm asset allocation on average will approximate 60 with equity managers and 40 with fixed income managers the company regularly reviews the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances investments to its targeted allocation when considered appropriate based on this methodology the company’s expected longterm rate of return assumption to determine the accrued benefit obligation of the us plan at both december 31 2009 and 2008 was approximately 825 

  

  

the discount rate used by the company for valuing pension liabilities is based on a review of high quality corporate bond yields with maturities approximating the remaining life of the projected benefit obligations the discount rate for the us plan on this basis was 575 at december 31 2009 and 625 at december 31 2008 although future changes to the discount rate are unknown had the discount rate increased or decreased 50 basis points the accrued benefit obligation would have increased or decreased by approximately 162 million 

  

effective january 1 2007 the company effected a curtailment related to the us plan which resulted in no additional benefits being credited to salaried employees who had less than 25 years service with the company or who had not attained age 50 and who had less than 15 years of service with the company this change had the impact of decreasing pension expense during 2007 by approximately 29 million for affected employees the curtailment in additional us plan benefits was replaced with a company match defined contribution plan to which the company contributed approximately 20 million and 19 million in 2009 and 2008 respectively 

  

the company made cash contributions to the us plan of nil and 200 million in 2009 and 2008 respectively the us plan made benefit payments of 161 million and 165 million in 2009 and 2008 respectively the liability for accrued pension and postemployment benefit obligations under all the company’s pension and postretirement benefit plans the “plans” increased in 2009 to 1765 million 42 million of which is included in other accrued expenses representing required contributions to be made during 2010 for foreign plans from 1659 million in 2008 primarily due to a reduction of the discount rate assumption compared to 2008 offset by an increase in plan assets in the us plan the company estimates that based on current actuarial calculations it may make a voluntary cash contribution to the us plan in 2010 of approximately 150 million to 200 million cash contributions in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors including the investment performance of the us plan assets 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates estimates are adjusted as new information becomes available the company’s significant accounting policies are set forth below 

  

revenue recognition  the company’s primary source of revenues is from product sales to its customers revenue from sales of the company’s products is recognized at the time the goods are delivered and title passes provided the earning process is complete and revenue is measurable delivery is determined by the company’s shipping terms which are primarily fob shipping point revenue is recorded at the net amount to be received after deductions for estimated discounts allowances and returns these estimates and reserves are determined and adjusted as needed based upon historical experience contract terms and other related factors the shipping costs for the majority of the company’s sales are paid directly by the company’s customers in the broadband communication market approximately 10 of consolidated sales the company pays for shipping cost to the majority of its customers shipping costs are also paid by the company for certain customers in the interconnect products and assemblies segment amounts billed to customers related to shipping costs are immaterial and are included in net sales shipping costs incurred to transport products to the customer which are not reimbursed are included in selling general and administrative expense 

  

inventories  inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost which approximates average cost or market provisions for slowmoving and obsolete inventory are made based on historical experience and product demand should future product demand change existing inventory could become slowmoving or obsolete and provisions would be increased accordingly 

  

depreciable assets  property plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation the appropriateness and the recoverability of the carrying value of such assets are periodically reviewed taking into consideration current and expected business conditions the company has not had any significant impairments 

  

goodwill  the company performs its annual evaluation for the impairment of goodwill for the company’s reporting units in accordance with asc topic 350 intangibles — goodwill and other as of each june 30 the company has defined its reporting units as the two reportable business segments “interconnect products and assemblies” and “cable products” as the components of these reportable business segments have similar economic characteristics goodwill impairment for each reporting unit is evaluated using a twostep approach requiring the company to determine the fair value of the reporting unit and to compare that to the carrying value of the reporting unit if the carrying value exceeded the fair value the goodwill of the reporting unit would be potentially impaired and a second step of additional testing would be performed to measure the impairment loss as of june 30 2009 and for 

  

  

each previous year in which the impairment test has been performed the fair market value of the company’s reporting units exceeded their carrying values and therefore no impairment was recognized 

  

defined benefit plan obligation — the defined benefit plan obligation is based on significant assumptions such as mortality rates discount rates and plan asset rates of return as determined by the company in consultation with the respective benefit plan actuaries and investment advisors 

  

the significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 to the company’s consolidated financial statements 

  

disclosures about contractual obligations and commitments 

  

the following table summarizes the company’s known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of december 31 2009 as well as an estimate of the timing in which such obligations are expected to be satisfied 

  

   

1   the company has excluded expected interest payments on the revolving credit facility from the above table as this calculation is largely dependent on average debt levels the company expects to have at the end of each of the years presented as well as the expected interest rates on the debt not covered by interest rate swaps the actual interest payments made in 2009 were 38532 expected debt levels and therefore expected interest payments are difficult to predict as they are significantly impacted by such items as future acquisitions repurchases of treasury stock dividend payments as well as payments or additional borrowing made to reduce or increase the underlying revolver balance 

2   accrued acquisitionrelated obligations consist of obligations for additional purchase price and performancebased cash consideration 

3   included in this table are estimated benefit payments expected to be made under the company’s unfunded pension and postretirement benefit plans the company also maintains several funded pension and postretirement benefit plans the most significant of which covers its us employees over the past several years there has been no minimum requirement for company contributions to the us plan due to prior contributions made in excess of minimum requirements so the company did not make any such contributions in 2009 the company may make a voluntary contribution to the us plan in the range of 15000 to 20000 in 2010 as a result it is not possible to reasonably estimate expected required contributions in the above table since several assumptions are required to calculate the minimum required contributions such as the discount rate and expected returns on pension assets 

4   as of december 31 2009 the company has liabilities of 40208 recognized in accordance with the income taxes topic of the asc due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with the noncurrent liabilities it is very difficult to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these noncurrent liabilities might be paid 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

the company in the normal course of doing business is exposed to the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 

  

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

  

the company conducts business in several international currencies through its worldwide operations and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the company’s sales gross margins and retained earnings the company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk by producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency and by managing its working capital although there can be no assurance that this approach will be successful especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the company’s worldwide operations the company does not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes 

  

  

interest rate risk 

  

as of december 31 2009 the company had interest rate swap agreements that fix the company’s libor interest rate on 1500 million of floating rate bank debt at 473 expiring in july 2010 at december 31 2009 the company’s average libor rate was 473 a 10 change in the libor interest rate at december 31 2009 would have no material effect on interest expense the company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2010 although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly change 

  

in november 2009 the company issued 6000 million of unsecured senior notes at a discount of 99813 due in november 2014 with a fixed interest rate of 475

subsequent to the acquisition of amphenol from allied signal corporation “allied signal” in 1987 allied signal merged with honeywell international inc in december 1999 “honeywell” amphenol and honeywell were named jointly and severally liable as potentially responsible parties in relation to several environmental cleanup sites amphenol and honeywell jointly consented to perform certain investigations and remedial and monitoring activities at two sites the “route 8” landfill and the “richardson hill road” landfill and they were jointly ordered to perform work at another site the “sidney” landfill the costs incurred relating to these three sites are currently reimbursed by honeywell based on an agreement the “honeywell agreement” entered into in connection with the acquisition in 1987 for sites covered by the honeywell agreement to the extent that conditions or circumstances occurred or existed at the time of or prior to the acquisition honeywell is obligated to reimburse amphenol 100 of such costs honeywell representatives continue to work closely with the company in addressing the most significant environmental liabilities covered by the honeywell agreement management does not believe that the costs associated with resolution of these or any other environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition or results of operations the environmental investigation remedial and monitoring activities identified by the company including those referred to above are covered under the honeywell agreement 

  

owners and occupiers of sites containing hazardous substances as well as generators of hazardous substances are subject to broad liability under various federal and state environmental laws and regulations including expenditures for cleanup and monitoring costs and potential damages arising out of past disposal activities such liability in many cases may be imposed regardless of fault or the legality of the original disposal activity the company has performed remediation activities and is currently performing operations and maintenance and monitoring activities at three offsite disposal sites previously utilized by the company’s sidney facility and others to wit the richardson hill road landfill the route 8 landfill and the sidney landfill actions at the richardson hill road and sidney landfills were undertaken subsequent to designation as “superfund” sites on the national priorities list under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 the route 8 landfill was designated as a new york state inactive hazardous waste disposal site with remedial actions taken pursuant to chapter 6 section 3751 of the new york code of rules and regulations in addition the company is currently performing monitoring activities at and in proximity to its manufacturing site in sidney new york the company is also engaged in remediating or monitoring environmental conditions at certain of its other manufacturing facilities and has been named as a potentially responsible party for cleanup costs at other offsite disposal sites all such environmental matters referred to in this paragraph are covered by the honeywell agreement 

  

since 1987 the company has not been identified nor has it been named as a potentially responsible party with respect to any other significant onsite or offsite hazardous waste matters in addition the company believes that its manufacturing activities and disposal practices since 1987 have been in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations nonetheless it is possible that the company will be named as a potentially responsible party in the future with respect to additional superfund or other sites although the company is unable to predict with any reasonable certainty the extent of its ultimate liability with respect to any pending or future environmental matters the company believes based upon information currently known by management about the company’s manufacturing activities disposal practices and estimates of liability with respect to known environmental matters that any such liability will not be material to its financial condition or results of operations

the company is dependent on the communications industry including telecommunication and data communication wireless communications and broadband communications 

  

approximately 62 of the company’s revenues for the year ended december 31 2008 came from sales to the communications industry including telecommunication and data communication wireless communications and broadband communications demand for these products is subject to rapid technological change see below—“the company is dependent on the acceptance of new product introductions for continued revenue growth” these markets are dominated by several large manufacturers and operators who regularly exert significant price pressure on their suppliers including the company the loss of one or more of the large communications customers could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to compete successfully in the communications industry and the company’s failure to do so could have an adverse effect on the company’s results of operations 

  

approximately 10 of the company’s 2008 revenues came from sales to the broadband communications industry demand for the company’s broadband communications products depends primarily on capital spending by cable television operators for constructing rebuilding or upgrading their systems the amount of this capital spending and therefore the company’s sales and profitability will be affected by a variety of factors including general economic conditions acquisitions of cable television operators by noncable television operators cable system consolidation within the industry the financial condition of domestic cable television operators and their access to financing competition from satellite telephone and television providers and telephone companies technological developments and new legislation and regulation of cable television operators there can be no assurance that existing levels of cable television capital spending will continue or that cable television spending will not decrease 

  

changes in defense expenditures may reduce the company’s sales 

  

approximately 15 of the company’s 2008 revenues came from sales to the military market the company participates in a broad spectrum of defense programs and believes that no one program accounted for more than 1 of its 2008 revenues the substantial majority of these sales are related to both us and foreign military and defense programs however the company’s sales are generally to contractors and subcontractors of the us or foreign governments or to distributors that in turn sell to the contractors and subcontractors nevertheless the company’s sales are affected by changes in the defense budgets of the us and foreign governments a decline in us defense expenditures and defense expenditures generally could adversely affect the company’s business 

  

the company encounters competition in substantially all areas of its business 

  

the company competes primarily on the basis of technology innovation product quality price customer service and delivery time competitors include large diversified companies some of which have substantially greater assets and financial resources than the company as well as medium to small companies there can be no assurance that additional competitors will not enter the company’s existing markets nor can there be any assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against existing or new competition and the inability to do so could have an adverse effect on the company’s business and operations 

  

  

the company is dependent on the acceptance of new product introductions for continued revenue growth 

  

the company estimates that products introduced in the last two years accounted for approximately 29 of 2008 net sales the company’s longterm results of operations depend substantially upon its ability to continue to conceive design source and market new products and upon continuing market acceptance of its existing and future product lines in the ordinary course of business the company continually develops or creates new product line concepts if the company fails to or is significantly delayed in introducing new product line concepts or if the company’s new products do not meet with market acceptance our results of operations may be adversely affected 

  

covenants in the company’s credit agreements may adversely affect the company 

  

the company’s bank credit agreements contain financial and other covenants such as a limit on the ratio of debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization minimum levels of net worth and limits on incurrence of liens although the company believes none of these covenants are presently restrictive to the company’s operations the ability to meet the financial covenants can be affected by events beyond the company’s control and the company cannot provide assurance that the company will meet those tests a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the company’s credit agreements upon the occurrence of an event of default under any of the company’s credit facilities the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit if the lenders accelerate the repayment of borrowings the company may not have sufficient assets to repay the company’s credit facilities and other indebtedness see “liquidity and capital resources” 

  

downgrades of the company’s debt rating could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial position 

  

if the credit rating agencies that rate the company’s debt were to downgrade the company’s credit rating in conjunction with a deterioration of the company’s performance it may increase the company’s cost of capital and make it more difficult for the company to obtain new financing which could adversely affect the company’s business 

  

the company’s results may be negatively affected by changing interest rates 

  

the company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on the company’s financing activities the company utilizes interest rate swap agreements to manage and mitigate its exposure to changes in interest rates as of december 31 2008 the company had interest rate protection in the form of swaps that effectively fixed the company’s libor interest rate on 1500 million 2500 million and 2500 million of floating rate bank debt at 440 465 and 473 expiring in december 2009 december 2009 and july 2010 respectively 

  

a 10 change in the libor interest rate at december 31 2008 would have the effect of increasing or decreasing interest expense by approximately 02 million the company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2009 although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly change 

  

the company’s results may be negatively affected by foreign currency exchange rates 

  

the company conducts business in several international currencies through its worldwide operations and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the company’s sales gross margins and retained earnings the company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk by producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency and by managing its working capital there can be no assurance that this approach will be successful especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the company’s worldwide operations which could have an adverse effect on the results of the company’s operations 

  

the company is subject to the risks of political economic and military instability in countries outside the united states 

  

nonus markets account for a substantial portion of the company’s business during 2008 nonus markets constituted approximately 64 of the company’s net sales the company employs more than 85 of its workforce outside the united states the company’s customers are located throughout the world and it has many manufacturing administrative and sales facilities outside the united states because of the company’s extensive nonus operations it is exposed to risks that could negatively affect sales or profitability including 

  

·   tariffs trade barriers and trade disputes

·   regulations related to customs and importexport matters

  

  

·   longer payment cycles

·   tax issues such as tax law changes examinations by taxing authorities variations in tax laws from country to country as compared to the united states and difficulties in repatriating in a taxefficient manner cash generated or held abroad

the company may experience difficulties and unanticipated expense of assimilating newly acquired businesses including the potential for the impairment of goodwill 

  

the company has completed a number of acquisitions in the past few years it is possible the company may experience difficulty integrating such acquisitions and further that the acquisitions may not perform as expected at december 31 2008 the total assets of the company were 29942 million which included 12323 million of goodwill the goodwill arose as the excess of the purchase price inclusive of performancebased cash consideration over the fair value of net assets of businesses acquired the company performs annual evaluations for the potential impairment of the carrying value of goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 142 such evaluations have not resulted in the need to recognize an impairment however if the financial performance of the company’s businesses were to decline significantly the company could incur a noncash charge to its income statement for the impairment of goodwill 

  

the company may experience difficulties in obtaining a consistent supply of materials at stable pricing levels which could adversely affect its results of operations 

  

the company uses basic materials like steel aluminum copper bimetallic products gold and plastic resins in its manufacturing process volatility in the prices of such material and availability of supply may have a substantial impact on the price the company pays for such products in addition to the extent such cost increases cannot be recovered through sales price increases or productivity improvements the company’s margin may decline 

  

the company may not be able to attract and retain key employees 

  

the company’s continued success depends upon its continued ability to hire and retain key employees at its operations around the world any difficulties in obtaining or retaining the management and other human resource competencies that the company needs to achieve its business objectives may have adverse effects on the company’s performance

cash provided by operating activities totaled 4815 million 3879 million and 2896 million for 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively the increase in cash from operating activities in 2008 compared to 2007 is primarily attributable to an increase in net income an increase in depreciation and amortization and a lower increase in the components of working capital compared to the increase in 2007 the increase in cash from operating activities in 2007 compared to 2006 is primarily attributable to an increase in net income an increase in depreciation and amortization and a lower increase in the components of working capital compared to the increase in 2006 

  

the components of working capital increased 400 million in 2008 due primarily to increases in inventory of 476 million 213 million in excess tax benefits from stockbased payment arrangements and 75 million of other current assets partially offset by a 322 million increase in accrued liabilities a 27 million increase in accounts payable and a 15 million decrease in accounts receivable

in 2008 accounts receivable increased 56 million to 5160 million due primarily to acquisitions during the period partially offset by translation resulting from the comparatively stronger us dollar at december 31 2008 compared to december 31 2007 “translation” days sales outstanding increased to approximately 72 days from 69 days in 2007 inventory increased 556 million to 5125 million resulting from higher activity levels in 2008 an increase in inventory days and inventory from acquired companies of 193 million partially offset by 97 million of translation inventory days at december 31 2008 and 2007 were 88 and 80 respectively the increase in inventory days resulted primarily from a slowdown in sales activity in the fourth quarter of 2008 as a result of the well publicized global economic slowdown the company will continue to focus on inventory reduction as adjustments to production activity continue in response to lower demand levels other current assets increased 195 million to 924 million primarily due to an increase in deferred taxes land and depreciable assets net increased 283 million to 3445 million reflecting capital expenditures of 1085 million as well as assets from acquisitions of approximately 95 million offset by depreciation of 807 million 75 million due to translation and disposals of 15 million goodwill increased 1405 million to 12323 million primarily as a result of three acquisitions completed during the year the payment of and recording of liabilities for performancebased additional cash consideration of 1317 million offset by adjustments made related to prior year acquisitions and by translation of 252 million and 141 million in intangible assets reclassified to other longterm assets representing the fair value assigned to identifiable assets associated with the company’s acquisitions in 2007 other longterm assets increased 375 million to 814 million primarily due to an increase in identifiable intangible assets resulting from 2008 acquisitions as well as the reclassification from goodwill discussed above related to 2007 acquisitions and an increase in longterm deferred tax assets primarily associated with the increase in the accrued pension and postemployment obligation offset by amortization of the intangible asset balances accounts payable and accrued salaries wages and employee benefits increased 106 million and 47 million to 3060 million and 596 million respectively due primarily to liabilities assumed from acquired companies offset by translation the other accrued liabilities including acquisitionrelated obligations and accrued income taxes increased 997 million to 2688 million relating primarily to an increase of 651 million in liabilities associated with performancebased additional cash consideration on acquisitions and an increase in accrued income taxes of 262 million due primarily to an increase in liabilities related to foreign income taxes accrued pension and post employment benefit obligations increased 599 million to 1617 million primarily due to a decrease in plan assets during the year resulting from equity market losses in 2008 other longterm liabilities decreased 48 million to 622 million due primarily to lower longterm deferred tax liabilities offset by a higher minority interest liability at december 31 2008

inflation and costs 

  

the cost of the company’s products is influenced by the cost of a wide variety of raw materials including precious metals such as gold and silver used in plating aluminum copper brass and steel used for contacts shells and cable and plastic materials used in molding connector bodies inserts and cable in general increases in the cost of raw materials labor and services have been offset by price increases productivity improvements and cost saving programs 

  

risk management 

  

the company has to a significant degree mitigated its exposure to currency risk in its business operations by manufacturing and procuring its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold so that costs generally reflect local economic conditions in other cases involving us export sales raw materials are a significant component of product costs for the majority of such sales and raw material costs are generally dollar based on a worldwide scale such as basic metals and petroleumderived materials

recent accounting changes 

  

in december 2007 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 141r “business combinations” “sfas 141r” the objective of sfas 141r is to improve the relevance and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial reports about a business combination and its effects to accomplish that sfas 141r establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer 1 recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree 2 recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase and 3 determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination the areas that are most applicable to the company with regard to sfas 141r are 1 that sfas 141r requires companies to expense transaction costs as incurred 2 that any subsequent adjustments to a recorded performancebased liability after its initial recognition will need to be adjusted through income as opposed to goodwill and 3 any noncontrolling interest will be recorded at fair value sfas 141r is effective for the company for acquisitions completed on or after january 1 2009 

  

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 160 “noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements” “sfas 160” the objective of sfas 160 is to improve the relevance comparability and transparency of the financial information that a reporting entity provides in its consolidated financial statements by establishing accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary sfas 160 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning on or after december 15 2008 sfas 160 shall be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which it is initially applied except for the presentation and disclosure requirements the 

  

  

presentation and disclosure requirements apply retrospectively for all periods presented the areas that are most applicable to the company with regard to sfas 160 are 1 sfas 160 requires companies to classify expense related to noncontrolling interests’ share in income below net income earnings per share will still be determined after the impact of noncontrolling interests’ share in net income of the company as is the current practice during the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 the company included expense related to the noncontrolling interests’ share in income of 104 million and 105 million respectively in other expenses net and 2 sfas 160 requires the liability related to noncontrolling interests to be presented as a separate caption within shareholders’ equity as of december 31 2008 and 2007 the liability related to noncontrolling interests was 191 million and 148 million respectively and is included in other longterm liabilities the company believes the primary impacts of sfas 160 will be as described above 

  

in march 2008 the fasb issued sfas no 161 “disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities” “sfas 161” sfas 161 amends and expands the disclosure requirements of sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” “sfas 133” with the intent to provide users of financial statements with an enhanced understanding of 1 how and why an entity uses derivative instruments 2 how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under sfas 133 and its related interpretations and 3 how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position financial performance and cash flows to meet those objectives sfas 161 requires qualitative disclosures about objectives and strategies for using derivatives quantitative disclosures about fair value amounts of and gains and losses on derivative instruments and disclosures about creditriskrelated contingent features in derivative agreements sfas 161 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december 15 2008 the company does not believe this pronouncement will significantly impact its disclosure requirements 

  

pensions 

  

the company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries have a defined benefit pension plan “us plan” covering certain of its us employees us plan benefits are generally based on years of service and compensation and are generally noncontributory certain foreign subsidiaries also have defined benefit plans covering employees the pension expense for all pension plans approximated 120 million 160 million and 170 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively and is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions established on january 1 of the applicable year including an expected longterm rate of return on the us plan assets in developing the expected longterm rate of return assumption for the us plan the company evaluated input from its external actuaries and investment consultants as well as longterm inflation assumptions projected returns by such consultants are based on broad equity and bond indices the company also considered its historical nineteenyear compounded return of 85 which has been in excess of these broad equity and bond benchmark indices the expected longterm rate of return on the us plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of 60 with equity managers with an expected longterm rate of return of 9 25 with fixed income managers with an expected longterm rate of return of 68 and 15 with high yield bond managers with an expected rate of return of 6 as of december 31 2008 the asset allocation was 45 with equity managers and 37 with fixed income managers including high yield managers and 18 in cash the company believes that the longterm asset allocation on average will approximate 60 with equity managers and 40 with fixed income managers the company regularly reviews the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances investments to its targeted allocation when considered appropriate based on this methodology the company’s expected longterm rate of return assumption to determine the accrued benefit obligation of the us plan at december 31 2008 and 2007 is 825 and 925 respectively this reduction in the longterm rate of return will have the effect of increasing 2009 pension expense by approximately 24 million 

  

the discount rate used by the company for valuing pension liabilities is based on a review of high quality corporate bond yields with maturities approximating the remaining life of the projected benefit obligations the discount rate for the us plan on this basis was 625 at both december 31 2008 and 2007 although future changes to the discount rate are unknown had the discount rate increased or decreased 50 basis points the accrued benefit obligation would have increased or decreased by approximately 155 million 

  

effective january 1 2007 the company effected a curtailment related to the us plan which resulted in no additional benefits being credited to salaried employees who had less than 25 years service with the company or who had not attained age 50 and who had less than 15 years of service with the company this change had the impact of decreasing pension expense during 2007 by approximately 29 million for affected employees the curtailment in additional us plan benefits was replaced with a company match defined contribution plan to which the company contributed approximately 19 million and 17 million in 2008 and 2007 respectively 

  

the company made cash contributions to the us plan of 20 million in both 2008 and 2007 the liability for accrued pension and postemployment benefit obligations under all the company’s pension and postretirement benefit plans the “plans” increased in 2008 to 1659 million 42 million of which is included in other accrued expenses representing required contributions to be 

  

  

made during 2009 for foreign plans from 1018 million in 2007 primarily due to a reduction in plan assets in the us plan offset by the cash contributions made to the plans in 2008 and by the foreign currency translation effect of the foreign pension plans the company estimates that based on current actuarial calculations it will make a voluntary cash contribution to the us plan in 2009 of approximately 15 million to 20 million cash contributions in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors including the investment performance of the us plan assets and the impact of the pension protection act of 2006 which was signed into law in august 2006 the pension protection act is effective for plan years beginning in 2008 and did not have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates estimates are adjusted as new information becomes available the company’s significant accounting policies are set forth below 

  

revenue recognition  the company’s primary source of revenues is from product sales to its customers revenue from sales of the company’s products is recognized at the time the goods are delivered and title passes provided the earning process is complete and revenue is measurable delivery is determined by the company’s shipping terms which are primarily fob shipping point revenue is recorded at the net amount to be received after deductions for estimated discounts allowances and returns these estimates and reserves are determined and adjusted as needed based upon historical experience contract terms and other related factors the shipping costs for the majority of the company’s sales are paid directly by the company’s customers in the broadband communication market approximately 10 of consolidated sales the company pays for shipping cost to the majority of its customers shipping costs are also paid by the company for certain customers in the interconnect products and assemblies market amounts billed to customers related to shipping costs are immaterial and are included in net sales shipping costs incurred to transport products to the customer which are not reimbursed are included in selling general and administrative expense 

  

inventories  inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost which approximates average cost or market provisions for slowmoving and obsolete inventory are made based on historical experience and product demand should future product demand change existing inventory could become slowmoving or obsolete and provisions would be increased accordingly 

  

depreciable assets  property plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation the appropriateness and the recoverability of the carrying value of such assets are periodically reviewed taking into consideration current and expected business conditions historically the company has not had any significant impairments 

  

goodwill  the company performs its annual evaluation for the impairment of goodwill for the company’s reporting units in accordance with sfas no 142 as of each june 30 goodwill impairment for each reporting unit is evaluated using a twostep approach requiring the company to determine the fair value of the reporting unit and to compare that to the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill if the carrying value exceeded the fair value the goodwill of the reporting unit would be potentially impaired and a second step of additional testing would be performed to measure the impairment loss historically the company has not had any impairments 

  

defined benefit plan obligation – the defined benefit plan obligation is based on significant assumptions such as mortality rates discount rates and plan asset rates of return as determined by the company in consultation with the respective benefit plan actuaries and investment advisors 

  

the significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 to the company’s consolidated financial statements 

  

  

disclosures about contractual obligations and commitments 

  

the following table summarizes the company’s known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of december 31 2008 as well as an estimate of the timing in which such obligations are expected to be satisfied 

  

   

1 the company has excluded expected interest payments from the above table as this calculation is largely dependent on average debt levels the company expects to have at the end of each of the years presented as well as the expected interest rates on the debt not covered by interest rate swaps the actual interest payments made in 2008 were 39180 expected debt levels and therefore expected interest payments are difficult to predict as they are significantly impacted by such items as future acquisitions repurchases of treasury stock dividend payments as well as payments or additional borrowing made to reduce or increase the underlying revolver balance 

2 accrued acquisitionrelated obligations consist of obligations for additional purchase price and performancebased cash consideration 

3 included in this table are estimated benefit payments expected to be made under the company’s unfunded pension and postretirement benefit plans the company also maintains several funded pension and postretirement benefit plans the most significant of which covers its us employees over the past several years there has been no minimum requirement for company contributions to the us plan due to prior contributions made in excess of minimum requirements but the company has made contributions to the us plan in the range of 15000 to 20000 in each of the last few years and expects to make this same level of contribution in 2009 as a result it is not possible to reasonably estimate expected required contributions in the above table since several assumptions are required to calculate the minimum required contributions such as the discount rate and expected asset returns 

4 as of december 31 2008 the company has fasb interpretation no 48 liabilities of 38058 due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with the noncurrent fin 48 liabilities it is very difficult to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these noncurrent liabilities might be paid 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

the company in the normal course of doing business is exposed to the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 

  

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

  

the company conducts business in several international currencies through its worldwide operations and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the company’s sales gross margins and retained earnings the company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk by producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency and by managing its working capital although there can be no assurance that this approach will be successful especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the company’s worldwide operations the company does not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes 

  

interest rate risk 

  

as of december 31 2008 the company had interest rate swap agreements that fix the company’s libor interest rate on 1500 million 2500 million and 2500 million of floating rate bank debt at 440 465 and 473 expiring in december 2009 december 2009 and july 2010 at december 31 2008 the company’s average libor rate was 409 a 10 change in the libor interest rate at december 31 2008 would have the effect of increasing or decreasing interest expense by approximately 02 million the company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2009 although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly change

environmental matters 

certain operations of the company are subject to federal state and local environmental laws and regulations which govern the discharge of pollutants into the air and water as well as the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes the company believes that its operations are currently in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations and that the costs of continuing compliance will not have a material effect on the companys financial condition or results of operations 

subsequent to the acquisition of amphenol from allied signal corporation “allied signal” in 1987 allied signal merged with honeywell international inc in december 1999 honeywell amphenol and honeywell were named jointly and severally liable as potentially responsible parties in relation to several environmental cleanup sites amphenol and honeywell jointly consented to perform certain investigations and remedial and monitoring activities at two sites the “route 8” landfill and the “richardson hill road” landfill and they were jointly ordered to perform work at another site the “sidney” landfill the costs incurred relating to these three sites are currently reimbursed by honeywell based on an agreement the “honeywell agreement” entered into in connection with the acquisition in 1987 for sites covered by the honeywell agreement to the extent that conditions or circumstances occurred or existed at the time of or prior to the acquisition honeywell is obligated to reimburse amphenol 100 of such costs honeywell representatives continue to work closely with the company in addressing the most significant environmental liabilities covered by the honeywell agreement management does not believe that the costs associated with resolution of these or any other environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition or results of operations the environmental investigation remedial and monitoring activities identified by the company including those referred to above are covered under the honeywell agreement 

  

  

owners and occupiers of sites containing hazardous substances as well as generators of hazardous substances are subject to broad liability under various federal and state environmental laws and regulations including expenditures for cleanup and monitoring costs and potential damages arising out of past disposal activities such liability in many cases may be imposed regardless of fault or the legality of the original disposal activity the company has performed remediation activities and is currently performing operations and maintenance and monitoring activities at three offsite disposal sites previously utilized by the company’s sidney facility and others to wit the richardson hill road landfill the route 8 landfill and the sidney landfill actions at the richardson hill road and sidney landfills were undertaken subsequent to designation as superfund sites on the national priorities list under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 the route 8 landfill was designated as a new york state inactive hazardous waste disposal site with remedial actions taken pursuant to chapter 6 section 3751 of the new york code of rules and regulations in addition the company is currently performing monitoring activities at and in proximity to its manufacturing site in sidney new york the company is also engaged in remediating or monitoring environmental conditions at certain of its other manufacturing facilities and has been named as a potentially responsible party for cleanup costs at other offsite disposal sites all such environmental matters referred to in this paragraph are covered by the honeywell agreement 

since 1987 the company has not been identified nor has it been named as a potentially responsible party with respect to any other significant onsite or offsite hazardous waste matters in addition the company believes that all of its manufacturing activities and disposal practices since 1987 have been in material compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations nonetheless it is possible that the company will be named as a potentially responsible party in the future with respect to additional superfund or other sites although the company is unable to predict with any reasonable certainty the extent of its ultimate liability with respect to any pending or future environmental matters the company believes based upon all information currently known by management about the companys manufacturing activities disposal practices and estimates of liability with respect to all known environmental matters that any such liability will not be material to its financial condition or results of operations

cautionary statements for purposes of forward looking information 

statements made by the company in written or oral form to various persons including statements made in filings with the sec that are not strictly historical facts are forward looking statements such statements should be considered as subject to uncertainties that exist in the companys operations and business environment the following includes some but not all of the factors or uncertainties that could cause the company to fail to conform with expectations and predictions 

  




 item 1a risk factors 

investors should carefully consider the risks described below and all other information in this form 10k the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the company additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the company or that it currently deems immaterial may also impair the company’s business and operations 

if any of the following risks actually occur the company’s business financial condition andor results of operations could be materially adversely affected in such case the trading price of the company’s common stock could decline and investors may lose all or part of their investment 

the company is dependent on the communications industry including telecommunication and data communication wireless communications and broadband communications 

approximately 60 of the company’s revenues for the year ended december 31 2007 came from sales to the communications industry including telecommunication and data communication wireless communications and broadband communications demand for these products is subject to rapid technological change see below—”the company is dependent on the acceptance of new product introductions for continued revenue growth” these markets are dominated by several large manufacturers and operators who regularly exert significant price pressure on their suppliers including the company while sales to the company’s largest customer accounted for approximately 7 of consolidated sales in 2007 the loss of one or more of the large communications customers could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to compete successfully in the communications industry and the company’s failure to do so could impair the company’s results of operations 

approximately 10 of the company’s 2007 revenues came from sales to the broadband communications industry demand for the company’s broadband communications products depends primarily on capital spending by cable television operators for constructing rebuilding or upgrading their systems the amount of this capital spending and therefore the company’s sales and profitability will be affected by a variety of factors including general economic conditions acquisitions of cable television operators by noncable television operators cable system consolidation within the industry the financial condition of domestic cable television operators and their access to financing competition from satellite telephone and television providers and telephone companies technological developments and new legislation and regulation of cable television operators there can be no assurance that existing levels of cable television capital spending will continue or that cable television spending will not decrease 

changes in defense expenditures may reduce the company’s sales 

approximately 15 of the company’s 2007 revenues came from sales to the military market the company participates in a broad spectrum of defense programs and believes that no one program accounted for more than 1 of its 2007 revenues the substantial majority of these sales are related to both us and foreign military and defense programs however the company’s sales are generally to contractors and subcontractors of the us or foreign governments or to distributors that in turn sell to the contractors and subcontractors nevertheless the company’s sales are affected by changes in the defense budgets of the us and foreign governments the us defense budget declined in real terms from 1986 to 1998 beginning in 1999 the us defense budget has been increasing and increased again in 2007 nevertheless a decline in us defense expenditures and defense expenditures generally could adversely affect the company’s business 

the company encounters competition in substantially all areas of its business 

the company competes primarily on the basis of engineering product quality price customer service and delivery time competitors include large diversified companies some of which have substantially greater assets and financial resources than the company as well as medium to small companies there can be no assurance that additional competitors will not enter the company’s existing markets nor can there be any assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against existing or new competition 

  

the company is dependent on the acceptance of new product introductions for continued revenue growth 

the company estimates that products introduced in the last two years accounted for approximately 26 of 2007 net sales the company’s longterm results of operations depend substantially upon its ability to continue to conceive design source and market new products and upon continuing market acceptance of its existing and future product lines in the ordinary course of business the company continually develops or creates new product line concepts if the company fails or is significantly delayed in introducing new product line concepts or if the company’s new products do not meet with market acceptance our results of operations may be impaired 

covenants in the company’s credit agreements may adversely affect the company 

the company’s bank credit agreements contain financial and other covenants such as a limit on the ratio of debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization minimum levels of net worth and limits on incurrence of liens although the company believes none of these covenants are presently restrictive to the company’s operations the ability to meet the financial covenants can be affected by events beyond the company’s control and the company cannot provide assurance that the company will meet those tests a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the company’s credit agreements upon the occurrence of an event of default under any of the company’s credit facilities the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit if the lenders accelerate the repayment of borrowings the company cannot provide assurance that it will have sufficient assets to repay the company’s credit facilities and other indebtedness see “liquidity and capital resources” 

downgrades of the company’s debt rating could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial possition 

if the credit rating agencies that rate the company’s debt were to downgrade the company’s credit rating in conjunction with a deterioration of the company’s performance it may increase the company’s cost of capital and make it more difficult for the company to obtain new financing 

the company’s results may be negatively affected by changing interest rates  

the company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on the company’s financing activities the company utilizes interest rate swap agreements to manage and mitigate its exposure to changes in interest rates as of december 31 2007 the company had interest rate protection in the form of swaps that effectively fixed the company’s libor interest rate on 2500 million 2500 million and 1500 million of floating rate bank debt at 424 485 and 440 expiring in july 2008 december 2008 and december 2009 respectively 

in october 2007 the company entered into interest rate swaps that fix the company’s libor interest rate on 2500 million and 2500 million of floating rate bank debt at 473 and 465 which go into effect in july 2008 and december 2008 and expire in july 2010 and december 2009 respectively a 10 change in the libor interest rate at december 31 2007 would have the effect of increasing or decreasing interest expense by approximately 3 million the company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2008 although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly change 

the company’s results may be negatively affected by foreign currency exchange rates 

the company conducts business in several international currencies through its worldwide operations and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the company’s sales gross margins and retained earnings the company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk by producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency and by managing its working capital there can be no assurance that this approach will be successful especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the company’s worldwide operations the company does not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes 

  

  

the company’s operating results may be adversely affected by foreign operations 

  

international manufacturing and sales are subject to inherent risks including changes in local economic or political conditions the imposition of currency exchange restrictions unexpected changes in regulatory environments potentially adverse tax consequences and the exchange rate risk discussed above there can be no assurance that these factors will not have a material adverse impact on the company’s production capabilities or otherwise adversely affect the company’s business and operating results 

  

the company may experience difficulties and unanticipated expense including the potential for the impairment of goodwill of assimilating newly acquired businesses 

  

the company has completed a number of acquisitions in the past few years it is possible the company may experience difficulty integrating such acquisitions and further that the acquisitions may not perform as expected at december 31 2007 the total assets on the company’s balance sheet were 26757 million which included 10918 million of goodwill the goodwill arose as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets of businesses acquired over the period 19872007 the company performs annual evaluations for the potential impairment of the carrying value of goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 142 such evaluations have not resulted in the need to recognize an impairment however if the financial performance of the company’s businesses were to decline significantly the company could incur a noncash charge to its income statement for the impairment of goodwill 

  

the company may experience difficulties in obtaining a consistent supply of materials at stable pricing levels 

  

the company uses basic materials like steel aluminum copper bimetallic products gold and plastic resins in its manufacturing process volatility in the prices of such material and availability of supply may have a substantial impact on the price the company pays for such products in addition to the extent such cost increases cannot be recovered through sales price increases or productivity improvements the company’s margin may decline 

  

the company may not be able to attract and retain key employees 

  

the company’s continued success depends upon its continued ability to hire and retain key employees at its operations around the world any difficulties in obtaining or retaining the management and other human resource competencies that the company needs to achieve its business objectives may have adverse affects on the company’s performance 

  

changes in general economic conditions and other factors beyond the company’s control may adversely impact its business 

  

the following factors could adversely impact the company’s business 

  

·   a global economic slowdown in any one or all of the company’s market segments 

  

·   the effects of significant changes in monetary and fiscal policies in the us and abroad including significant income tax changes currency fluctuations and unforeseen inflationary pressures

the cost of the company’s products is influenced by the cost of a wide variety of raw materials including precious metals such as gold and silver used in plating aluminum copper brass and steel used for contacts shells and cable and plastic materials used in molding connector bodies inserts and cable in general increases in the cost of raw materials labor and services have been offset by price increases productivity improvements and cost saving programs 

  

risk management 

  

the company has to a significant degree mitigated its exposure to currency risk in its business operations by manufacturing and procuring its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold so that costs reflect local economic conditions in other cases involving us export sales raw materials are a significant component of product costs for the majority of such sales and raw material costs are generally dollar based on a worldwide scale such as basic metals and petroleumderived materials 

  

stock split 

  

on january 17 2007 the company announced a 2for1 stock split that was effective for stockholders of record as of march 16 2007 and these additional shares were distributed on march 30 2007 the share information included herein reflects the effect of such stock split 

  

recent accounting changes 

  

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” “sfas 157” sfas 157 provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities it also responds to investors’ requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value the information used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings sfas 157 applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value and does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances sfas 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2008 as a result of fasb staff position 1572 issued in february 2008 and is required to be adopted by the company in the first quarter of 2009 the company does not believe sfas 157 will have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition 

  

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities” “sfas 159” this statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value the objective is to provide entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions sfas 159 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 the company does not believe sfas 159 will have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition 

  

  

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141r “business combinations” “sfas 141r” the objective of this statement is to improve the relevance representational faithfulness and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial reports about a business combination and its effects to accomplish that this statement establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer 1 recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree 2 recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase and 3 determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination this statement applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december 15 2008 the areas that are most applicable to the company with regard to this statement are 1 that the statement requires companies to expense transaction costs as incurred 2 that any subsequent adjustments to a recorded performancebased liability after its initial recognition will need to be adjusted through income as opposed to goodwill and 3 any liabilities related to noncontrolling interest will be recorded at fair value the company is currently evaluating the effect of this statement to determine the impact it will have but believes the impact will not be material to its consolidated results of operations and financial condition 

  

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 160 “noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements” the objective of this statement is to improve the relevance comparability and transparency of the financial information that a reporting entity provides in its consolidated financial statements by establishing accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary this statement is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning on or after december 15 2008 this statement shall be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which this statement is initially applied except for the presentation and disclosure requirements which shall be applied retrospectively for all periods presented the areas that are most applicable to the company with regard to this statement are 1 the statement requires companies to classify expense related to noncontrolling interest’s share in income below net income earnings per share will still be determined after the impact of noncontrolling interest’s share in net income of the company as is current practice during 2007 2006 and 2005 the company included expense related to the noncontrolling interests share in income of 105 million 60 million and 41 million respectively in other expenses net and 2 this statement requires the liability related to noncontrolling interests to be presented as a separate caption within shareholders’ equity as of december 31 2007 and 2006 the liability related to noncontrolling interests was 148 million and 187 million respectively and is included in other longterm liabilities the company is currently evaluating the effect of this statement to determine the impact it will have but believes the primary impact will be as described above 

  

pensions 

  

the company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries have a defined benefit pension plan “us plan” covering their us employees us plan benefits are generally based on years of service and compensation and are generally noncontributory certain foreign subsidiaries also have defined benefit plans covering their employees the pension expense for all pension plans approximated 160 million 170 million and 135 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively and is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions established on january 1 of the applicable year including an expected longterm rate of return on the us plan assets in developing the expected longterm rate of return assumption for the us plan the company evaluated input from its actuaries and investment consultants as well as longterm inflation assumptions projected returns by such consultants are based on broad equity and bond indices the company also considered its historical eighteenyear compounded return of 114 which has been in excess of these broad equity and bond benchmark indices the expected longterm rate of return on the us plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of 60 with equity managers with an expected longterm rate of return of 1065 25 with fixed income managers with an expected longterm rate of return of 675 and 15 with high yield bond managers with an expected rate of return of 8 as of december 31 2007 the asset allocation was 62 with equity managers and 31 with fixed income managers including high yield managers and 7 in cash the company believes that the longterm asset allocation on average will approximate 60 with equity managers and 40 with fixed income managers the company regularly reviews the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances investments to its targeted allocation when considered appropriate based on this methodology the company’s expected longterm rate of return assumption to determine the accrued benefit obligation of the us plan at december 31 2007 and 2006 is 925 and 95 respectively 

  

the discount rate used by the company for valuing pension liabilities is based on a review of high quality corporate bond yields with maturities approximating the remaining life of the projected benefit obligations the discount rate for the us plan on this basis has increased from 575 at december 31 2006 to 625 at december 31 2007 this will have the effect of decreasing pension expense in 2008 by approximately 22 million although future changes to the discount rate are unknown had the discount rate increased or decreased 50 basis points the accrued benefit obligation would have decreased 144 million or increased 150 million respectively 

  

  

effective january 1 2007 the company effected a curtailment related to the us plan which resulted in no additional benefits being credited to salaried employees who had less than 25 years service with the company or who had not attained age 50 and who had less than 15 years of service with the company this change had the impact of decreasing the unfunded pension liability by 51 million at december 31 2006 and had the effect of decreasing pension expense during 2007 by approximately 29 million for affected employees the curtailment in additional us plan benefits was replaced with a company match defined contribution plan to which the company contributed approximately 17 million in 2007 

  

in september 2006 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued sfas 158 which requires employers to fully recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its balance sheet the pension asset or liability under sfas 158 is equal to the difference between the fair value of the plan’s assets and its projected benefit obligation for pension plans and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for other postretirement plans prior guidance required the liability to be measured as the accumulated benefit obligation in addition this statement requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its yearend balance sheet with limited exceptions sfas 158 also requires entities to disclose in the notes to financial statements additional information about certain effects on net periodic benefit cost for the next fiscal year that arise from delayed recognition of the gains or losses prior service costs or credits and transition asset or obligation the statement was effective for years ending after december 15 2006 except for the requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the employer’s fiscal yearend balance sheet which is effective for fiscal years ending after december 15 2008 sfas 158 had the effect of increasing the company’s accrued benefit obligation and other comprehensive income net of deferred tax assets by approximately 311 million and 192 million respectively at december 31 2006 and did not have any impact on the company’s consolidated statement of income 

  

the company made cash contributions to the us plan of 20 million and 15 million in 2007 and 2006 respectively the liability for accrued pension and post employment benefit obligations under all the company’s pension and postretirement benefit plans the “plans” decreased in 2007 to 1018 million from 1383 million in 2006 primarily due to the cash contributions made to the plans in 2007 as well as the higher discount rate assumptions used to calculate the projected benefit obligation at december 31 2007 offset by the foreign currency translation effect of the foreign pension plans the company estimates that based on current actuarial calculations it will make a voluntary cash contribution to the us plan in 2008 of approximately 100 to 200 million cash contributions in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors including the investment performance of the us plan assets and the impact of the pension protection act of 2006 which was signed into law in august 2006 the intent of the legislation is to require companies to fund 100 of their pension liability and then for companies to fund on a goingforward basis an amount generally estimated to be the amount that the pension liability increases each year due to an additional year of service by the employees eligible for pension benefits the legislation requires that funding shortfalls be eliminated by companies over a sevenyear period beginning in 2008 the pension protection act also extended the provisions of the pension funding equity act that would have expired in 2006 had the pension protection act not been enacted which increased the allowed discount rate used to calculate the pension liability the pension protection act is effective for plan years beginning after 2007 and the company does not believe it will have a material impact on its consolidated results 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates estimates are adjusted as new information becomes available the company’s significant accounting policies are set forth below 

  

revenue recognition  the company’s primary source of revenues is from product sales to its customers revenue from sales of the company’s products is recognized at the time the goods are delivered and title passes provided the earning process is complete and revenue is measurable delivery is determined by the company’s shipping terms which are primarily fob shipping point revenue is recorded at the net amount to be received after deductions for estimated discounts allowances and returns these estimates and reserves are determined and adjusted as needed based upon historical experience contract terms and other related factors the shipping costs for the majority of the company’s sales are paid directly by the company’s customers in the broadband communication market approximately 10 of consolidated sales the company pays for shipping cost to the majority of its customers shipping costs are also paid by the company for certain customers in the interconnect products and assemblies market amounts billed to customers related to shipping costs are immaterial and are included in net sales shipping costs incurred to transport products to the customer which are not reimbursed are included in selling general and administrative expense 

  

  

inventories  inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost which approximates average cost or market provisions for slow moving and obsolete inventory are made based on historical experience and product demand should future product demand change existing inventory could become slow moving or obsolete and provisions would be increased accordingly 

  

depreciable assets  property plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation the appropriateness and the recoverability of the carrying value of such assets are periodically reviewed taking into consideration current and expected business conditions historically the company has not had any significant impairments 

  

goodwill  the company performs its annual evaluation for the impairment of goodwill for the company’s reporting units in accordance with sfas no 142 as of each june 30 goodwill impairment for each reporting unit is evaluated using a twostep approach requiring the company to determine the fair value of the reporting unit and compare that to the carrying value including goodwill if the carrying value exceeded the fair value the goodwill of the reporting unit would be potentially impaired and a second step of additional testing would be performed to measure the impairment loss historically the company has not had any impairments 

  

defined benefit plan obligation — the defined benefit plan obligation is based on significant assumptions such as mortality rates discount rates and plan asset rates of return as determined by the company in consultation with the respective benefit plan actuaries and investment advisors 

  

the significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 to the company’s consolidated financial statements 

  

disclosures about contractual obligations and commitments 

  

the following table summarizes the company’s known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of december 31 2007 as well as an estimate of the timing in which such obligations are expected to be satisfied 

  

   

1   the company has excluded expected interest payments from the above table as this calculation is largely dependent on average debt levels the company expects to have at the end of each of the years presented as well as the expected interest rates on the debt not covered by interest rate swaps the actual interest payments made in 2007 were 36238 expected debt levels and therefore expected interest payments are difficult to predict as they are significantly impacted by such items as future acquisitions repurchases of treasury stock dividend payments as well as payments or additional borrowing made to reduce or increase the underlying revolver balance 

2   accrued acquisitionrelated obligations consist of obligations for additional purchase price and performancebased cash consideration 

3   included in this table are estimated benefit payments expected to be made under the company’s unfunded pension and post retirement benefit plans the company also maintains several funded pension and post retirement benefit plans the most significant of which covers its us employees over the past several years there has been no minimum requirement for company contributions to the us plan due to prior contributions made in excess of minimum requirements but the company has made contributions to the us plan in the range of 10000 to 20000 in each of the last few years and expects to make this same level of contribution in 2008 as a result it is not possible to reasonably estimate expected required contributions in the above table since several assumptions are required to calculate the minimum required contributions such as the discount rate and expected asset returns 

4   as of december 31 2007 the company has fin 48 liabilities of 33037 due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with the noncurrent fin 48 liabilities it is very difficult to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these noncurrent liabilities might be paid 

  

  




 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

the company in the normal course of doing business is exposed to the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 

  

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

  

the company conducts business in several international currencies through its worldwide operations and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the company’s sales gross margins and retained earnings the company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk by producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency and by managing its working capital although there can be no assurance that this approach will be successful especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the company’s worldwide operations the company does not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes 

  

interest rate risk 

  

relative to interest rate risk the company entered into interest rate swap agreements that fixed the company’s libor interest rate on 2500 million 2500 million and 1500 million of floating rate bank debt at 424 485 and 440 expiring in july 2008 december 2008 and december 2009 respectively at december 31 2007 the company’s average libor rate was 456 in october 2007 the company entered into interest rate swaps that fix the company’s libor interest rate on 2500 million and 2500 million of floating rate bank debt at 473 and 465 which go into effect in july 2008 and december 2008 and expire in july 2010 and december 2009 respectively a 10 change in the libor interest rate at december 31 2007 would have had the effect of increasing or decreasing interest expense by approximately 3 million the company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2008 although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly change

general 

amphenol corporation “amphenol” or the “company” is one of the world’s largest designers manufacturers and marketers of electrical electronic and fiber optic connectors interconnect systems and coaxial and flatribbon cable the company was incorporated in 1987 certain predecessor businesses which now constitute part of the company have been in business since 1932 the primary end markets for the company’s products are 

·   communication systems for the converging technologies of voice video and data communications

·   a broad range of industrial applications including factory automation and motion control systems medical and industrial instrumentation mass transportation and natural resource exploration and automotive applications and

·   commercial aerospace and military applications

the company’s strategy is to provide its customers with comprehensive design capabilities a broad selection of products and a high level of service on a worldwide basis while maintaining continuing programs of productivity improvement and cost control for 2006 the company reported net sales operating income and net income of 24714 million 4246 million and 2557 million respectively the table below summarizes information regarding the company’s primary markets and end applications for the company’s products 

 

  

  

the company designs and manufactures connectors and interconnect systems which are used primarily to conduct electrical and optical signals for a wide range of sophisticated electronic applications the company believes based primarily on published market research that it is the third largest connector manufacturer in the world the company has developed a broad range of connector and interconnect products for the information technology and communications equipment applications including the converging voice video and data communications markets the company offers a broad range of interconnect products for factory automation machine tools instrumentation and medical systems mass transportation applications and automotive applications including airbags pretensioner seatbelts and other on board automotive electronics in addition the company is the leading supplier of high performance militaryspecification circular environmental connectors that require superior reliability and performance under conditions of stress and in hostile environments these conditions are frequently encountered in commercial and military aerospace applications and other demanding industrial applications such as oil exploration medical instrumentation and offroad construction 

the company is a global manufacturer employing advanced manufacturing processes the company designs manufactures and assembles its products at facilities in the americas europe africa and asia the company sells its products through its own global sales force and independent manufacturers’ representatives and a global network of electronics distributors to thousands of oems in approximately 60 countries throughout the world the company also sells certain products to electronic manufacturing services ems and original design manufacturing odm companies and to communication network operators for the year 2006 approximately 47 of the company’s net sales were in north america 21 were in europe and 32 were in asia and other countries 

the company generally implements its product development strategy through product design teams and collaboration arrangements with customers which result in the company obtaining approved vendor status for its customers’ new products and programs the company seeks to have its products become widely accepted within the industry for similar applications and products manufactured by other potential customers which the company believes will provide additional sources of future revenue by developing application specific products the company has decreased its exposure to standard products which generally experience greater pricing pressure in addition to product design teams and customer collaboration arrangements the company uses key account managers to manage customer relationships on a global basis such that it can bring to bear its total resources to meet the worldwide needs of its multinational customers 

the company and industry analysts estimate that the worldwide sales of interconnect products were approximately 40 billion in 2006 the company believes that the worldwide industry for interconnect products and systems is highly fragmented with over 2000 producers of connectors and interconnect systems worldwide of which the 10 largest including amphenol accounted for a combined market share of approximately 53 in 2006 

the company’s acquisition strategy is focused on the consolidation of this highly fragmented industry the company targets acquisitions on a global basis in high growth segments that have complementary capabilities to the company from a product customer or geographic standpoint the company looks to add value to those smaller companies through its global capabilities and generally expects acquisitions to be accretive to performance in the first year in the year 2006 the company spent approximately 22 million on acquisitions including payments for performancebased additional cash consideration this represented two small acquisitions in target markets including the data communications and industrialmedical markets that broadened and enhanced its product offering in these areas in december 2005 the company purchased the connection systems business “tcs” of teradyne inc for approximately 385 million tcs had sales of approximately 373 million in 2005 and the company believes is the leader in high speed high density printed circuit board interconnect products tcs sells its products primarily to the data communications wireless infrastructure and storage and server markets the tcs acquisition is almost entirely complementary to amphenol from a product standpoint and allows the company to offer a complete and integrated interconnect solution for customers in the communications markets significantly enhancing the company’s position 

business segments 

the following table sets forth the dollar amounts of the company’s net trade sales for its business segments for a discussion of factors affecting changes in sales by business segment and additional segment financial data see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 9 in the company’s “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

   

1   based on customer location to which product is shipped 

interconnect products and assemblies the company produces a broad range of interconnect products and assemblies primarily for voice video and data communication systems commercial aerospace and military systems automotive and mass transportation applications and industrial and factory automation equipment interconnect products include connectors which when attached to an electronic or fiber optic cable a printed circuit board or other device facilitate electronic or fiber optic transmission interconnect assemblies generally consist of a system of cable and connectors for linking electronic and fiber optic equipment the company designs and produces a broad range of connector and cable assembly products used in communication applications such as engineered cable assemblies used in base stations for wireless communication systems and internet networking equipment smart card acceptor devices used in mobile telephones set top boxes and other applications to facilitate reading data from smart cards fiber optic connectors used in fiber optic signal transmission backplane and inputoutput connectors and assemblies used for servers and data storage devices and linking personal computers and peripheral equipment sculptured flexible circuits used for integrating printed circuit boards in communication applications and hinge products used in mobile phone and other mobile communication devices the company also designs and produces a broad range of radio frequency connector products and antennas used in telecommunications computer and office equipment instrumentation equipment local area networks and automotive electronics the company’s radio frequency interconnect products and assemblies are also used in base stations mobile communication devices and other components of cellular and personal communications networks 

the company believes that it is the largest supplier of high performance militaryspecification circular environmental connectors such connectors require superior performance and reliability under conditions of stress and in hostile environments high performance environmental connectors and interconnect systems are generally used to interconnect electronic and fiber optic systems in sophisticated aerospace military commercial and industrial equipment these applications present demanding technological requirements in that the connectors are subject to rapid and severe temperature changes vibration humidity and nuclear radiation frequent applications of these connectors and interconnect systems include aircraft guided missiles radar military vehicles equipment for spacecraft energy medical instrumentation geophysical applications and offroad construction equipment the company also designs and produces industrial interconnect products used in a variety of applications such as factory automation equipment mass transportation applications including railroads and marine transportation and automotive safety products including interconnect devices and systems used in automotive airbags pretensioner seatbelts antilock braking systems and other on board automotive electronic systems the company also designs and produces highlyengineered cable and backplane assemblies such assemblies are specially designed by the company in conjunction with oem customers for specific applications primarily for computer wired and wireless communication systems office equipment and aerospace applications the cable assemblies utilize the company’s connector and cable products as well as components purchased from others 

cable products the company designs manufactures and markets coaxial cable primarily for use in the cable television industry the company’s times fiber communications subsidiary is the world’s second largest producer of coaxial cable for the cable television market the company believes that its times fiber communications unit is one of the lowest cost producers of coaxial cable for cable television the company’s coaxial cable and connector products are used in cable television systems including full service cable television telecommunication systems being installed by cable operators and telecommunication companies offering video voice and data services the company is also a major supplier of coaxial cable to the international cable television market the company manufactures two primary types of coaxial cable semiflexible which has an aluminum tubular shield and flexible which has one or more braided metallic shields semiflexible coaxial cable is used in the trunk and feeder distribution portion of cable television systems and flexible cable also known as drop cable is used primarily for hookups from the feeder cable to the cable television subscriber’s residence flexible cable is also used in other communication applications the company has also developed a broad line of radio frequency and fiber optic interconnect components for full service cable television telecommunication networks 

the rapid development in fiber optic technologies digital compression which allows multiple channels to be transmitted within the same bandwidth that a single analog channel requires and other communication technologies including the company’s development of higher capacity coaxial cable have resulted in technologies that enable cable television systems to provide channel capacity in excess of 500 channels such expanded channel capacity along with other component additions permit cable operators to offer full service networks with a variety of capabilities including videoondemand payperview special events home shopping networks interactive entertainment and education services telephone services and highspeed internet access with respect to expanded channel capacity systems cable operators have generally adopted and the company believes that for the foreseeable future will continue to adopt network infrastructure using both fiber optic cable and coaxial cable such systems combine the advantages of fiber optic cable in transmitting clear signals over a long distance with the advantages of coaxial cable in ease of installation low cost and compatibility with the receiving components of the customer’s communication devices the company believes that while system operators are likely to increase their use of fiber optic cable for the trunk and feeder portions of the cable systems there will be an ongoing need for high capacity coaxial cable for the local distribution and streettothehome portions of the cable system in addition us cable system designs are increasingly being employed in international markets where cable television penetration is generally lower than in the us the company believes the development of full service cable television systems for the converging technologies of voice video and data communications presents an opportunity to increase sales of its coaxial cable and related products 

the company is also a leading producer of high speed data cables and specialty cables including flatribbon cable a cable made of wires assembled side by side such that the finished cable is flat flatribbon cable is used to connect internal components in systems with space and component configuration limitations the product is used in computer and office equipment applications as well as in a variety of telecommunication applications

subsequent to the acquisition of amphenol from allied signal corporation “allied signal” in 1987 allied signal merged with honeywell international inc in december 1999 “honeywell” amphenol and honeywell have been named jointly and severally liable as potentially responsible parties in relation to several environmental cleanup sites amphenol and honeywell jointly consented to perform certain investigations and remedial and monitoring activities at two sites the “route 8” landfill and the “sidney” landfill and they were jointly ordered to perform work at another site the “richardson hill road” landfill the costs incurred relating to these three sites are currently reimbursed by honeywell based on an agreement the “honeywell agreement” entered into in connection with the acquisition in 1987 for sites covered by the honeywell agreement to the extent that conditions or circumstances occurred or existed at the time of or prior to the acquisition honeywell is obligated to reimburse amphenol 100 of such costs honeywell representatives continue to work closely with the company in addressing the most significant environmental liabilities covered by the honeywell agreement management does not believe that the costs associated with resolution of these or any other environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition or results of operations the environmental investigation remedial and monitoring activities identified by the company including those referred to above are covered under the honeywell agreement 

owners and occupiers of sites containing hazardous substances as well as generators of hazardous substances are subject to broad liability under various federal and state environmental laws and regulations including expenditures for cleanup and monitoring costs and potential damages arising out of past disposal activities such liability in many cases may be imposed regardless of fault or the legality of the original disposal activity the company has performed remediation activities and is currently performing operations and maintenance and monitoring activities at three offsite disposal sites previously utilized by the company’s sidney facility and others to wit the richardson hill road landfill the route 8 landfill and the sidney landfill actions at the richardson hill road and sidney landfills were undertaken subsequent to designation as “superfund” sites on the national priorities list under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 the route 8 landfill was designated as a new york state inactive hazardous waste disposal site with remedial actions taken pursuant to chapter 6 section 3751 of the new york code of rules and regulations in addition the company is currently performing monitoring activities at and in proximity to its manufacturing site in sidney new york the company is also engaged in remediating 

or monitoring environmental conditions at certain of its other manufacturing facilities and has been named as a potentially responsible party for cleanup costs at other offsite disposal sites all such environmental matters referred to in this paragraph are covered by the honeywell agreement

if any of the following risks actually occur the company’s business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected in such case the trading price of the company’s common stock could decline and investors may lose all or part of their investment 

the company is dependent on the communications industry including telecommunication and data communication wireless communications and broadband communications 

approximately 61 of the company’s revenues for the year ended december 31 2006 came from sales to the communications industry including telecommunication and data communication wireless communications and broadband communications demand for these products is subject to rapid technological change see below—”the company is dependent on the acceptance of new product introductions for continued revenue growth” these markets are dominated by several large manufacturers and operators who regularly exert significant price pressure on their suppliers including the company while sales to the company’s largest customer accounted for approximately 7 of consolidated sales in 2006 the loss of one or more of the large communications customers could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to compete successfully in the communications industry and the company’s failure to do so could impair the company’s results of operations

approximately 11 of the company’s 2006 revenues came from sales to the broadband communications industry demand for the company’s broadband communications products depends primarily on capital spending by cable television operators for constructing rebuilding or upgrading their systems the amount of this capital spending and therefore the company’s sales and profitability will be affected by a variety of factors including general economic conditions acquisitions of cable television operators by noncable television operators cable system consolidation within the industry the financial condition of domestic cable television operators and their access to financing competition from satellite telephone and television providers and telephone companies technological developments and new legislation and regulation of cable television operators there can be 

no assurance that existing levels of cable television capital spending will continue or that cable television spending will not decrease 

changes in defense expenditures may reduce the company’s sales 

approximately 18 of the company’s 2006 revenues came from sales to the commercial aerospace and military market the company participates in a broad spectrum of defense programs and believes that no one program accounted for more than 1 of its 2006 revenues the substantial majority of these sales are related to both us and foreign military and defense programs however the company’s sales are generally to contractors and subcontractors of the us or foreign governments or to distributors that in turn sell to the contractors and subcontractors nevertheless the company’s sales are affected by changes in the defense budgets of the us and foreign governments the us defense budget declined in real terms from 1986 to 1998 beginning in 1999 the us defense budget has been increasing and increased again in 2006 nevertheless a decline in us defense expenditures and defense expenditures generally could adversely affect the company’s business 

the company encounters competition in substantially all areas of its business 

the company competes primarily on the basis of engineering product quality price customer service and delivery time competitors include large diversified companies some of which have substantially greater assets and financial resources than the company as well as medium to small companies there can be no assurance that additional competitors will not enter the company’s existing markets nor can there be any assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against existing or new competition 

the company is dependent on the acceptance of new product introductions for continued revenue growth 

the company estimates that products introduced in the last two years accounted for approximately 21 of 2006 net sales the company’s longterm results of operations depend substantially upon its ability to continue to conceive design source and market new products and upon continuing market acceptance of its existing and future product lines in the ordinary course of business the company continually develops or creates new product line concepts if the company fails or is significantly delayed in introducing new product line concepts or if the company’s new products do not meet with market acceptance our results of operations may be impaired 

covenants in the company’s credit agreements may adversely affect the company 

the company’s bank credit agreements contain financial and other covenants such as a limit on the ratio of debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization minimum levels of net worth and limits on incurrence of liens although the company believes none of these covenants are presently restrictive to the company’s operations the ability to meet the financial covenants can be affected by events beyond the company’s control and the company cannot provide assurance that the company will meet those tests a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the company’s credit agreements upon the occurrence of an event of default under any of the company’s credit facilities the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit if the lenders accelerate the repayment of borrowings the company cannot provide assurance that it will have sufficient assets to repay the company’s credit facilities and other indebtedness see “liquidity and capital resources” 

downgrades of the company’s debt rating could adversely affect the company 

if the credit rating agencies that rate the company’s debt were to downgrade the company’s credit rating in conjunction with a deterioration of the company’s performance it may increase the company’s cost of capital and make it more difficult for the company to obtain new financing 

the company’s results may be negatively affected by changing interest rates 

the company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on the company’s financing activities the company utilizes interest rate swap agreements to manage and mitigate its exposure to changes in interest rates at december 31 2006 the company had interest rate protection in the form of swaps that effectively fixed the company’s libor interest rate on 1500 million 2500 million and 2500 million of floating rate debt at 482 424 and 485 expiring in december 2007 july 2008 and december 2008 respectively at december 31 2006 the company’s average libor rate was 46 a 10 change in the libor interest rate at december 31 2006 would not have materially increased or decreased interest 

expense the company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2007 although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly change 

the company’s results may be negatively affected by foreign currency exchange rates 

the company conducts business in several international currencies through its worldwide operations and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the company’s sales gross margins and retained earnings the company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk by producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency and by managing its working capital there can be no assurance that this approach will be successful especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the company’s worldwide operations the company does not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes 

the company’s operating results may be adversely affected by foreign operations 

international manufacturing and sales are subject to inherent risks including changes in local economic or political conditions the imposition of currency exchange restrictions unexpected changes in regulatory environments potentially adverse tax consequences and the exchange rate risk discussed above there can be no assurance that these factors will not have a material adverse impact on the company’s production capabilities or otherwise adversely affect the company’s business and operating results 

the company may experience difficulties and unanticipated expense including the potential for the impairment of goodwill of assimilating newly acquired businesses 

the company has completed a number of acquisitions in the past few years it is possible the company may experience difficulty integrating such acquisitions and further that the acquisitions may not perform as expected at december 31 2006 the total assets on the company’s balance sheet were 21954 million which included 9262 million of goodwill the goodwill arose as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets of businesses acquired dating over the period 19872006 the company performs annual evaluations for the potential impairment of the carrying value of goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 142 such evaluations have not resulted in the need to recognize an impairment however if the financial performance of the company’s businesses were to decline significantly the company could incur a noncash charge to its income statement for the impairment of goodwill 

the company may experience difficulties in obtaining a consistent supply of materials at stable pricing levels 

the company uses basic materials like steel aluminum copper bimetallic products gold and plastic resins in its manufacturing process volatility in the prices of such material and availability of supply may have a substantial impact on the price the company pays for such products in addition to the extent such cost increases cannot be recovered through sales price increases or productivity improvements the company’s margin may decline 

the company may not be able to attract and retain key employees 

the company’s continued success depends upon its continued ability to hire and retain key employees at its operations around the world any difficulties in obtaining or retaining the management and other human resource competencies that the company needs to achieve its business objectives may have adverse affects on the company’s performance 

changes in general economic conditions and other factors beyond the company’s control may adversely impact its business 

the following factors could adversely impact the company’s business 

·   a global economic slowdown in any one or all of the company’s market segments

·   the effects of significant changes in monetary and fiscal policies in the us and abroad including significant currency fluctuations and unforeseen inflationary pressures

results of operations 

the following table sets forth the components of net income as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated 

   

2006 compared to 2005 

net sales were 24714   million for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to 18081 million for 2005 an increase of 37 in us dollars and 36 in local currencies the increase in sales over 2005 excluding acquisitions was 12 in us dollars and 11 in local currencies sales of interconnect products and assemblies approximately 90 of net sales increased 39 in us dollars and 38 in local currencies compared to 2005 22075 million in 2006 versus 15924 million in 2005 sales increased in the company’s major end markets including telecommunications and data communications mobile communications industrial and militaryaerospace markets sales to the telecommunications and data communications related markets increased approximately 3388 million reflecting the impact of the acquisition of tcs in december 2005 note 7 and increased sales of new high speed interconnect products for servers and other data center equipment applications the increase in sales in the mobile communications markets approximately 2090 million is attributable primarily to increased sales to the mobile device market relating to new products the impact of the acquisition of tcs in december 2005 and to a lesser extent to increased demand in the wireless infrastructure market from cell site installation customers the increase in sales in the industrial market approximately 558 million reflects increased sales in north america and europe relating to products for the factory automation medical and oilgeophysical markets and the impact of acquisitions the increase in militaryaerospace sales approximately 154 million relates to increased demand on commercial aircraft and military programs sales in the militaryaerospace market were adversely impacted by approximately 250 million in 2006 due to business interruption related to the flood at the company’s sidney new york facility further described below automotive sales declined approximately 81 million primarily as a result of a reduction in vehicle production rates by european and us vehicle manufacturers   sales of cable products approximately 10 of net sales increased 22 compared to 2005 2639 million in 2006 versus 2157 million in 2005 such increase is primarily due to increased sales in broadband cable television markets and the impact of price increases 

geographically sales in the us in 2006 increased approximately 32 compared to 2005 10600 million in 2006 versus 8024 million in 2005 international sales for 2006 increased approximately 40 in us dollars 14115 million in 2006 versus 10058 million in 2005 and increased approximately 39 in local currency compared to 2005 the comparatively weak us dollar in 2006 had the effect of increasing net sales by approximately 165 million when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2005 

the gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales decreased to 32 in 2006 compared to 33 in 2005 due primarily to a decrease in margins in the interconnect products and assemblies segment primarily as a result of the tcs acquisition note 7 the operating margin for interconnect products and assemblies decreased approximately 1 compared to the prior year tcs margins are lower than the average margin of the company and its inclusion in the consolidated results lowered the margin percentage interconnect segment margins excluding the impact of tcs were consistent with the prior year margins as the continuing development of new higher margin application specific products excellent operating leverage on incremental volume and aggressive programs of cost control offset increases resulting primarily from higher material costs in addition cable operating margins decreased 03 reflecting higher material and freight costs in 2006 driven by higher commodity and energy prices offset in part by the impact of price increases 

selling general and administrative expenses were 3428 million and 2571 million in 2006 and 2005 respectively or approximately 14 of sales in each year the increase in expense in 2006 is attributable to the impact of acquisitions and increases in the major components of selling general and administrative expenses as follows research and development expenditures increased approximately 136 million reflecting increases in expenditures for new product development and represented approximately 2 of sales for both 2006 and 2005 selling and marketing expenses remained approximately 7 of sales shipping expense which relates primarily to sales of cable products to the broadband market increased proportionately with sales for those products administrative expenses increased by approximately 342 million due primarily to increases in costs as a result of the tcs acquisition and stockbased compensation expense of 97 million as a result of the adoption of statement of financial accounting standard “sfas” no 123r “sharebased payment” which was effective on january 1 2006  in addition to general cost increases relating to professional fees pensions and employeerelated benefits

interest expense was 388 million for 2006 compared to 241 million for 2005 the increase is primarily attributable to higher interest rates and higher average debt levels related to the tcs acquisition note 7

iii   teradyne had significant restructuring activities in 2004 and 2005 at tcs resulting in related expenses which are included in the pro forma amounts presented above no significant restructuring activities are expected to take place in the future and as such these costs are considered nonrecurring and are therefore included above as expected savings

pensions 

the company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries have a defined benefit pension plan “plan” covering their us employees plan benefits are generally based on years of service and compensation and are generally noncontributory certain foreign subsidiaries also have defined benefit plans covering their employees the pension expense for all pension plans approximated 170 million 135 million and 101 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively and is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions established on january 1 of the applicable year including an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets in developing the expected longterm rate of return assumption for the plan we evaluated input from our actuaries and investment consultants as well as longterm inflation assumptions projected returns by such consultants are based on broad equity and bond indices we also considered our historical seventeenyear compounded return of 115 which has been in excess of these broad equity and bond benchmark indices our expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of 60 with equity managers with an expected longterm rate of return of 11 25 with fixed income managers with an expected longterm rate of return of 675 and 15 with high yield bond managers with an expected rate of return of 8 as of december 31 2006 our asset allocation was 69 with equity managers and 31 with fixed income managers including high yield managers we believe that our longterm asset allocation on average will approximate 60 with equity managers and 40 with fixed income managers we regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate based on this methodology the company’s expected longterm rate of return assumption is 95 for both 2006 and 2005 

the discount rate used by the company for valuing pension liabilities is based on a review of high quality corporate bond yields with maturities approximating the remaining life of the projected benefit obligations the discount rate on this basis has increased from 550 at december 31 2005 to 575 at december 31 2006 this will have the effect of decreasing pension expense in 2007 by approximately 6 million although future changes to the discount rate are unknown had the discount rate increased or decreased 50 basis points the pension liability would have decreased 138 million or increased 152 million respectively 

effective january 1 2007 the company effected a curtailment related to the plan which will result in no additional benefits being credited to salaried employees who have less than 25 years service with the company or who have not attained age 50 and who have less than 15 years of service with the company this change had the impact of decreasing the unfunded pension liability by 51 million at december 31 2006 and will have the effect of decreasing pension expense during 2007 by approximately 29 million for affected employees the curtailment in additional plan benefits was replaced with a company match defined contribution plan to which the company expects to contribute approximately 18 million in 2007 

the company made cash contributions to the plan of 15 million and 10 million in 2006 and 2005 respectively the liability for accrued pension and post employment benefit obligations under the plan increased in 2006 to 1383 million from 1088 million in 2005 primarily due to the implementation of sfas 158 see liquidity and capital resources section which resulted in an increase of approximately 211 million and the foreign currency translation effect of nonus pension plans the company estimates that based on current actuarial calculations it will make a voluntary cash contribution to the plan in 2007 of approximately 150 to 200 million cash contributions in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors including the investment performance of plan assets and the impact of the pension protection act of 2006 which was signed into law in august 2006 the intent of the legislation is to require companies to fund 100 of their pension liability and then for companies to fund on a goingforward basis an amount generally estimated to be the amount that the pension liability increases each year due to an additional year of service by the employees eligible for pension benefits the legislation requires that funding shortfalls be eliminated by companies over a sevenyear period beginning in 2008 the pension protection act also extended the provisions of the pension funding equity act that would have expired in 2006 had the pension protection act not been enacted which increased the allowed discount rate used to calculate the pension liability the pension protection act is effective for plan years beginning after 2007 and the company is in the process of determining the impact of this legislation 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates estimates are adjusted as new information becomes available the company’s significant accounting policies are set forth below 

revenue recognition  the company’s primary source of revenues is from product sales to its customers revenue from sales of the company’s products is recognized at the time the goods are delivered and title passes provided the earning process is complete and revenue is measurable delivery is determined by the company’s shipping terms which are primarily fob shipping point revenue is recorded at the net amount to be received after deductions for estimated discounts allowances and returns these estimates and reserves are determined and adjusted as needed based upon historical experience contract terms and other related factors the shipping costs for the majority of the company’s sales are paid directly by the company’s customers in the broadband communication market approximately 11 of consolidated sales the company pays for shipping cost to the majority of its customers amounts billed to customers related to shipping costs are immaterial and are included in net sales shipping costs incurred to transport products to the customer which are not reimbursed are included in selling general and administrative expense 

inventories  inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost which approximates average cost or market provisions for slow moving and obsolete inventory are made based on historical experience and product demand should future product demand change existing inventory could become slow moving or obsolete and provisions would be increased accordingly 

depreciable assets  property plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation the appropriateness and the recoverability of the carrying value of such assets are periodically reviewed taking into consideration current and expected business conditions historically the company has not had any significant impairments 

goodwill  the company performs its annual evaluation for the impairment of goodwill for the company’s reporting units in accordance with sfas no 142 as of each june 30 goodwill impairment for each reporting unit is evaluated using a twostep approach requiring the company to determine the fair value of the reporting unit and compare that to the carrying value including goodwill if the carrying value exceeded the fair value the goodwill of the reporting unit would be potentially impaired and a second step of additional testing would be performed to measure the impairment loss historically the company has not had any impairments 

defined benefit plan obligation – the defined benefit plan obligation is based on significant assumptions such as mortality rates discount rates and plan asset rates of return as determined by the company in consultation with the respective benefit plan actuaries and investment advisors 

the significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 to the company’s consolidated financial statements

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the company in the normal course of doing business is exposed to the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

the company conducts business in several international currencies through its worldwide operations and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the company’s sales gross margins and retained earnings the company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk by producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency and by managing its working capital although there can be no assurance that this approach will be successful especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the company’s worldwide operations the company does not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes 

interest rate risk 

relative to interest rate risk the company completed a refinancing of its senior credit facilities during the third quarter 2005 as discussed in liquidity and capital resources above in conjunction with the 2005 refinancing and the funds drawn in conjunction with the december 2005 tcs acquisition note 7 the company entered into interest rate swap agreements that fixed the company’s libor interest rate on 1500 million 2500 million and 2500 million of floating rate debt at 482 424 and 485 expiring in december 2007 july 2008 and december 2008 respectively at december 31 2006 the company’s average libor rate was 461 a 10 change in the libor interest rate at december 31 2006 would not have materially increased or decreased interest expense the company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2007 although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly change

cautionary statements for purposes of forward looking information 

  

statements made by the company in written or oral form to various persons including statements made in filings with the sec that are not strictly historical facts are “forward looking” statements such statements should be considered as subject to uncertainties that exist in the company’s operations and business environment 

  




 item 1a risk factors 

  

investors should carefully consider the risks described below and all other information in this form 10k the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the company additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the company or that it currently deems immaterial may also impair the company’s business and operations 

  

if any of the following risks actually occur the company’s business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected in such case the trading price of the company’s common stock could decline and investors may lose all or part of their investment 

  

the company is dependent on the communications industry including telecommunication and data communication wireless communications and cable television 

  

approximately 51 of the company’s revenues for the year ended december 31 2005 came from sales to the communications industry including telecommunication and data communication wireless communications and cable television demand for these products is subject to rapid technological change see below—”the company is dependent on the acceptance of new product introductions for continued revenue growth” these markets are dominated by several large manufacturers and operators who regularly exert significant price pressure on their suppliers including the company while sales to the 

  

  

company’s largest customer were less than 4 of consolidated sales the loss of one or more of the large communications manufacturers or operators could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to compete successfully in the communications industry and the company’s failure to do so could impair the company’s results of operations 

  

approximately 12 of the company’s revenues for the year ended december 31 2005 came from sales to the cable television industry demand for the company’s cable television products depends primarily on capital spending by cable television operators for constructing rebuilding or upgrading their systems the amount of this capital spending and therefore the company’s sales and profitability will be affected by a variety of factors including general economic conditions acquisitions of cable television operators by noncable television operators cable system consolidation within the industry the financial condition of domestic cable television operators and their access to financing competition from satellite and wireless television providers and telephone companies technological developments and new legislation and regulation of cable television operators there can be no assurance that existing levels of cable television capital spending will continue or that cable television spending will not decrease 

  

changes in defense expenditures may reduce the company’s sales 

  

approximately 24 of the company’s revenues for the year ended december 31 2005 came from sales to the commercial aerospace and military market the company participates in a broad spectrum of defense programs and believes that no one program accounted for more than 2 of its revenues for the year ended december 31 2005 the substantial majority of these sales are related to both us and foreign military and defense programs however the company’s sales are generally to contractors and subcontractors of the us or foreign governments or to distributors that in turn sell to the contractors and subcontractors nevertheless the company’s sales are affected by changes in the defense budgets of the us and foreign governments the us defense budget declined in real terms from 1986 to 1998 beginning in 1999 the us defense budget has been increasing and increased again in 2005 nevertheless a decline in us defense expenditures and defense expenditures generally could adversely affect the company’s business 

  

the company encounters competition in substantially all areas of its business 

  

the company competes primarily on the basis of engineering product quality price customer service and delivery time competitors include large diversified companies some of which have substantially greater assets and financial resources than the company as well as medium to small companies there can be no assurance that additional competitors will not enter the company’s existing markets nor can there be any assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against existing or new competition 

  

the company is dependent on the acceptance of new product introductions for continued revenue growth 

  

the company estimates that products introduced in the last two years accounted for approximately 20 of net sales for the year ended december 31 2005 the company’s longterm results of operations depend substantially upon its ability to continue to conceive design source and market new products and upon continuing market acceptance of its existing and future product lines in the ordinary course of business the company continually develop or create new product line concepts if the company fails or is significantly delayed in introducing new product line concepts or if the company’s new products do not meet with market acceptance our results of operations may be impaired 

  

covenants in the company’s credit agreements may adversely affect the company 

  

the company’s bank credit agreements contain financial and other covenants such as a limit on the ratio of debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization minimum levels of net worth and limits on incurrence of liens although the company believes none of these covenants are presently restrictive to the company’s operations the ability to meet the financial covenants can be affected by events beyond the company’s control and the company cannot provide assurance that the company will meet those tests a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the company’s credit agreements upon the occurrence of an event of default under any of the company’s credit facilities the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit if the lenders accelerate the repayment of borrowings the company cannot provide assurance that it will have sufficient assets to repay the company’s credit facilities and other indebtedness see “liquidity and capital resources” 

  

  

downgrades of the company’s debt rating could adversely affect the company 

  

if the credit rating agencies that rate the company’s debt were to downgrade the company’s credit rating in conjunction with a deterioration of the company’s performance it may increase the company’s cost of capital and make it more difficult for the company to obtain new financing 

  

the company’s results may be negatively affected by changing interest rates 

  

the company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on the company’s financing activities the company utilizes interest rate swap agreements to manage and mitigate its exposure to changes in interest rates at december 31 2005 the company had interest rate protection in the form of swaps that effectively fixed the company’s libor interest rate on 1500 million 2500 million and 2500 million of floating rate debt at 482 424 and 485 expiring in december 2007 july 2008 and december 2008 respectively at december 31 2005 the company’s average libor rate was 46 a 10 change in the libor interest rate at december 31 2005 would have had the effect of increasing or decreasing interest expense by approximately 03 million the company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2006 although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly change 

  

the company’s results may be negatively affected by foreign currency exchange rates 

  

the company conducts business in several international currencies through its worldwide operations and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the company’s sales gross margins and retained earnings the company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk by producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency and by managing its working capital although there can be no assurance that this approach will be successful especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the company’s worldwide operations the company does not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes 

  

the company’s operating results may be adversely affected by foreign operations 

  

international manufacturing and sales are subject to inherent risks including changes in local economic or political conditions the imposition of currency exchange restrictions unexpected changes in regulatory environments potentially adverse tax consequences and the exchange rate risk discussed above there can be no assurance that these factors will not have a material adverse impact on the company’s production capabilities or otherwise adversely affect the company’s business and operating results 

  

the company may experience difficulties and unanticipated expense including the potential for the impairment of goodwill of assimilating newly acquired businesses 

  

the company has completed a number of acquisitions in the past few years it is possible the company may experience difficulty integrating such acquisitions and further that the acquisitions may not perform as expected at december 31 2005 the total assets on the company’s balance sheet were 19325 million which included 8867 million of goodwill the goodwill arose as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets of businesses acquired dating over the period 19872005 the company performs annual evaluations for the potential impairment of the carrying value of goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 142 such evaluations have not resulted in the need to recognize an impairment however if the financial performance of the company’s businesses were to decline significantly the company could incur a noncash charge to its income statement for the impairment of goodwill 

  

the company may experience difficulties in obtaining a consistent supply of materials at stable pricing levels 

  

the company uses basic materials like steel aluminum copper bimetallic products gold and plastic resins in its manufacturing process volatility in the prices of such material and availability of supply may have a substantial impact on the price the company pays for such products in addition to the extent such cost increases cannot be recovered through sales price increases or productivity improvements the company’s margin may decline 

  

  

the company may not be able to attract and retain key employees 

  

the company’s continued success depends upon its continued ability to hire and retain key employees at its operations around the world any difficulties in obtaining or retaining the management and other human resource competencies that the company needs to achieve its business objectives may have adverse affects on the company’s performance 

  

changes in general economic conditions and other factors beyond the company’s control may adversely impact its business 

  

the following factors could adversely impact the company’s business 

  

•   a global economic slowdown in any one or all of the company’s market segments 

  

•   the effects of significant changes in monetary and fiscal policies in the us and abroad including significant currency fluctuations and unforeseen inflationary pressures 

  

•   rapid material escalation of the cost of regulatory compliance and litigation

tcs acquisition 

  

on december 1 2005 pursuant to an asset and stock purchase agreement dated october 10 2005 the “asset purchase agreement” by and among the company and teradyne corporation inc a massachusetts corporation “teradyne” the company purchased substantially all of the assets and assumed certain of the liabilities of teradyne’s backplane and connection systems business segment “tcs” including the stock of certain of its operating subsidiaries for a total purchase price of 3847 million in cash in addition amphenol incurred approximately 88 million of transaction related expenses the accompanying consolidated statement of income for the year ended december 31 2005 includes the results of tcs for the period subsequent to the acquisition date sales of approximately 340 million and minimal net income resulting in no impact to 2005 consolidated net earnings per share 

  

tcs is headquartered in nashua new hampshire and is a leading supplier of highspeed highdensity printed circuit board interconnect products tcs sells its products primarily to the data communications storage and server markets wireless infrastructure markets and industrial markets tcs had sales of 3730 million for the year ended december 31 2005 

  

the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with sfas no 141 “business combinations” accordingly the purchase price was allocated first to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets and then to the liabilities of tcs based upon their fair market values the excess purchase price over the fair market value of the underlying net assets acquired was allocated to goodwill the company is in the process of completing its analysis of fair value attributes of the assets acquired through the use of independent appraisals and management’s estimates it is anticipated that the final assessment of values will not differ materially from the preliminary assessment 

  

in connection with the acquisition the company recorded 2393 million of goodwill and 455 million of acquired intangible assets of which 304 million 90 million and 61 million was assigned to proprietary technology customer relationships and license agreements respectively all of which are subject to amortization the acquired intangible assets have a total weightedaverage useful life of approximately 12 years the license agreements proprietary technology and customer relationships have a weighted average useful life of 8 years 15 years and 5 years respectively the entire amount of goodwill was assigned to the interconnect segment all of which is expected to be deductible for tax purposes 

  

the following table summarizes the unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information assuming that the tcs acquisition actually occurred as of the beginning of the period presented on a pro forma basis for the year ended december 31 2005 tcs had sales and operating income of 3730 million and 67 million respectively such amounts along with 222 million of additional pro forma interest expense and related bank fees on borrowings to fund the acquisition are reflected in the pro forma amounts shown below the pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and reflect a reasonable estimate of the effects of the tcs acquisition for the periods presented on the basis set forth herein the unaudited pro forma financial information is presented for informational purposes only and does not purport to represent what the company’s financial position or results of operations would have been had the tcs acquisition in fact occurred on the dates assumed nor is it necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected in future periods 

  

 

  

to supplement the pro forma combined financial information presented above the company uses certain measures which are adjusted from the pro forma gaap amounts based upon actions taken either on the purchase date or known subsequent changes in cost structure the results of which are as shown below these adjustments are provided to enhance the user’s overall understanding of the company’s current and expected financial performance and are “forward looking” the adjustments are presented for informational purposes only and do not purport to represent what our financial position or results of operations would have been had the tcs acquisition in fact occurred on the dates assumed nor are they necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected in future periods such information should be considered as subject to uncertainties that exist in the company’s operations and business environment the following table sets forth cash savings that are expected to be achieved as of or immediately following the acquisition date as well as the reversal of non recurring restructuring costs and non recurring gains on the sale of a business which management does not expect to reoccur in the future this information is included to assist investors and management in assessing the company’s operating results in a manner that is focused on the performance of the company’s ongoing combined operations 

  

  

 

  

i   in conjunction with the acquisition tcs’s historical management incentive plan was terminated and replaced by an incentive plan which has higher profitability targets these targets would not have been achieved at tcs’s historic profitability levels and as such the related expense would not have been incurred 

ii   teradyne had historically allocated corporate general and administrative costs to tcs which are included in the pro forma amounts presented above such costs included information technology human resources tax legal corporate treasury and finance as well as executive administration related items the acquisition agreement included the hiring of certain teradyne employees and assumption of certain agreements that related to services historically performed by teradyne for tcs in addition amphenol assumed the performance of certain tax and treasury functions for tcs this adjustment represents the excess of the amount charged to tcs by teradyne for those centralized services over the actual cost incurred by tcs and amphenol since the acquisition 

iii   teradyne had significant restructuring activities in 2004 and 2005 at tcs resulting in related expenses which are included in the pro forma amounts presented above no significant restructuring activities are expected to take place in the future and as such these costs are considered nonrecurring and are therefore included above as expected savings 

iv   tcs had recognized gains on the sale of a business in 2004 and 2005 which are included in the pro forma amounts presented above these gains are not expected to occur in the future 

  

environmental matters 

  

subsequent to the acquisition of amphenol from allied signal corporation in 1987 allied signal merged with honeywell international inc “honeywell” in december 1999 amphenol and honeywell have been named jointly and severally liable as potentially responsible parties in relation to several environmental cleanup sites amphenol and honeywell have jointly consented to perform certain investigations and remedial and monitoring activities at two sites and they have been jointly ordered to perform work at another site the costs incurred relating to these three sites are currently reimbursed by honeywell based on an agreement entered into in connection with the acquisition in 1987 for sites covered by this agreement to the extent that conditions or circumstances occurred or existed at the time of or prior to the acquisition honeywell is obligated to reimburse amphenol 100 of such costs honeywell representatives work closely with the company in addressing the most significant environmental liabilities covered by the agreement management does not believe that the costs associated with resolution of these or any other environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition or results of operations the environmental investigation remedial and monitoring activities identified by the company including those referred to above are covered under the honeywell agreement 

  

inflation and costs 

  

the cost of the company’s products is influenced by the cost of a wide variety of raw materials including precious metals such as gold and silver used in plating aluminum copper brass and steel used for contacts shells and cable and plastic materials used in molding connector bodies inserts and cable in general increases in the cost of raw materials labor and services have been offset by price increases productivity improvements and cost saving programs 

  

risk management 

  

the company has to a significant degree mitigated its exposure to currency risk in its business operations by manufacturing and procuring its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold so that costs reflect local economic conditions in other cases involving us export sales raw materials are a significant component of product costs for the majority of such sales and raw material costs are generally dollar based on a worldwide scale such as basic metals and petroleumderived materials 

  

  

stock split 

  

on january 21 2004 the company announced a 2for1 stock split that was effective for shareholders of record as of march 17 2004 the additional shares were distributed on march 29 2004 the share information included herein reflects the effect of such stock split 

  

recent accounting changes 

  

in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued statement of financial accounting standard no “fas” 123r “sharebased payment” fas 123r applies to all transactions involving the issuance by a company of its own equity stock stock options or other equity instruments in exchange for goods or services including employee services fas 123r requires entities to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stockbased compensation using the fair value of those stocks on the grant date with limited exceptions in april 2005 the effective date of this statement was deferred and was effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after june 15 2005 the company has adopted fas 123r on january 1 2006 using the modified prospective method the impact of adoption of fas 123r is expected to result in approximately 100 million of pretax expense during 2006 although it will depend in part on the level of sharebased payments granted 

  

pensions 

  

the company and its domestic subsidiaries have a defined benefit pension plan “plan” covering us employees plan benefits are generally based on years of service and compensation and are generally noncontributory certain foreign subsidiaries also have defined benefit plans covering their employees the pension expense for all pension plans approximated 135 million 101 million and 65 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively and is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions established on january 1 of the applicable year including an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets in developing the expected longterm rate of return assumption for us plans we evaluated input from our actuaries and investment consultants as well as longterm inflation assumptions projected returns by such consultants are based on broad equity and bond indices we also considered our historical sixteenyear compounded return of 113 which has been in excess of these broad equity and bond benchmark indices our expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of 60 with equity managers with an expected longterm rate of return of 11 25 with fixed income managers with an expected longterm rate of return of 675 and 15 with high yield bond managers with an expected rate of return of 85 as of december 31 2005 our asset allocation was 66 with equity managers and 34 with fixed income managers including high yield managers we believe that our longterm asset allocation on average will approximate 60 with equity managers and 40 with fixed income managers we regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate based on this methodology the company’s expected longterm rate of return assumption is 95 for both 2005 and 2004 

  

the discount rate used by the company for valuing pension liabilities is based on a review of high quality corporate bond yields with maturities approximating the remaining life of the projected benefit obligations the discount rate on this basis has decreased from 575 at december 31 2004 to 550 at december 31 2005 this will have the effect of increasing pension expense in 2006 by approximately 7 million although future changes to the discount rate are unknown had the discount rate increased or decreased 50 basis points the pension liability would have decreased 150 million or increased 155 million respectively 

  

the company made cash contributions to the us pension plans of 100 million and 200 million in 2005 and 2004 respectively the liability for accrued pension and post employment benefit obligations increased modestly in 2005 to 1088 million from 1021 million in 2004 due to the negative impact on accumulated liabilities of the reduction in the discount rate and the foreign currency translation effect for nonus plans the company estimates that based on current actuarial calculations it will make a voluntary cash contribution to the pension plan in 2006 of approximately 100 to 150 million cash contributions in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors including the investment performance of plan assets 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates estimates are adjusted as new information becomes available the company’s significant accounting policies are set forth below 

  

  

revenue recognition  sales and related cost of sales are recognized upon shipment of products allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts discounts returns and allowances are provided based upon historical experience current trends and specific information which indicate that an allowance is appropriate 

  

inventories  inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost which approximates average cost or market provisions for slow moving and obsolete inventory are made based on historical experience and product demand should future product demand change existing inventory could become slow moving or obsolete and provisions would be increased accordingly 

  

depreciable assets  property plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation the appropriateness and the recoverability of the carrying value of such assets are periodically reviewed taking into consideration current and expected business conditions historically the company has not had any significant impairments 

  

goodwill  the company performs its annual evaluation for the impairment of goodwill for the company’s reporting units in accordance with fas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” as of each june 30 goodwill impairment for each reporting unit is evaluated using a twostep approach requiring the company to determine the fair value of the reporting unit and to compare that to the carrying value including goodwill if the carrying value exceeds the fair value the goodwill of the reporting unit would be potentially impaired and a second step of additional testing would be performed to measure the impairment loss historically the company has not had any impairments 

  

the significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 to the company’s consolidated financial statements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

the company in the normal course of doing business is exposed to the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 

  

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

  

the company conducts business in several international currencies through its worldwide operations and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the company’s sales gross margins and retained earnings the company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk by producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency and by managing its working capital although there can be no assurance that this approach will be successful especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the company’s worldwide operations the company does not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes 

  

interest rate risk 

  

relative to interest rate risk the company completed a refinancing of its senior credit facilities during the third quarter 2005 as discussed in liquidity and capital resources above in conjunction with the 2005 refinancing and the funds drawn in conjunction with the tcs acquisition see note 7 to the company’s consolidated financial statements the company entered into interest rate swap agreements that fixed the company’s libor interest rate on 1500 million 2500 million and 2500 million of floating rate debt at 482 424 and 485 expiring in december 2007 july 2008 and december 2008 respectively at december 31 2005 the company’s average libor rate was 46 a 10 change in the libor interest rate at december 31 2005 would have the effect of increasing or decreasing interest expense by approximately 03 million the company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2006 although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly change

recent accounting changes 

  

in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard no 123r “fas 123r” “sharebased payment” fas 123r applies to all transactions involving the issuance by a company of its own equity stock stock options or other equity instruments in exchange for goods or services including employee services fas 123r requires entities to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stockbased compensation using the fair value of those stocks on the grantdate with limited exceptions this statement is effective for the first interim reporting period beginning after june 15 2005 the company is currently assessing the impact that this statement will have on the company’s consolidated financial statements but does not anticipate the impact to be more than 2 million per quarter based on the options outstanding as of december 31 2004 

  

in december 2003 the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 the “act” was enacted the act introduced a new prescription drug benefit under medicare “medicare part d” as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a prescription drug benefit that is at a minimum actuarially equivalent to medicare part d fasb staff position “fsp” 1062 “accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003” was provided by the fasb to offer guidance on accounting and disclosure requirements for the act the company does not believe the new act will have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements 

  

in november 2004 the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 151 “fas 151” “inventory costs – an amendment of arb no 43 chapter 4” in an effort to conform us accounting standards for inventories to international accounting standards fas 151 requires idle facility expenses freight handling costs and wasted material spoilage costs to be recognized as current period charges it also requires that the allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the relevant production facilities fas 151 will be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june 15 2005 the company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard but does not believe that it will have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements 

  

  

pensions 

  

the company and its domestic subsidiaries have a defined benefit pension plan “plan” covering substantially all us employees plan benefits are generally based on years of service and compensation and are generally noncontributory certain foreign subsidiaries also have defined benefit plans covering their employees the pension expense for all pension plans approximated 101 million 65 million and 07 million in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively and is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions established on january 1 of the applicable year including an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets in developing the expected longterm rate of return assumption for us plans we evaluated input from our actuaries and investment consultants as well as longterm inflation assumptions projected returns by such consultants are based on broad equity and bond indices we also considered our historical fifteenyear compounded return of 101 which has been in excess of these broad equity and bond benchmark indices our expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of 60 with equity managers with an expected longterm rate of return of 11 25 with fixed income managers with an expected longterm rate of return of 675 and 15 with high yield bond managers with an expected rate of return of 85 as of december 31 2004 our asset allocation was 65 with equity managers and 35 with fixed income managers including high yield managers we believe that our longterm asset allocation on average will approximate 60 with equity managers and 40 with fixed income managers we regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate based on this methodology the company’s expected longterm rate of return assumption is 95 for both 2004 and 2003 

  

the discount rate used by the company for valuing pension liabilities is based on a review of high quality corporate bond yields with maturities approximating the remaining life of the projected benefit obligations the discount rate on this basis has decreased from 615 at december 31 2003 to 575 at december 31 2004 this will have the effect of increasing pension expense in 2005 by approximately 19 million although future changes to the discount rate are unknown had the discount rate increased or decreased 50 basis points the pension liability would have decreased 132 million or increased 145 million respectively 

  

the company made cash contributions to the us pension plans of 20 million and 10 million in 2004 and 2003 respectively the liability for accrued pension and post employment benefit obligations increased modestly in 2004 to 1021 million from 1003 million in 2003 due to the negative impact on accumulated liabilities of the reduction in the discount rate and the foreign currency translation effect for nonus plans the company estimates that based on current actuarial calculations it will make a cash contribution to the pension plan in 2005 of approximately 10 million cash contributions in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors including the investment performance of plan assets 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates estimates are adjusted as new information becomes available the company’s significant accounting policies are set forth below

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

  

the company conducts business in several international currencies through its worldwide operations and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the company’s sales gross margins and retained earnings the company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk by producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold and thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency and by managing its working capital although there can be no assurance that this approach will be successful especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the company’s worldwide operations the company does not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes 

  

interest rate risk

results of operations 

the following table sets forth the components of net income as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated 

 15 

2003 compared to 2002 

net sales were 12395 million for the year ended december 31 2003 compared to 10620 million for 2002 sales of interconnect products and assemblies increased 20 compared to 2002 10720 million in 2003 versus 8923 million in 2002 sales increased in the companys major end markets including militaryaerospace mobile communications industrial automotive and computerdata communications markets the increases occurred in all major geographic regions with approximately one third of the increase attributable to the effect of currency translation as detailed below the remaining increase was attributable to the continuing development of new application specific and value added products economic improvement in some of the companys major end markets and acquisitions in 2002 and 2003 the increase in militaryaerospace sales approximately 47 million relates primarily to increased demand on military programs and avionics applications in north america and europe and an acquisition 8 million the increase in sales in the mobile communications markets approximately 42 million is attributable to the acquisition of companies in north america and china serving the network infrastructure market approximately 18 million and increases in asia in sales of handset products the increase in sales in the industrial market approximately 36 million reflects increases resulting from acquisitions in north america approximately 16 million and increased sales in europe automotive sales increased approximately 33 million primarily in europe and to a lesser extent in north america reflecting increased use of safety and telematic applications in cars sales to the computer and data communications related markets increased approximately 23 million a cable assembly acquisition in north america contributed one third of the increase the remainder reflects increased sales in europe and asia sales of cable products decreased 1 compared to 2002 1675 million in 2003 versus 1697 million in 2002 such decrease is generally attributable to continuing low levels of capital spending by us and international cable television operators for cable system upgrades and expansion the lower levels of spending are not expected to change significantly in the near term 

geographically sales in the us in 2003 increased approximately 11 compared to 2002 5559 million in 2003 versus 5011 million in 2002 international sales for 2003 increased approximately 22 in us dollars 6836 million in 2003 versus 5609 million in 2002 and increased approximately 12 in local currency compared to 2002 the comparatively weak us dollar in 2003 had the currency effect of increasing net sales by approximately 639 million when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2002 

the gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales including depreciation in cost of sales remained constant at 31 for 2003 and 2002 an increase in margins in the interconnect products and assemblies segment was offset by a decline in margins in the cable products segment the operating margin for interconnect products and assemblies increased approximately 2 compared to the prior year the increase is generally attributable to the effects of higher sales volume and cost reduction activities relating to purchased materials and increased activity in low cost labor areas the increase was offset by a decline in operating profit margins for cable products of approximately 6 compared to the prior year due primarily to higher material costs and change in product mix 

selling general and administrative expenses were 1774 million and 1529 million in 2003 and 2002 respectively and remained constant at approximately 14 of sales research and development expenditures increased approximately 22 million reflecting increases in expenditures for new product development selling and marketing expenses remained constant at approximately 7 of sales shipping expense which relates primarily to sales of cable products to the broadband market remained stable commensurate with sales for those products administrative expenses increased by approximately 69 million due primarily to increases in costs relating to insurance pensions and medical benefits 

interest expense was 295 million for 2003 compared to 459 million for 2002 the decrease is primarily attributable to lower interest rates including the effect of the refinancing completed in the 

second quarter of 2003 see liquidity and capital resources and lower average debt levels at current interest rates interest expense for 2004 is expected to be approximately 23 million 

expenses for early extinguishment of debt totaling 104 million in 2003 relate to the refinancing of the companys senior credit facilities such onetime expenses include the call premium related to the redemption of the companys senior subordinated notes of 47 million writeoff of unamortized deferred debt issuance costs of 39 million and other related fees and expenses of 18 million 

other expenses net for 2003 and 2002 was 70 million and 54 million respectively other expenses net is comprised primarily of foreign currency transaction losses 13 million in 2003 and 27 million in 2002 reflecting the relative weakness of the us dollar in 2003 and 2002 program fees on sale of accounts receivable 15 million in 2003 and 18 million in 2002 reflecting lower receivable fee rates in 2003 minority interests 24 million in 2003 and 18 million in 2002 and agency and commitment fees on the companys credit facilities 8 million in 2003 and 6 million in 2002 in addition in 2003 the company incurred 10 million in expenses relating to a secondary stock offering for which the company did not receive any proceeds and in 2002 the company realized 15 million of income relating to a license fee settlement see note 8 to the companys consolidated financial statements for details of the components of other expenses net 

the provision for income taxes for 2003 was at an effective rate of 34 compared to 345 in 2002 

2002 compared to 2001 

net sales were 10620 million for the year ended december 31 2002 compared to 11038 million for 2001 sales of interconnect products and assemblies decreased 2 compared to 2001 8923 million in 2002 versus 9068 million in 2001 such decrease is primarily attributable to decreased sales approx 528 million of products and interconnect systems for telecom infrastructure datacom and industrial markets these declines occurred primarily in north america and to a lesser extent in europe and resulted from a generally slowing economy and a continuing slowdown in communication related markets major oem customers that manufacture equipment for telecom infrastructure including wireless and internet related applications experienced a slowdown in purchases from system operators due to a variety of factors including the availability of capital and a shortfall from expectations of demand such declines were partially offset by increased sales approx 383 million of products and interconnect systems for military aerospace automotive and wireless handset markets the increase in sales of military aerospace products approximately 12 million relates primarily to the acquisition of a backplane assembly business in north america the increase in automotive sales approximately 11 million occurred primarily in north america and relates to the increasing use of electronic componentry in automobiles the increase in sales in the wireless handset market approximately 15 million reflects the strong market for these products in asia sales of cable products decreased 14 compared to 2001 1697 million in 2002 versus 1970 million in 2001 such decrease is primarily attributable to a slowdown in capital spending by us and international cable television operators 

geographically sales in the us in 2002 decreased approximately 7 compared to 2001 5011 million in 2002 versus 5389 million in 2001 international sales for 2002 decreased approximately 1 in us dollars 5609 million in 2002 versus 5648 million in 2001 and decreased approximately 3 in local currency compared to 2001 the comparatively weaker us dollar in 2002 had the currency effect of increasing net sales by approximately 144 million when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2001 

the gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales including depreciation in cost of sales was 31 for 2002 compared to 33 for 2001 the decrease in gross profit margin is generally attributable to a difficult pricing environment particularly in the communications markets and the adverse effect 

on production costs of the lower sales volume partially offset by cost reduction programs relating to purchased materials and services and a shift of headcount from high cost to low cost labor areas 

selling general and administrative expenses were 1529 million and 1558 million in 2002 and 2001 respectively and remained constant at approximately 14 of sales research and development expenditures increased approximately 16 million reflecting increases in expenditures for new product development selling and marketing expenses remained constant at approximately 7 of sales shipping expense which relates primarily to sales of cable products to the broadband market declined approximately 26 million commensurate with sales declines for those products administrative expenses were down by approximately 15 million due to a reduction in compensation cost 

goodwill amortization expense was nil in 2002 as a result of adopting fas no142 whereas goodwill amortization was 143 million in 2001 

interest expense was 459 million for 2002 compared to 561 million for 2001 the decrease is primarily attributable to lower average debt levels and lower interest rates 

other expenses net for 2002 and 2001 was 54 million and 56 million respectively other expenses net is comprised primarily of foreign currency transaction gains and losses 27 million loss in 2002 and 14 million gain in 2001 reflecting the relative weakness of the us dollar in 2002 and strength in 2001 program fees on sale of accounts receivable 18 million in 2002 and 39 million in 2001 reflecting lower receivable sales and fee rates in 2002 minority interests 18 million in 2002 and 2001 and agency and commitment fees on the companys credit facilities 6 million in 2002 and 5 million in 2001 in addition in 2002 the company realized 15 million of income relating to a license fee settlement see note 8 to the companys consolidated financial statements for details of the components of other expenses net 

the provision for income taxes for 2002 was at an effective rate of 345 compared to 382 in 2001 for 2001 the effective tax rate excluding nondeductible goodwill amortization was 35 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash provided by operating activities totaled 1594 million 1316 million and 1189 million for 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively the increase in cash from operating activities in 2003 compared to 2002 is primarily attributable to an increase in net income partially offset by a smaller reduction in the 2003 period in noncash components of working capital the increase in cash from operating activities in 2002 compared to 2001 is primarily attributable to a net decrease in noncash components of working capital offset in part by a decrease in net income 

the noncash components of working capital decreased 10 million in 2003 due primarily to a 208 million increase in accounts payable an operating reduction of 46 million in inventory and an increase of 102 million in accrued liabilities partially offset by a 288 million increase in accounts receivable due to higher sales levels

cash from operating activities was used for capital expenditures 302 million 188 million and 386 million in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively and acquisitions 511 million 338 million and 605 million in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively 

in 2003 cash from operating activities of 1594 million proceeds from the refinancing of 270 million additional sales of receivables of 106 million and proceeds from exercise of stock options and related tax benefits of 359 million were used primarily to fund capital expenditures of 302 million acquisitions of 511 million an increase in cash on hand of 29 million and for a net debt reduction of 1488 million for 2002 cash from operating activities of 1316 million cash on hand of 73 million and proceeds from exercise of stock options and related tax benefits of 58 million were used to fund capital expenditures of 188 million acquisitions of 130 million a reduction in sales of receivables of 110 million and a net reduction in bank debt of 810 million 

during the second quarter 2003 the company completed a refinancing of its senior credit facilities borrowings of 6250 million under a new bank loan agreement bank agreement described below were used to repay 4395 million outstanding under the companys previous bank agreement redeem all outstanding senior subordinated notes totaling 1487 million including the call premium of 47 million and to pay other fees and expenses associated with the refinancing of 89 million a prepayment of the new bank loan of 370 million was made in june with excess borrowing proceeds and cash flow from operations and additional prepayments of 890 million were made in the second half of 2003 the refinancing had the effect of extending the maturity of the companys debt coming due in 2003 through 2007 

the companys new bank agreement includes a term loan consisting of a tranche a and b and a 1250 million revolving credit facility at december 31 2003 the tranche a had a balance of 900 million and matures over the period 2006 to 2008 and the tranche b had a balance of 4090 million and matures in 2010 the revolving credit facility expires in 2008 availability under the facility at december 31 2003 was 1172 million after a reduction of 78 million for outstanding letters of credit the companys interest rate on loans under the new bank agreement is libor plus 

200 basis points the bank agreement is secured by a first priority pledge of 100 of the capital stock of the companys direct domestic subsidiaries and 65 of the capital stock of direct material foreign subsidiaries as defined in the bank agreement in addition if the companys credit rating as assigned by standard  poors or moodys were to decline to bb or ba3 respectively the company would be required to perfect liens in favor of participants in the bank agreement in substantially all of the companys us based assets at december 31 2003 the companys credit rating from standard and poors was bb and from moodys was ba2 the bank agreement requires that the company satisfy certain financial covenants including an interest coverage ratio of higher than 3x ebitda divided by interest expense and a leverage test debt divided by ebitda lower than 38x at december 31 2003 such ratios as defined in the bank agreement were 782x and 249x respectively the bank agreement also includes limitations with respect to among other things indebtedness in excess of 50 million for capital leases 200 million for general indebtedness and 200 million for acquisition indebtedness of which approximately 21 million 0 and 0 were outstanding at december 31 2003 and restricted payments including dividends on the companys common stock in excess of 50 of consolidated cumulative net income or approximately 390 million at december 31 2003 in conjunction with entering into the new bank agreement the company entered into interest rate swap agreements that fixed the companys libor interest rate on 2500 million and 1500 million of floating rate bank debt at 244 and 124 expiring in 2006 and 2004 respectively 

the companys primary ongoing cash requirements will be for operating and capital expenditures product development activities and debt service the companys debt service requirements consist primarily of principal and interest on bank borrowings the companys primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flow the companys revolving credit facility and the sale of receivables under the companys accounts receivable agreement the company expects that ongoing requirements for operating and capital expenditures product development activities and debt service requirements will be funded from these sources however the companys sources of liquidity could be adversely affected by among other things a decrease in demand for the companys products a deterioration in certain of the companys financial ratios or a deterioration in the quality of the companys accounts receivable 

the company expects that capital expenditures in 2004 will be approximately 40 million the companys required debt and capital lease amortization in 2004 is 107 million the companys required cash interest payments for 2004 at current interest rates are estimated at approximately 22 million the company may also use cash to fund part or all of the cost of future acquisitions the company has not paid and does not have any present intention to commence payment of cash dividends on its common stock however this policy will be reviewed on an ongoing basis management believes that the companys working capital position ability to generate strong cash flow from operations and access to credit markets will allow it to meet its obligations for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future 

accounts receivable securitization 

a subsidiary of the company has an agreement with a financial institution whereby the subsidiary can sell an undivided interest of up to 850 million in a designated pool of qualified accounts receivable the company services administers and collects the receivables on behalf of the purchaser the agreement includes certain covenants and provides for various events of termination the agreement expires in may 2004 it is the companys intention to renew or replace the agreement at expiration on similar terms at december 31 2003 approximately 738 million of receivables were sold under the agreement and are therefore not reflected in the accounts receivable balance in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 

environmental matters 

subsequent to the acquisition of amphenol from allied signal corporation in 1987 allied signal merged with honeywell international inc in december 1999 honeywell amphenol and honeywell have been named jointly and severally liable as potentially responsible parties in relation to several environmental cleanup sites amphenol and honeywell have jointly consented to perform certain investigations and remedial and monitoring activities at two sites and they have been jointly ordered to perform work at another site the costs incurred relating to these three sites are currently reimbursed by honeywell based on an agreement entered into in connection with the acquisition in 1987 for sites covered by this agreement to the extent that conditions or circumstances occurred or existed at the time of or prior to the acquisition honeywell is obligated to reimburse amphenol 100 of such costs honeywell representatives work closely with the company in addressing the most significant environmental liabilities covered by the agreement management does not believe that the costs associated with resolution of these or any other environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition or results of operations the environmental investigation remedial and monitoring activities identified by the company including those referred to above are covered under the honeywell agreement 

inflation and costs 

the cost of the companys products is influenced by the cost of a wide variety of raw materials including precious metals such as gold and silver used in plating aluminum copper brass and steel used for contacts shells and cable and plastic materials used in molding connector bodies inserts and cable in general increases in the cost of raw materials labor and services have been offset by price increases productivity improvements and cost saving programs 

risk management 

the company has to a significant degree mitigated its exposure to currency risk in its business operations by manufacturing and procuring its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold so that costs reflect local economic conditions in other cases involving us export sales raw materials are a significant component of product costs for the majority of such sales and raw material costs are generally dollar based on a worldwide scale such as basic metals and petroleum derived materials

pensions 

the company and its domestic subsidiaries have a defined benefit pension plan plan covering substantially all us employees plan benefits are generally based on years of service and compensation and are generally noncontributory certain foreign subsidiaries also have defined benefit plans covering their employees 

the pension expense credit for all pension plans approximated 65 million 7 million and 3 million in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively and is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions established on january 1 of the applicable year including an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets in developing the expected longterm rate of return assumption for us plans we evaluated input from our actuaries and investment consultants as well as longterm inflation assumptions projected returns by such consultants are based on broad equity and bond indices we also considered our historical fourteen year compounded return of 114 which has been in excess of these broad equity and bond benchmark indices our expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of 60 with equity managers with an expected longterm rate of return of 11 25 with fixed income managers with an expected longterm rate of return of 675 and 15 with high yield bond managers with an expected rate of return of 85 as of december 31 2003 our asset allocation was 63 with equity managers and 37 with fixed income managers including high yield managers we believe that our longterm asset allocation on average will approximate 60 with equity managers and 40 with fixed income managers we regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate based on this methodology the companys expected longterm rate of return assumption is 95 for both 2003 and 2004 

the discount rate used by the company for valuing pension liabilities is based on a review of high quality corporate bond yields with maturities approximating the remaining life of the projected benefit obligations the discount rate on this basis has decreased from 65 at december 31 2002 to 615 at december 31 2003 this will have the effect of increasing pension expense in 2004 by approximately 8 million although future changes to the discount rate are unknown had the discount rate increased or decreased 50 basis points the pension liability would have decreased 116 million or increased 128 million respectively 

the financial markets declined significantly in 2002 which had an adverse effect on plan assets this resulted in a 425 million noncash charge to the accumulated other comprehensive loss account component of stockholders equity such charge represented an increase in the accrued pension liabilities of 670 million net of deferred taxes the company made a cash contribution to the us pension plans in 2003 of 100 million the liability for accrued pension and post employment benefit obligations declined modestly in 2003 to 1003 million from 1024 million in 2002 as the positive impact on assets of improved investment returns was offset by the negative impact on accumulated liabilities of the reduction in the discount rate and the foreign currency translation effect for nonus plans the company estimates that based on current actuarial calculations it will make a cash contribution to the pension plan in 2004 of approximately 10 million cash contributions in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors including the investment performance of plan assets 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates 

estimates are adjusted as new information becomes available the companys significant accounting policies are set forth below 

revenue recognition—sales and related cost of sales are recognized upon shipment of products allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts discounts returns and allowances are provided based upon historical experience current trends and specific information which indicates that an allowance is appropriate 

inventories—inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost which approximates average cost or market provisions for slow moving and obsolete inventory are provided based on historical experience and product demand should future product demand change existing inventory could become slow moving or obsolete and provisions would be increased accordingly 

depreciable assets—property plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation the appropriateness and the recoverability of the carrying value of such assets are periodically reviewed taking into consideration current and expected business conditions historically the company has not had any significant impairments 

the significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 to the companys consolidated financial statements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the company in the normal course of doing business is exposed to the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

the company conducts business in several international currencies through its worldwide operations and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the companys sales gross margins and retained earnings the company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk by producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold and thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency and by managing its working capital although there can be no assurance that this approach will be successful especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the companys worldwide operations the company does not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes 

interest rate risk 

relative to interest rate risk the company completed a refinancing of its senior credit facilities during the second quarter 2003 as discussed in liquidity and capital resources above in conjunction with the refinancing the company entered into interest rate swap agreements that fixed the companys libor interest rate on 2500 million and 1500 million of floating rate debt at 244 and 124 expiring in 2006 and 2004 respectively at december 31 2003 the companys average libor rate was 18 a 10 change in the libor interest rate at december 31 2003 would have the effect of increasing or decreasing interest expense by approximately 1 million the company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2004 although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly change

owners and occupiers of sites containing hazardous substances as well as generators of hazardous substances are subject to broad liability under various federal and state environmental laws and regulations including expenditures for cleanup and monitoring costs and potential damages arising out of past disposal activities such liability in many cases may be imposed regardless of fault or the legality of the original disposal 

  

 

activity the company is currently performing monitoring activities at its manufacturing site in sidney new york the company is also performing monitoring investigation design and cleanup activities at three offsite disposal sites previously utilized by the company’s sidney facility and others the “richardson hill” landfill the “route 8” landfill and the “sidney center” landfill the company and honeywell have entered into an administrative consent order with the united states environmental protection agency the “epa” and are presently determining necessary and appropriate remedial measures for “richardson hill” which has been designated a “superfund” site on the national priorities list under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 with respect to the second site the “route 8” landfill the company initiated a remediation program pursuant to a consent order with the new york department of environmental protection and is continuing to monitor the results of those remediation efforts in december 1995 the company and honeywell received a letter from the epa demanding that the company and honeywell accept responsibility for the investigation and cleanup of the third site sidney center landfill another superfund site the sidney center landfill was a municipal landfill site utilized by the company’s sidney facility and other local towns and businesses in 1996 the company and honeywell received a unilateral order from the epa directing the company and honeywell to perform certain investigation design and cleanup activities at the sidney center landfill site the company and honeywell responded to the unilateral order by agreeing to undertake certain remedial design activities in 1997 the epa filed a lawsuit against the company and honeywell seeking reimbursement of past costs expended by the epa in connection with activities at the sidney center landfill site and seeking to affix liability upon the company and honeywell for all additional costs to be incurred in connection with all further investigations design and cleanup activities at the sidney center landfill site the company joined four local municipalities as codefendants in the lawsuit in 2001 the company and honeywell were ordered by the court to pay the epa approximately 35 million net of contributions by the municipalities who had been joined as codefendants in the lawsuit pursuant to that decision the company and honeywell will be responsible for completing the remedial design work and for implementing any agreed remediation plan at the sidney center landfill site the municipalities who were joined in the lawsuit have agreed to monitor and maintain any caps installed at the sidney center landfill site as part of any remediation plan the company and honeywell will be responsible for continuing groundwater monitoring at the site the company is also engaged in remediating or monitoring environmental conditions at certain of its other manufacturing facilities and has been named as a potentially responsible party for cleanup costs at other offsite disposal sites during 2002 the company incurred costs of approximately 7 million net of indemnification payments received from honeywell in connection with investigating remediating and monitoring environmental conditions at all of these facilities and sites in 2003 amphenol expects such expenditures net of expected indemnification payments from honeywell to be less than 10 million 

  

since 1987 the company has not been identified nor has it been named as a potentially responsible party with respect to any other significant onsite or offsite hazardous waste matters in addition the company believes that all of its manufacturing activities and disposal practices since 1987 have been in material compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations nonetheless it is possible that the company will be named as a potentially responsible party in the future with respect to additional superfund or other sites although the company is unable to predict with any reasonable certainty the extent of its ultimate liability with respect to any pending or future environmental matters the company believes based upon all information currently known by management about the company’s manufacturing activities disposal practices and estimates of liability with respect to all known environmental matters that any such liability will not be material to its financial condition or results of operations

tableend   

the following discussion and analysis of the results of operations for the three fiscal years ended december 31 2002 has been derived from and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements contained herein 

  

results of operations 

  

the following table sets forth the components of net income as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated 

  

   

2002 compared to 2001 

  

net sales were 10620 million for the year ended december 31 2002 compared to 11038 million for 2001 sales of interconnect products and assemblies decreased 2 compared to 2001 8923 million in 2002 versus 9068 million in 2001 such decrease is primarily attributable to decreased sales approx 528 million of products and interconnect systems for telecom infrastructure datacom and industrial markets such declines were partially offset by increased sales approx 383 million of products and interconnect systems for military aerospace automotive and wireless handset markets sales of cable products decreased 14 compared to 2001 1697 million in 2002 versus 1970 million in 2001 such decrease is primarily attributable to a slowdown in capital spending by us and international cable television operators the lower levels of spending are not expected to change significantly in the near term 

  

geographically sales in the us in 2002 decreased approximately 7 compared to 2001 5011 million in 2002 versus 5389 million in 2001 international sales for 2002 decreased approximately 1 in us dollars 5609 million in 2002 versus 5648 million in 2001 and decreased approximately 3 in local currency compared to 2001 the comparatively weaker us dollar in 2002 had the currency effect of increasing net sales by approximately 144 million when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2001 

  

the gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales including depreciation in cost of sales was 31 for 2002 compared to 33 for 2001 the decrease in gross profit margin is generally attributable to a difficult pricing environment particularly in the communications markets and the adverse effect on production costs of the lower sales volume partially offset by cost reduction programs the pricing environment in communication related markets is expected to remain difficult in the near term 

  

selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales remained relatively constant at approximately 14 for both 2002 and 2001 

  

goodwill amortization expense was nil in 2002 as a result of adopting fas no 142 whereas goodwill amortization was 143 million in 2001 

  

interest expense was 459 million for 2002 compared to 561 million for 2001 the decrease is 

  

 

primarily attributable to lower average debt levels and lower interest rates at current interest rates interest expense for 2003 is expected to be approximately 35 million 

  

other expenses net for 2002 and 2001 was 54 million and 56 million respectively see note 8 to the company’s consolidated financial statements for details of the components of other expenses net 

  

the provision for income taxes for 2002 was at an effective rate of 35 compared to 38 in 2001 for 2001 the effective tax rate excluding nondeductible goodwill amortization was 35 

  

2001 compared to 2000 

  

net sales were 11038 million for the year ended december 31 2001 compared to 13597 million for 2000 sales of interconnect products and assemblies decreased 10 compared to 2000 9068 million in 2001 versus 10092 million in 2000 such decrease is primarily attributable to decreased sales of products and interconnect systems for telecom infrastructure datacom and industrial markets such declines were partially offset by increased sales of products and interconnect systems for military aerospace and automotive markets sales of cable products decreased 44 compared to 2000 1970 million in 2001 versus 3505 million in 2000 such decrease is primarily attributable to a slowdown in capital spending by certain us and international cable television operators 

  

geographically sales in the us in 2001 decreased approximately 25 compared to 2000 5389 million in 2001 versus 7148 million in 2000 international sales for 2001 decreased approximately 12 in us dollars 5648 million in 2001 versus 6449 million in 2000 and decreased approximately 9 in local currency compared to 2000 the comparatively strong us dollar in 2001 had the currency effect of decreasing net sales by approximately 228 million when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2000 

  

the gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales including depreciation in cost of sales remained relatively constant at approximately 33 for both 2001 and 2000 cost reduction activities in 2001 contributed to offsetting the adverse effect of lower sales volume 

  

selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales remained relatively constant at approximately 14 for both 2001 and 2000 

  

interest expense was 561 million for 2001 compared to 617 million for 2000 the decrease is primarily attributable to lower average debt levels and lower interest rates 

  

other expenses net for 2001 and 2000 was 56 million and 95 million respectively see note 8 to the company’s consolidated financial statements for details of the components of other expenses net

cash provided by operating activities totaled 1316 million 1189 million and 1542 million for 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively the increase in cash from operating activities in 2002 compared to 2001 is primarily attributable to a net decrease in noncash components of working capital offset in part by a decrease in net income in 2001 the decrease in cash from operating activities is primarily attributable to a decrease in net income adjusted for depreciation and amortization charges and to a net increase in noncash components of working capital 

  

cash from operating activities was used for capital expenditures 188 million 386 million and 531 million in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively and acquisitions 338 million 605 million and 677 million in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively

our pension cost credit for all pension plans approximated 7 million 3 million and 3 million in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively and is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions established on january 1 of the applicable year including an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets in developing our expected longterm rate of return assumption we evaluated input from our actuaries and investment consultants as well as longterm inflation assumptions projected returns by such consultants are based on broad equity and bond indices we also considered our historical 13 year compounded return of 108 which has been in excess of these broad equity and bond benchmark indices our expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of 60 with equity managers with an expected longterm rate of return of 11 25 with fixed income managers with an expected longterm rate of return of 675 and 15 with high yield bond managers with an expected rate of return of 85 because of market fluctuation our actual asset allocation as of december 31 2002 was 50 with equity managers and 50 with fixed income managers including high yield managers we believe however that our longterm asset allocation on average will approximate 60 with equity managers and 40 with fixed income managers we regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate based on this methodology the company reduced the expected longterm rate of return assumption by 100 basis points to 95 beginning in 2003 this will have the effect of increasing pension expense in 2003 by approximately 2 million 

  

the discount rate used by the company for valuing pension liabilities is based on a review of high quality corporate bond yields with maturities approximating the remaining life of the projected benefit obligations the discount rate on this basis has decreased from 725 at december 31 2001 to 65 at december 31 2002 this will have the effect of increasing pension expense in 2003 by approximately 2 million although future changes to the discount rate are unknown had the discount rate increased or decreased 50 basis points the pension liability would have decreased 95 million or increased 104 million respectively 

  

the financial markets have declined significantly in recent years which has had an adverse effect on plan assets in 2002 this resulted in a 425 million noncash charge to the accumulated other comprehensive loss account component of stockholders’ equity such charge represents an increase in the accrued pension liabilities of 670 million net of deferred taxes the company estimates that based on 

  

 

current actuarial calculations it will make a cash contribution to the pension plans in 2003 of approximately 70 million cash contributions in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors including the investment performance of plan assets 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates the company’s significant accounting policies are set forth below 

  

revenue recognition  sales and related cost of sales are recognized upon shipment of products allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts discounts returns and allowances are provided based upon historical experience current trends and specific information which indicates that an allowance is appropriate 

  

inventories  inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost which approximates average cost or market provisions for slow moving and obsolete inventory are provided based on historical experience and product demand 

  

depreciable assets  property plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation the appropriateness and the recoverability of the carrying value of such assets is periodically reviewed taking into consideration current and expected business conditions 

  

the significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 to the company’s consolidated financial statements 

  




 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

the company in the normal course of doing business is exposed to the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 

  

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

  

the company conducts business in several international currencies through its worldwide operations and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposures due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively effect the company’s sales gross margins and retained earnings the company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk by producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold and thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency and by managing its working capital although there can be no assurance that this approach will be successful especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the company’s worldwide operations the company does not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes 

  

interest rate risk 

  

the company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on its financing activities the company has utilized interest rate swap agreements to manage and mitigate its exposure to changes in interest rates the company had two fixed rate interest swap agreements totaling 450 million that expired in 2002 at december 31 2002 the company’s average libor rate was 19 a 10 change in the libor interest rate at december 31 2002 would have the effect of increasing or decreasing interest expense by approximately 3 million the company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2003 although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly change

     cable products the company designs manufactures and markets coaxial cable
primarily for use in the cable television industry the company manufactures two
primary types of coaxial cable semiflexible which has an aluminum tubular
shield and flexible which has one or more braided metallic shields
semiflexible coaxial cable is used in the trunk and feeder distribution portion
of cable television systems and flexible cable also known as drop cable is
used primarily for hookups from the feeder cable to the cable television
subscribers residence flexible cable is also used in other communication
applications the company has also developed a broadline of radio frequency
connectors for coaxial cable and fiber optic interconnect components for full
service cable televisiontelecommunication networks

     the rapid development in fiber optic technologies digital compression
which allows several channels to be transmitted within the same bandwidth that
a single analog channel currently requires and other communication
technologies including the companys development of higher capacity coaxial
cable have resulted in technologies which enable cable television systems to
provide channel capacity in excess of 500 channels such expanded channel
capacity along with other component additions permit cable operators to offer
full service networks with a variety of capabilities including near
videoondemand payperview special events home shopping networks
interactive entertainment and education services telephone services and
highspeed access to data resources such as the internet with respect to
expanded channel capacity systems cable operators have generally adopted and
the company believes that for the foreseeable future will continue to adopt a
cable system using both fiber optic cable and coaxial cable such systems
combine the advantages of fiber optic cable in transmitting clear signals over a
long distance without amplification with the advantages of coaxial cable in
ease of installation low cost and compatibility with the receiving components
of the customers communication devices the company believes that while system
operators are likely to increase their use of fiber optic cable for the trunk
and feeder portions of the cable systems there will be an ongoing need for high
capacity coaxial cable for the local distribution and streettothehome
portions of the cable system


     us cable system designs are increasingly being employed in international
markets where cable television penetration is low for example it is estimated
that in 2001 only 31 of the television households in europe subscribed to some
form of multichannel television service as compared to an estimated
subscription rate of 69 in the us the estimated subscription rates in the
asian and latin american markets are even lower at approximately 30 and 23
respectively in terms of television households it is estimated that there are
232 million television households in europe 470 million in asia and 83 million
in latin america this compares to an estimated 105 million television
households in the us in 2001 the company had sales of coaxial cable in
approximately 50 countries and the company believes the development of cable
television systems in international markets presents a significant opportunity
to increase sales of its coaxial cable products

     the company is also a leading producer of flatribbon cable a cable made
of wires assembled side by side such that the finished cable is flat
flatribbon cable is used to connect internal components in systems with space
and component configuration limitations the product is used in computer and
office equipment components as well as in a variety of telecommunication
applications

substantial quantity of machinery and equipment most of which is general
purpose machinery and equipment using tools and fixtures and in many instances
having automatic control features and special adaptations the companys plants
warehouses machinery and equipment are in good operating condition are well

intended purposes utilization of the facilities varies based on demand for the
products the company continuously reviews its anticipated requirements for
facilities and based on that review may from time to time acquire or lease
additional facilities andor dispose of existing facilities



item 3  legal proceedings

     the company and its subsidiaries have been named as defendants in several
legal actions in which various amounts are claimed arising from normal business
activities although the amount of any ultimate liability with respect to such
matters cannot be precisely determined in the opinion of management such
matters are not expected to have a material effect on the companys financial
condition or results of operations

     certain operations of the company are subject to federal state and local
environmental laws and regulations which govern the discharge of pollutants into
the air and water as well as the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous
wastes the company believes that its operations are currently in substantial
compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations and that the
costs of continuing compliance will not have a material effect on the companys
financial condition or results of operations

     subsequent to the acquisition of amphenol from allied signal corporation in
1987allied signal merged with honeywell international inc in december 1999
honeywell amphenol and honeywell have been named jointly and severally
liable as potentially responsible parties in relation to several environmental
cleanup sites amphenol and honeywell have jointly consented to perform certain
investigations and remedial and monitoring activities at two sites and they have
been jointly ordered to perform work at another site the responsibility for
costs incurred relating to these three sites is apportioned between amphenol and
honeywell based on an agreement entered into in connection with the acquisition
in 1987 for sites covered by this agreement to the extent that conditions or
circumstances occurred or existed at the time of or prior to the acquisition
honeywell is currently obligated to pay 80 of the costs up to 30 million and
100 of the costs in excess of 30 million at december 31 2001 approximately
26 million of costs have been incurred applicable to this agreement honeywell
representatives work closely with the company in addressing the most significant
environmental liabilities

     owners and occupiers of sites containing hazardous substances as well as
generators of hazardous substances are subject to broad liability under various
federal and state environmental laws and regulations including expenditures for
cleanup and monitoring costs and potential damages arising out of past disposal
activities such liability in many cases may be imposed regardless of fault or
the legality of the original disposal

activity the company is currently performing monitoring activities at its
manufacturing site in sidney new york the company is also performing
monitoring investigation design and cleanup activities at three offsite
disposal sites previously utilized by the companys sidney facility and
others the richardson hill landfill the route 8 landfill and the
sidney center landfill the company and honeywell have entered into an
administrative consent order with the united states environmental protection
agency the epa and are presently determining necessary and appropriate
remedial measures for richardson hill which has been designated a
superfund site on the national priorities list under the comprehensive
environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 with respect
to the second site the route 8 landfill the company initiated a
remediation program pursuant to a consent order with the new york department
of environmental protection and is continuing to monitor the results of those
remediation efforts in december 1995 the company and honeywell received a
letter from the epa demanding that the company and honeywell accept
responsibility for the investigation and cleanup of the third site sidney
center landfill another superfund site the sidney center landfill was a
municipal landfill site utilized by the companys sidney facility and other
local towns and businesses in 1996 the company and honeywell received a
unilateral order from the epa directing the company and honeywell to perform
certain investigation design and cleanup activities at the sidney center
landfill site the company and honeywell responded to the unilateral order by
agreeing to undertake certain remedial design activities in 1997 the epa
filed a lawsuit against the company and honeywell seeking reimbursement of
past costs expended by the epa in connection with activities at the sidney
center landfill site and seeking to affix liability upon the company and
honeywell for all additional costs to be incurred in connection with all
further investigations design and cleanup activities at the sidney center
landfill site the company joined four local municipalities as codefendants
in the lawsuit in 2001 the company and honeywell were ordered by the court
to pay the epa approximately 35 million net of contributions by the
municipalities who had been joined as codefendants in the lawsuit pursuant
to that decision the company and honeywell will be responsible for completing
the remedial design work and for implementing any agreed remediation plan at
the sidney center landfill site the municipalities who were joined in the
lawsuit have agreed to monitor and maintain any caps installed at the sidney
center landfill site as part of any remediation plan the company and
honeywell will be responsible for continuing groundwater monitoring at the
site the company is also engaged in remediating or monitoring environmental
conditions at several of its other manufacturing facilities and has been
named as a potentially responsible party for cleanup costs at several other
offsite disposal sites during 2001 the company incurred costs of
approximately 9 million net of indemnification payments received from
honeywell in connection with investigating remediating and monitoring
environmental conditions at all of these facilities and sites in 2002
amphenol expects such expenditures net of expected indemnification payments
from honeywell to be less than 10 million

     since 1987 the company has not been identified nor has it been named as a
potentially responsible party with respect to any other significant onsite or
offsite hazardous waste matters in addition the company believes that all of
its manufacturing activities and disposal practices since 1987 have been in
material compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations
nonetheless it is possible that the company will be named as a potentially
responsible party in the future with respect to additional superfund or other
sites although the company is unable to predict with any reasonable certainty
the extent of its ultimate liability with respect to any pending or future
environmental matters the company believes based upon all information
currently known by management about the companys manufacturing activities
disposal practices and estimates of liability with respect to all known
environmental matters that any such liability will not be material to its
financial condition or results of operations

2001 compared to 2000

     net sales were 11038 million for the year ended december 31 2001
compared to 13597 million for 2000 sales of interconnect products and
assemblies decreased 10 compared to 2000 9068 million in 2001 versus
10092 million in 2000 such decrease is primarily attributable to
decreased sales of products and interconnect systems for telecom
infrastructure datacom and industrial markets such declines were partially
offset by increased sales of products and interconnect systems for military
aerospace and automotive markets sales of cable products decreased 44
compared to 2000 1970 million in 2001 versus 3505 million in 2000 such
decrease is primarily attributable to a slowdown in capital spending by
certain us and international cable television operators

     geographically sales in the us in 2001 decreased approximately 22
compared to 2000 5383 million in 2001 versus 6907 million in 2000
international sales for 2001 including export sales decreased approximately
15 in us dollars 5655 million in 2001 versus 6690 million in 2000 and
decreased approximately 12 in local currency compared to 2000 the
comparatively strong us dollar in 2001 had the currency effect of decreasing
net sales by approximately 228 million when compared to foreign currency
translation rates in 2000

     the gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales including
depreciation in cost of sales remained relatively constant at approximately 33
for both 2001 and 2000 cost reduction activities in 2001 contributed to
offsetting the adverse effect of lower sales volume

     selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales
remained relatively constant at approximately 14 for both 2001 and 2000

     interest expense was 561 million for 2001 compared to 617 million for
2000 the decrease is primarily attributable to lower average debt levels and
lower interest rates

     other expenses net for 2001 and 2000 was 56 million and 95 million
respectively see note 8 to the companys consolidated financial statements for
details of the components of other expenses net

assemblies increased 31 compared to 1999 10092 million in 2000 versus
7700 million in 1999 such increase is primarily attributable to increased
sales of products and interconnect systems for internet equipment and

upgrades wireless network infrastructures and mobile handsets in addition

experienced growth in 2000 sales of cable products increased 46 compared to
1999 3505 million in 2000 versus 2406 million in 1999 sales of coaxial
cable for cable television increased as cable operators continued to upgrade
and expand their systems to offer enhanced services

compared to 1999 6907 million in 2000 versus 5195 million in 1999

36 in usdollars 6690 million in 2000 versus 4911 million in 1999 and
increased approximately 44 in local currency compared to 1999 the
comparatively strong us dollar in 2000 had the currency effect of
decreasing net sales by approximately 361 million when compared to foreign
currency translation rates in 1999

     the gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales including
depreciation in cost of sales increased approximately 1 for 2000 compared to
1999 the increase in gross profit margin is primarily attributable to changes
in product mix and the absorption of fixed costs over higher sales volume

     selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales
remained relatively constant at approximately 14 in 2000 compared to 1999

     interest expense was 617 million for 2000 compared to 793 million 1999
the decrease is primarily attributable to lower average debt levels

     other expenses net for 2000 and 1999 was 95 million and 53 million
respectively see note 8 to the companys consolidated financial statements for
details of the components of other expenses net

     the provision for income taxes for 2000 was at an effective rate of 38
compared to an effective rate of 42 in 1999 the decrease is generally
attributable to nondeductible expenses goodwill amortization being a lower
percentage of pretax income

liquidity and capital resources

     cash provided by operating activities totaled 1189 million 1542
million and 641 million for 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively the decrease
in cash from operating activities in 2001 compared to 2000 is primarily
attributable to a decrease in net income adjusted for depreciation and
amortization charges and to a net increase in noncash components of working
capital in 2000 the increase in cash from operating activities is primarily
attributable to an increase in net income adjusted for depreciation and
amortization charges

     cash from operating activities was used for capital expenditures 386
million 531 million and 235 million in 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively
and acquisitions 605 million 677 million and 123 million in 2001 2000

under generally accepted accounting principles gaap and is not an alternative
to operating income or cash flow from operations as determined under gaap the
company believes that ebitda provides additional information for determining its
ability to meet future debt service requirements however ebitda does not
reflect cash available to fund cash requirements

     the companys primary ongoing cash requirements will be for operating and
capital expenditures product development activities and debt service
requirements the companys debt service requirements consist primarily of
principal and interest on bank borrowings and interest on its 9 78 senior
subordinated notes due 2007notes the companys primary sources of liquidity
are internally generated cash

flow the companys revolving credit facility and the sale of receivables under
the companys current sale of accounts receivable agreement the company expects
that operating and capital expenditures product development activities and debt
service requirements will be funded from these sources however the companys
sources of liquidity could be adversely affected by a decrease in demand for the
companys products a deterioration in certain of the companys financial ratios
or a deterioration in the quality of the companys accounts receivable

     the company has not paid and does not have any present intention to
commence payment of cash dividends on its common stock the company expects
that capital expenditures in 2002 will be approximately 40 million the
companys required debt amortization in 2002 is 60 million the companys
required cash interest payments for 2002 at current interest rates are
estimated at approximately 50 million the company may also use cash to fund
part or all of the cost of future acquisitions

     in december 1999 the company sold 275 million shares of common stock in a
public offering resulting in net proceeds of 1818 million 1055 million of
such proceeds was used to redeem 96 million principal amount of notes at a
price of 109875 and the balance of the proceeds was used to pay down term debt
under the bank agreement the redemption of notes resulted in an extraordinary
loss for the early extinguishment of debtconsisting of a prepayment premium and
the write off of related deferred debt issuance costs of 136 million less
tax benefits of 49 million

environmental matters

     subsequent to the acquisition of amphenol from allied signal corporation in
1987 allied signal merged with honeywell international inc in december 1999
honeywell amphenol and honeywell have been named jointly and severally
liable as potentially responsible parties in relation to several environmental
cleanup sites amphenol and honeywell have jointly consented to perform certain
investigations and remedial and monitoring activities at two sites and they have
been jointly ordered to perform work at another site the responsibility for
costs incurred relating to these three sites is apportioned between amphenol and
honeywell based on an agreement entered into in connection with the acquisition
in 1987 for sites covered by this agreement to the extent that conditions or
circumstances occurred or existed at the time of or prior to the acquisition
honeywell is currently obligated to pay 80 of the costs up to 30 million and
100 of the costs in excess of 30 million at december 31 2001 approximately
26 million of costs have been incurred applicable to this agreement honeywell
representatives work closely with the company in addressing the most
significant environmental liabilities management does not believe that the
costs associated with resolution of these or any other environmental matters
will have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition or
results of operations

inflation and costs

     the cost of the companys products is influenced by the cost of a wide
variety of raw materials including precious metals such as gold and silver used
in plating aluminum copper brass and steel used for contacts shells and
cable and plastic materials used in molding connector bodies inserts and
cable in general increases in the cost of raw materials labor and services
have been offset by price increases productivity improvements and cost saving
programs

risk management

     the company has to a significant degree mitigated its exposure to currency
risk in its business operations by manufacturing and procuring its products in
the same country or region in which the products are sold so that costs reflect
local economic conditions in other cases involving us export sales raw
materials are a significant component of product costs for the majority of such
sales and raw material costs are generally dollar based on a worldwide scale
such as basic metals and petroleum derived materials

recent accounting changes

     in june 2001 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued
fas no 141 business combinations and no 142 goodwill and other intangible
assets among other provisions all future business combinations will be
accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and the use of the pooling
of interest method is prohibited in addition goodwill will no longer be
amortized but will be subject to impairment tests at least annually the company
adopted fas no 141 effective july 1 2001 and will adopt fas no 142 effective
january 1 2002 although certain provisions were applied to an acquisition that
closed subsequent to june 30 2001 such application had the effect of reducing
amortization of goodwill expense in 2001 by approximately 4 million while the
company is in the process of evaluating the effect of this new standard it
anticipates that discontinuing of the amortization of goodwill beginning in 2002
will have the effect of reducing expenses by approximately 145 million and
the company does not anticipate that it will recognize an impairment loss of
goodwill on adoption of such standard

     in august 2001 the financial accounting standards board issued fas
no 143 accounting for asset retirement obligations this pronouncement
addresses the recognition and remeasurement of obligations associated with the
retirement of tangible longlived assets in october 2001 the

                                       18

page

fasb issued fas no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long
lived assets which addresses accounting and reporting for the impairment or
disposal of longlived assets including discontinued operations the company
will adopt fas no 143 and fas no 144 effective january 1 2002 the company
is in the process of evaluating the effect these new standards will have on
the companys financial statements

euro currency conversion

     on january 1 1999 certain member countries of the european union
established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies and the
european unions common currency the euro the transition period for the
introduction of the euro began on january 11999 beginning january 1 2002 the
participating countries issued new eurodenominated bills and coins for use in
cash transactions no later than july 1 2002 the participating countries will
withdraw all bills and coins denominated in the legacy currencies so that the
legacy currencies will no longer be legal tender for any transactions making
the conversion to the euro complete

     based on progress to date the company believes that the use of the euro
will not have a significant impact on the manner in which it conducts its
business accordingly conversion to the euro is not expected to have a material
effect on the companys consolidated financial position consolidated results of
operations or liquidity

critical accounting policies and estimates

     the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual
results could differ from those estimates the companys significant accounting
policies are set forth below

     revenue recognition  sales and related cost of sales are recognized upon
shipment of products allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts
discounts returns and allowances are provided based upon historical experience
current trends and specific information which indicates that an allowance is
appropriate

     inventoriesinventories are stated at the lower of standard cost which
approximates average cost or market provisions for slow moving and obsolete
inventory are provided based on historical experience and product demand

     depreciable assets  property plant and equipment are carried at cost less
accumulated depreciation the appropriateness and the recoverablility of the
carrying value of such assets is periodically reviewed taking into consideration
current and expected business conditions

     the significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 to
the companys consolidated financial statements

item 7a
         quantitative and qualitative  disclosures about market risk

     the company in the normal course of doing business is exposed to the
risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest
rates

foreign currency exchange rate risk

     the company conducts business in several major international currencies
through its worldwide operations and as a result is subject to foreign exchange
exposures due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies changes in
exchange rates can positively or negatively effect the companys sales gross
margins and retained earnings the company attempts to minimize currency
exposure risk by producing its products in the same country or region in which
the products are sold and thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in
the same currency and by managing its working capital although there can be no
assurance that this approach will be successful especially in the event of a
significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international
currencies of the companys worldwide operations the company does not engage
in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes






interest rate risk

     the company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest
rates based on its financing activities the company utilizes interest rate swap
agreements to manage and mitigate its exposure to changes in interest rates at
december 31 2001 the company had interest rate volatility protection in the
form of such swaps that effectively fixed the companys libor interest rate on
450 million of floating rate bank debt at 576 at december 31 2001 the
three month libor rate was 19 these swap agreements expire in 2002 a 10
change in the libor interest rate at december 31 2001 would have the effect of
increasing or decreasing interest expense by approximately 5 million the
company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on
income or cash flows in 2002 although there can be no assurances that interest
rates will not significantly change

      cable products the company designs manufactures and markets coaxial
cable primarily for use in the cable television industry the company
manufactures two primary types of coaxial cable semiflexible which has an
aluminum tubular shield and flexible which has one or more braided metallic
shields semiflexible coaxial cable is used in the trunk and feeder
distribution portion of cable television systems and flexible cable also known
as drop cable is used primarily for hookups from the feeder cable to the cable
television subscribers residence flexible cable is also used in other
communication applications the company has also developed a broad line of radio
frequency connectors for coaxial cable and fiber optic interconnect components
for full service cable televisiontelecommunication networks

      the rapid development in fiber optic technologies digital compression
which allows several channels to be transmitted within the same bandwidth that
a single analog channel currently requires and other communication
technologies including the companys development of higher capacity coaxial
cable have resulted in technologies which enable cable television systems to
provide channel capacity in excess of 500 channels such expanded channel
capacity along with other component additions will permit cable operators to
offer full service networks with a variety of capabilities including near
videoondemand payperview special events home shopping networks
interactive entertainment and education services telephone services and
highspeed access to data resources such as the internet with respect to
expanded channel capacity systems cable operators have generally adopted and
the company believes that for the foreseeable future will continue to adopt a
cable system using both fiber optic cable and coaxial cable such systems
combine the advantages of fiber optic cable in transmitting clear signals over a
long distance without amplification with the advantages of coaxial cable in
ease of installation low cost and compatibility with the receiving components
of the customers communication devices the company believes that while system
operators are likely to increase their use of fiber optic cable for the trunk
and feeder portions of the cable systems there will be an ongoing need for high
capacity coaxial cable for the local distribution and streettothehome
portions of the cable system

      us cable system designs are increasingly being employed in international
markets where cable television penetration is low for example it is estimated
that in 2000 only 31 of the television households in europe subscribed to some
form of multichannel television service as compared to an estimated subscription
rate of 68 in the us the estimated subscription rates in the asian and latin
american markets are even lower at approximately 29 and 16 respectively in
terms of television households it is estimated that there are 256 million
television households in europe 470 million in asia and 112 million in latin
america this compares to an estimated 101 million television households in the
us in 2000 the company had sales of coaxial cable in approximately 60
countries and the company believes the development of cable television systems
in international markets presents a significant opportunity to increase sales of
its coaxial cable products

      the company is also a leading producer of flatribbon cable a cable made
of wires assembled side by side such that the finished cable is flat
flatribbon cable is used to connect internal components in systems with space
and component configuration limitations the product is used in computer and
office equipment components as well as in a variety of telecommunications
applications

item 2 properties

      the companys fixed assets include certain plants and warehouses and a
substantial quantity of machinery and equipment most of which is general
purpose machinery and equipment using tools and fixtures and in many instances
having automatic control features and special adaptations the companys plants
warehouses machinery and equipment are in good operating condition are well
maintained and substantially all of its facilities are in regular use the
company considers the present level of fixed assets along with planned capital
expenditures as suitable and adequate for operations in the current business
environment at december 31 2000 the company operated a total of 64 plants and
warehouses of which a the locations in the us had approximately 18 million
square feet of which 8 million square feet were leased and b the locations
outside the us had approximately 17 million square feet of which 10 million
square feet were leased

      the company believes that its facilities are suitable and adequate for the
business conducted therein and are being appropriately utilized for their
intended purposes utilization of the facilities varies based on demand for the
products the company continuously reviews its anticipated requirements for
facilities and based on that review may from time to time acquire or lease
additional facilities andor dispose of existing facilities



item 3 legal proceedings

      the company and its subsidiaries have been named as defendants in several
legal actions in which various amounts are claimed arising from normal business
activities although the amount of any ultimate liability with respect to such
matters cannot be precisely determined in the opinion of management such
matters are not expected to have a material effect on the companys financial
condition or results of operations

      certain operations of the company are subject to federal state and local
environmental laws and regulations which govern the discharge of pollutants into
the air and water as well as the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous
wastes the company believes that its operations are currently in substantial
compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations and that the
costs of continuing compliance will not have a material effect on the companys
financial condition or results of operations

      subsequent to the acquisition of amphenol from allied signal corporation
allied subsequently merged with honeywell international inc in 1987
amphenol and allied have been named jointly and severally liable as potentially
responsible parties in relation to several environmental cleanup sites amphenol
and allied have jointly consented to perform certain investigations and remedial
and monitoring activities at two sites and they have been jointly ordered to
perform work at another site the responsibility for costs incurred relating to
these sites is apportioned between amphenol and allied based on an agreement
entered into in connection with the acquisition for sites covered by this
agreement to the extent that conditions or circumstances occurred or existed at
the time of or prior to the acquisition allied is currently obligated to pay
80 of the costs up to 30 million and 100 of the costs in excess of 30
million at december 31 2000 approximately 215 million of total costs have
been incurred applicable to this agreement allied representatives are presently
working closely with the company in addressing the most significant potential
environmental liabilities including the sidney center landfill and the
richardson hill landfill projects as described below

      owners and occupiers of sites containing hazardous substances as well as
generators of hazardous substances are subject to broad liability under various
federal and state environmental laws and regulations including expenditures for
cleanup costs and damages arising out of past disposal activities such
liability in many cases may be imposed regardless of fault or the legality of
the original disposal activity the company is currently


                                       11
page

monitoring activities at its manufacturing site in sidney new york currently
the company is also voluntarily performing monitoring investigation design and
cleanup activities at two local public offsite disposal sites previously
utilized by the sidney facility and others the company is also performing
proposed remedial design activities and is currently negotiating with respect to
a third site the company and allied have entered into an administrative consent
order with the united states environmental protection agency the epa and are
presently determining necessary and appropriate remedial measures for one such
site the richardson hill landfill used by amphenol and other companies
which has been designated a superfund site on the national priorities list
under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act
of 1980 with respect to the second site the route 8 landfill used
exclusively by amphenol the company initiated a remediation program pursuant to
a consent order with the new york department of environmental protection and is
continuing to monitor the results of those remediation efforts in december
1995 the company and allied received a letter from the epa demanding that the
company and allied accept responsibility for the investigation and cleanup of
the sidney center landfill another superfund site the sidney center landfill
was a municipal landfill site utilized by the companys sidney facility and
other local towns and businesses the company has acknowledged that it sent
general plant refuse but no hazardous waste to the sidney center landfill site
in 1996 the company and allied received a unilateral order from the epa
directing the company and allied to perform certain investigation design and
cleanup activities at the sidney center landfill site the company and allied
responded to the unilateral order by agreeing to undertake certain remedial
design activities in 1997 the epa filed a lawsuit against the company and
allied seeking to recover 27 million for past costs expended by the epa in
connection with activities at the sidney center landfill site and seeking to
affix liability upon the company and allied for all additional costs to be
incurred in connection with all further investigations design and cleanup
activities at the site the company joined four local municipalities as
codefendants in the lawsuit the epa and the four municipalities entered into a
proposed settlement agreement which the company and allied have successfully
contested as being unfair and inequitable a similar settlement proposal was not
offered to the company and allied the company and allied intend to continue to
vigorously defend the lawsuit although remedial design work for the sidney
center landfill site has continued pursuant to the 1996 unilateral order the
company is also engaged in remediating or monitoring environmental conditions at
several of its other manufacturing facilities and has been named as a
potentially responsible party for cleanup costs at several other offsite
disposal sites during 2000 the company incurred costs of approximately 15
million net of indemnification payments received from allied in connection
with investigating remediating and monitoring environmental conditions at all
of these facilities and sites amphenol expects such expenditures net of
expected indemnification payments from allied to be less than 10 million in
2001

      since 1987 the company has not been identified nor has it been named as a
potentially responsible party with respect to any other significant onsite or
offsite hazardous waste matters in addition the company believes that all of
its manufacturing activities and disposal practices since 1987 have been in
material compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations
nonetheless it is possible that the company will be named as a potentially
responsible party in the future with respect to additional superfund or other
sites although the company is unable to predict with any reasonable certainty
the extent of its ultimate liability with respect to any pending or future
environmental matters the company believes based upon all information
currently known by management about the companys manufacturing activities
disposal practices and estimates of liability with respect to all known
environmental matters that any such liability will not be material to its
financial condition or results of operations

2000 compared to 1999

      net sales were 13597 million for the year ended december 31 2000
compared to 10106 million for 1999 sales of interconnect products and
assemblies increased 31 compared to 1999 10092 million in 2000 versus
7700 million in 1999 such increase is primarily attributable to increased
sales of products and interconnect systems for internet equipment and upgrades
wireless network infrastructures and mobile handsets in addition sales of
interconnect products for industrial and aerospace applications experienced
growth in 2000 sales of cable products increased 46 compared to 1999 3505
million in 2000 versus 2406 million in 1999 sales of coaxial cable for cable
television increased as cable operators continued to upgrade and expand their

36 in us dollars 6690 million in 2000 versus 4911 million in 1999 and
increased approximately 44 in local currency compared to 1999 the
comparatively strong us dollar in 2000 had the currency effect of decreasing
net sales by approximately 361 million when compared to foreign currency
translation rates in 1999

      the gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales including
depreciation in cost of sales increased approximately 1 for 2000 compared to
1999 the increase in gross profit margin is primarily attributable to changes
in product mix and the absorption of fixed costs over higher sales volume

      selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales
remained relatively constant at approximately 14 in 2000 compared to 1999

      interest expense was 617 million for 2000 compared to 793 million for
1999 the decrease is primarily attributable to lower average debt levels

      other expenses net for 2000 was 95 million see note 8 to the companys
consolidated financial statements for details of the components of other
expenses net

      the provision for income taxes for 2000 was at an effective rate of 38
compared to an effective rate of 42 in 1999 the decrease is generally
attributable to nondeductible expenses goodwill amortization being a lower
percentage of pretax income

      net sales were 10106 million for the year ended december 31 1999
compared to 9189 million for 1998 sales of interconnect products and
assemblies increased 7 compared to 1998 7700 million in 1999 versus 7181

communications applications reflecting the continuing build and enhancements to
wireless communication infrastructure and


                                       16
page

mobile communication devices as well as increasing internet communication
applications the increase was partially offset by a decline in sales of
interconnect products for aerospace applications reflecting lower builds of
commercial aircraft customer inventory reduction programs and lower activity
for the international space station program sales of cable products increased
20 compared to 1998 2406 million in 1999 versus 2008 million in 1998
sales of coaxial cable for cable television increased as cable operators
continued to upgrade and expand their systems to offer enhanced services and
international markets for cable television strengthened especially in the

17 in us dollars 4911 million in 1999 versus 4190 million in 1998 and
increased approximately 19 in local currency compared to 1998 the

depreciation in cost of sales remained relatively constant at approximately 32
in 1999 compared to 1998

remained relatively constant at approximately 14 in 1999 compared to 1998

      interest expense was 793 million for 1999 compared to 812 million for
1998 the decrease is primarily attributable to lower interest rates on the
companys term loan facility

      other expenses net for 1999 was 53 million see note 8 to the companys
consolidated financial statements for details of the components of other
expenses net

      the provision for income taxes for 1999 was at an effective rate of 42

percentage of pretax income

liquidity and capital resources

      cash provided by operating activities totaled 1542 million 641
million and 532 million for 2000 1999 and 1998 respectively the increase
in cash from operating activities in 2000 compared to 1999 is primarily
attributable to an increase in net income adjusted for depreciation and
amortization charges in 1999 the increase in cash from operating activities is
primarily attributable to an increase in net income adjusted for depreciation
and amortization charges and offset in part by a net increase in noncash
components of working capital

      cash from operating activities was used for capital expenditures 531
million 235 million and 263 million in 2000 1999 and 1998 respectively
and acquisitions 677 million 123 million and 327 million in 2000 1999

      the company has a bank loan agreement bank agreement which includes a
term loan encompassing a tranche a and b and a 150 million revolving credit
facility at december 31 2000 the tranche a had a balance of 2727 million and
matures over the period 2001 to 2004 and the tranche b had a balance of 2845
million and matures over the period 2005 and 2006 at december 31 2000 there
were 5572 million of borrowings outstanding under the term loan facility the
revolving credit facility expires in 2004 and availability under the facility
at december 31 2000 was 1439 million after reduction of 61 million for
outstanding letters of credit the bank agreement is secured by a first priority
pledge of 100 of the capital stock of the companys direct domestic
subsidiaries and 65 of the capital stock of direct material foreign
subsidiaries as defined in the bank agreement the bank agreement also requires
that the company satisfy certain financial covenants including interest coverage
and leverage ratio tests and includes limitations with respect to among other
things indebtedness and restricted payments including dividends on the
companys common stock

      the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements that
effectively fixed the companys interest cost on 450 million of borrowings
under the bank agreement

      the companys ebitda as defined in the bank agreement was 2937 million
and 2056 million for 2000 and 1999 respectively ebitda is not a defined term
under generally accepted accounting principles gaap and is not an alternative
to operating income or cash flow from operations as determined under gaap the
company believes that ebitda provides additional information for determining its
ability to meet future debt service requirements however ebitda does not
reflect cash available to fund cash requirements

      the companys primary ongoing cash requirements will be for debt service
capital expenditures and product development activities the companys debt
service requirements consist primarily of principal and interest on bank
borrowings and interest on its 9 78 senior subordinated notes due
2007notes

      in june 2000 a subsidiary of the company sold an additional 25 million
undivided interest in a designated pool of qualified accounts receivable
bringing total value sold to 85 million the proceeds from the sale were used
to repay indebtedness under the companys bank agreement

      in december 1999 the company sold 275 million shares of common stock in
a public offering resulting in net proceeds of 1818 million 1055 million of
such proceeds was used to redeem 96 million principal amount of notes at a
price of 109875 and the


                                       17
page

balance of the proceeds was used to pay down term debt under the bank agreement
the redemption of notes resulted in an extraordinary loss for the early
extinguishment of debt consisting of a prepayment premium and the write off of
related deferred debt issuance costs of 136 million less tax benefits of 49
million

      the company has not paid and does not have any present intention to
commence payment of cash dividends on its common stock the company expects
that ongoing requirements for debt service capital expenditures and product
development activities will be funded by internally generated cash flow and
availability under the companys revolving credit facility the company expects
that capital expenditures in 2001 will be approximately 60 million the
companys required debt amortization in 2001 is 28 million the companys
required cash interest payments for 2001 at current interest rates are
estimated at approximately 50 million the company may also use cash to fund
part or all of the cost of future acquisitions

environmental matters

      subsequent to the acquisition of amphenol corporation in 1987 amphenol
and allied signal corporation allied subsequently merged with honeywell
international inc have been named jointly and severally liable as potentially
responsible parties in relation to several environmental cleanup sites amphenol
and allied have jointly consented to perform certain investigations and remedial
and monitoring activities at two sites and have been jointly ordered to perform
work at another site the responsibility for costs incurred relating to these
sites is apportioned between amphenol and allied based on an agreement entered
into in connection with the acquisition for sites covered by this agreement to
the extent that conditions or circumstances occurred or existed at the time of
or prior to the acquisition allied is currently obligated to pay 80 of the
costs up to 30 million and 100 of the costs in excess of 30 million at
december 31 2000 approximately 215 million of the total costs have been
incurred applicable to this agreement management does not believe that the
costs associated with resolution of these or any other environmental matters
will have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition or

variety of raw materials including precious metals such as gold and silver used
in plating aluminum copper brass and steel used for contacts shells and
cable and plastic materials used in molding connector bodies inserts and
cable in general increases in the cost of raw materials labor and services
have been offset by price increases productivity improvements and cost saving
programs

risk management

      the company has to a significant degree mitigated its exposure to currency
risk in its business operations by manufacturing and procuring its products in
the same country or region in which the products are sold so that costs reflect
local economic conditions in other cases involving us export sales raw
materials are a significant component of product costs for the majority of such
sales and raw material costs are generally dollar based on a worldwide scale
such as basic metals and petroleum derived materials

financial accounting standards no 133 fas 133 accounting for derivative
instruments and hedging activities this statement requires that an entity

financial position and measure those instruments at fair value the accounting
for changes in the fair value of a derivative that is gains and losses
depends on the intended use of the derivative and its resulting designation the
company will adopt fas 133 as amended by fas 138 beginning january 1 2001

million in accumulated other comprehensive income

established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies and the
european unions common currency the euro the transition period for the
introduction of the euro began on january 1 1999 beginning january 1 2002

use in cash transactions no later than july 1 2002 the participating
countries will withdraw all bills and coins denominated in the legacy
currencies so that the legacy currencies will no longer be legal tender for any
transactions making the conversion to the euro complete

will not have a significant impact on the manner in which it conducts its
business accordingly conversion to the euro is not expected to have a material
effect on the companys consolidated financial position consolidated results of

foreign currency exchange rate risk

      the company conducts business in several major international currencies
through its worldwide operations and as a result is subject to foreign exchange
exposures due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies changes in
exchange rates can positively or negatively effect the companys sales gross
margins and retained earnings the company attempts to minimize currency
exposure risk by producing its products in the same country or region in which
the products are sold and thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in
the same currency and by managing its working capital although there can be no
assurance that this approach will be successful especially in the event of a
significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international
currencies of the companys worldwide operations the company does not engage in
purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes

interest rate risk

      the company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest
rates based on its financing activities the company utilizes interest rate swap
agreements to manage and mitigate its exposure to changes in interest rates at
december 31 2000 the company had interest rate protection in the form of such
swaps that effectively fixed the companys libor interest rate on 450 million
of floating rate bank debt at 576 at december 31 2000 the three month libor
rate was 64 these swap agreements expire in 2002 a 10 change in the libor
interest rate at december 31 2000 would have the effect of increasing or
decreasing interest expense by approximately 7 million the company does not
expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash
flows in 2001 although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not
significantly change
